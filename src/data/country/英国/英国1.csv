The literature shows that the impacts of LDC on residents in host regions can be diverse. To understand this diversity, this paper explores the potential mediating role of social capital between LDC impacts in a host region and the well-being of its residents. Using detailed information on residents' social capital in a remote region, this paper confirms the negative relationship between LDC impacts and resident well-being, but it finds no evidence of social capital's mediating role.

It has quietly underpinned understandings of economic structure ever since. The limitations and influence of this basic breakdown have led to many critiques and extensions, but no replacements. Inspired by Henri Lefebvre's The Urban Revolution (1968), we develop a four-sector model that replaces services with sectors focused on urbanization and control. We argue that this model is a better reflection of material economic life, and a more useful way of approaching the 21st-century economy.

We do this in a minimum volatility setting, where we model regret directly as the maximum difference between our volatility and that of a given benchmark. Portfolio managers are also given the option of computing regret as a proportion of the benchmark's performance, which is more in line with market practice than other approaches suggested in the literature. Furthermore, we propose using regret as an extra constraint rather than as a brand new objective function, so practitioners can maintain their current framework. We also look into how such a triple optimization problem can be solved or at least approximated for a general class of objective functions and uncertainty and benchmark sets. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of this approach by examining its performance against other common methods in the literature in several equity markets.","[Simoes, Goncalo; Hauser, Raphael] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Simoes, Goncalo; Hauser, Raphael] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [McDonald, Mark; Fenn, Daniel] HSBC Bank, FX Quantitat Res, London E14 5HQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; HSBC Holdings,"Simoes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Simoes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.",simoes@maths.ox.ac.uk,,"Hauser, Raphael/0000-0002-1166-5329",HSBC studentship,HSBC studentship,While undertaking this work Goncalo was the recipient of a HSBC studentship.,,21,6,7,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We urgently need to assess human impacts on ecosystems which cause changes in structural feedbacks producing large, hard to reverse changes in state and functioning. System dynamics has proven to be a useful and versatile methodology for modelling complex systems given the comparative ease with which feedback loops can be modelled. However, a common issue arises when models become too large and structurally complex to understand the causal drivers of system behaviour. There is a need for an intermediate level of analysis capable of identifying causal driving structures and dynamics, regardless of model complexity. This study investigates Loop Eigenvalue Elasticity Analysis, a structural analysis technique commonly used in business and economic system dynamics models, and evaluates its utility for identifying feedback loop structures responsible for behavioural changes in complex ecological systems. The approach is demonstrated by analysing a simple lake system model that has been extensively studied in the past for its capacity to undertake critical transitions between alternative stable states. We show how the dominance of feedback loops can be tracked through time building influence over the system's behaviour decades prior to the actual collapse in the system. We discuss our findings in the context of studying complex ecosystems and socio-ecological systems.","[Abram, Joseph J.] Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Abram, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",jjalg13@soton.ac.uk,,,EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre grant [EP/G03690X/1],EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre grant (EP/G03690X/1).,,48,4,5,0,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We establish the convergence rates of our estimator for the cases of mildly/severely ill-posed models and ordinary/super smooth measurement errors. We characterize how the presence of measurement error slows down the convergence rates of the estimator.

The model is calibrated for a stylized middle-income economy in Latin America and used to perform a range of experiments, including both individual labor market reforms (cuts in the minimum wage and unemployment benefit rates) and composite reform programs involving additional measures. The results show that individual reforms may generate conflicting effects on growth and welfare in the long run, even in the presence of positive policy externalities. A reduction in training costs may also create an oversupply of qualified labor and higher unemployment in the long run.

As a result, recent policy and research attention has focused on the potential for temporal flexibility of demand, especially in the context of intermittent low-carbon generation. Much of this work emphasises the need to understand what makes up the peak and to engineer solutions to meet this 'normal' consumption. However, today's patterns of temporal consumption may only be a snapshot of continuing change. This paper uses UK household time-use survey data to analyse change in temporal patterns of activities over the last 40 years to shed light on apparent temporal shifts in overall UK electricity demand. The results highlight long term evolution in when and where people work, travel, eat, use media and carry out social activities. In particular they suggest that changing patterns of labour market participation may be contributing to shifts in food related, personal/home care and media activities which correlates with shifts in electricity demand. We conclude that both stable and dynamic social structures and forms of organisation have direct implications for policy debates around current and future flexible demand-side solutions.","[Anderson, Ben] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton, Hants, England; [Torriti, Jacopo] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England",University of Southampton; University of Reading,"Anderson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton, Hants, England.",b.anderson@soton.ac.uk; j.torriti@reading.ac.uk,"Anderson, Benjamin/J-7292-2019","Anderson, Ben/0000-0003-2092-4406; Torriti, Jacopo/0000-0003-0569-039X","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011723/1, EP/P000630/1]; RCUK Energy Programme; EPSRC [EP/P000630/1, EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant numbers EP/K011723/1 and EP/P000630/1] as part of the RCUK Energy Programme.

Overall, these results are consistent with the mispricing hypothesis as a motive for repurchases and as an explanation for the buyback anomaly.

By capturing this intersectorial, international, inter-regional movements of global debt, we aspire to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of global debt and its mode of operation. Second, we attempt to analyse what is wrong with global debt dynamics, that is, we examine the broken link between what global debt was supposed to do and what it does. Here, we point to three interrelated dynamics: the accumulation of unproductive debt, growing inequalities of income and wealth and the increase in privately created, interest-bearing money.

We find that output, education and the share of older people at the regional level can explain attitudes towards immigrants and the European Union. Thus, regions where GDP per capita is low, a high proportion of people has low education, a high proportion is over the age of 65 and there is strong net immigration are more likely to be apprehensive of the European Union, be suspicious of immigrants and not want them as neighbours and, most importantly, to vote for Brexit. The fear of immigration does not seem to be fully justified in terms of the literature on the labour market effects of immigrants in the UK. Using the British Election Study, we find similar results.

We develop a new cross-sectional identification approach, motivated by the insight that investors may differ in their preferred habitats within a broad asset class. We apply the method to the question of whether foreign capital is responsible for residential real estate price movements in global cities such as London and New York, especially during crises.

Using the local Whittle estimator and some of its variants we assess whether relative per capita missions are long memory processes which, although highly persistent, may revert to their mean/trend in the long run thereby indicating evidence of stochastic convergence. Furthermore, we test whether (possibly) slow convergence or the complete lack of it may be the result of structural changes to the deterministics of each of the relative per-capita emissions series by means of the tests of Berkes et al. (Ann Stat 1140-1165, 2006) and Mayoral (Oxford Bull Econ Stat 74(2):278-305, 2012). Our results show relatively weak support for stochastic convergence of emissions, indicating that only between 30 and 40% of the countries converge to the OECD average in a stochastic sense. This weak evidence disappears if we enlarge the sample to include 4 out of the 5 BRICS, indicating that our results are not robust to the inclusion of countries which are experiencing rates of growth which are far larger than those of the OECD members. Our results also decisively indicate that a slow or lack of convergence is not the results of a structural break in the relative emissions series.","[Barassi, Marco R.; Zhao, Yuqian] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Spagnolo, Nicola] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England; [Spagnolo, Nicola] CNR, ISSM, Naples, Italy; [Spagnolo, Nicola] Natl Australian Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Birmingham; Brunel University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi Sulle Societa Del Mediterraneo (ISSM-CNR); Australian National University,"Barassi, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.r.barassi@bham.ac.uk,,"Barassi, Marco/0000-0001-8945-2457",,,,,45,18,19,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an eco-compensation program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). Eco-compensation is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.","[Bennett, Michael T.] 555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA; [Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhoongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane,Room 178, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Econ, Verona, Italy",Renmin University of China; Durham University; University of Waikato; University of Verona,"Bennett, MT (通讯作者)，555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA.",bennett.michaelt@gmail.com; ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009",,,,,,113,44,48,7,157,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We decompose the overall effect into contributions of changes in prices, quality and variety. Estimating trade elasticities for narrow product categories of EU imports, we infer quality from data on imported values and volumes. For the EU as a whole, we find that trade agreements increased quality by 7% on average but did not affect prices or variety. This translates into a cumulative reduction in the consumer price index of 0.24% over our sample period. We also find a high degree of impact heterogeneity across EU countries, trading partners, and the type of trade agreement, with high-income EU countries seeing much stronger quality increases and larger overall consumer benefits.","[Berlingieri, Giuseppe] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France; [Berlingieri, Giuseppe; Breinlich, Holger; Dhingra, Swati] CEP, Strasbourg, France; [Breinlich, Holger] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Dhingra, Swati] London Sch Econ, London, England",ESSEC Business School; University of Surrey; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Berlingieri, G (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France.;Berlingieri, G (通讯作者)，CEP, Strasbourg, France.",giuseppe.berlingieri@essec.edu; h.breinlich@surrey.ac.uk; s.dhingra@lse.ac.uk,,"Breinlich, Holger/0000-0002-1205-1863; Berlingieri, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0935-4860",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,13,14,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for SAR was based predominantly on five randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of SAR against adalimumab, tocilizumab or placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of SAR against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the company performed three network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: two in patients who had had an inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (one for combination therapies and one for monotherapies) and the other one in patients who had had an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). The company's NMAs concluded that SAR in combination with cDMARDs or as monotherapy has a statistically superior efficacy to cDMARDs and a comparable efficacy to most biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in both populations. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the cost-effectiveness of SAR from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services in seven different populations: (1) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs (cDMARD-IR); (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA for whom methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated; (3) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to a TNFi (TNFi-IR); (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) is not an option; (5) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (6) TNFi-IR patients after RTX; and (7) cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA whose 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is between 4.0 and 5.1. The company's economic evaluation resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy versus its comparators when the comparators were less effective, and it resulted in cost savings higher than 60,000 pound per QALY lost when SAR was less effective, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible (where the ICER for SAR + MTX compared with RTX + MTX was 130,691 pound per QALY gained) and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0 (where the ICER of SAR + MTX compared with MTX was 38,254 pound per QALY gained). Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after applying two changes to the company's model: (1) use of a latent class approach to model Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) progression for patients on cDMARDs; and (2) amendment of the company's modelling of patient progression from moderate to severe RA. The ICERs estimated by the ERG's exploratory analyses for SAR + MTX increased to 171,466 pound per QALY gained when compared with RTX + MTX in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible, and to 63,438 pound per QALY gained when compared with MTX in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0. The Appraisal Committee concluded that SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered populations, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0.","[Bermejo, Inigo; Ren, Shijie; Simpson, Emma; Clowes, Mark; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] Univ Hertsfordshire, Dept Rheumatol, Ctr Lifespan & Chron Illness Res, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; University of Hertfordshire,"Bermejo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",inigo.bermejo@gmail.com,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [19/04/17],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 19/04/17).

We show that a solvency problem in one bank can be transmitted to another if they lend to the same borrower. The novelty is that the channel for the transmission involves banks' monitoring incentives. The intensity with which all banks monitor a common borrower is reduced when one of the banks suffers a solvency shock. The reduced effort intensity affects the borrower's probability of success and creates a contagion (endogenous correlation) from the balance-sheet of the affected bank to the balance-sheet of the other banks lending to the same borrower. Banks hit by a solvency shock have lower incentives to monitor borrowers because less is left after paying depositors. Banks not hit by a solvency shock face borrowers' risks entirely on their own, which increases the expected cost of lending. As a consequence, they respond by reducing the monitoring intensity for the common borrower. Bank equity can mitigate the risk of contagion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, a new firm-level survey, the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), was created to investigate this, finding three key results. First, Brexit was reported to be one of the top three sources of uncertainty for around 40 per cent of UK businesses in the two years after the vote in the June 2016 referendum, and this proportion increased further in Autumn 2018. Hence, Brexit provided both a major and persistent uncertainty shock. Second, uncertainty has been higher in industries that are more dependent on trade with the EU and on EU migrant labour.

However, as the latest National Travel Survey (NTS) reveals, the number of journeys made by bike in the UK has remained steadfastly around only 2% (Department for Transport [DfT], 2018a). By using documentary analysis of the available official policy documents and statements, the aim of this paper is to make sense of the policies that have been published concerning active travel (AT) in England. This is done from a figurational sociological perspective. Three key themes emerge from the analysis: (1) the rhetorical, advisory level of the vast majority of the policies; (2) the reliance on a wide network of local authorities to implement AT policy; and (3) the focus placed on individuals to change their behaviour. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that despite a large number of policy publications from a range of government departments claiming to promote AT, little has actually changed in this time period in terms of a national agenda. Despite the successive policies, it seems there is little appetite on behalf of recent governments to make widespread infrastructural changes, where instead the focus has largely been on persuading the individual to seek more active modes of travel, increasingly for their own, individual 'health' gains.","[Bloyce, Daniel; White, Chris] Univ Chester, Dept Sport & Exercise Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England",University of Chester,"Bloyce, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chester, Dept Sport & Exercise Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England.",d.bloyce@chester.ac.uk,"Bloyce, Daniel/W-4233-2019","White, Chris/0000-0003-4710-4723; Bloyce, Daniel/0000-0003-4114-3588",,,,,99,4,4,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Using two independent samples, we document that parents perceive the returns to different late investments to be higher than the returns to early investments, and that they perceive investments in different time periods as substitutes rather than complements. We show that parental beliefs about the returns to investments vary substantially across the population and that individual beliefs are predictive of actual investment decisions. Moreover, we document that parental beliefs about the productivity of investments differ significantly across socioeconomic groups. Perceived returns to early parental investments are positively associated with household income, thereby potentially contributing to the intergenerational persistence in earnings.","[Boneva, Teodora] UCL, London, England; [Rauh, Christopher] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of London; University College London; Universite de Montreal,"Boneva, T (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",t.boneva@ucl.ac.uk; christopher.raphael.rauh@montreal.ca,,"Rauh, Christopher/0000-0001-6353-1640",British Academy; INET Institute at the University of Cambridge,British Academy; INET Institute at the University of Cambridge,"We are very grateful to the editor and the five anonymous referees, Orazio Attanasio, Eva Berger, Betsy Caucutt, Flavio Cunha, Armin Falk, Christina Gravert, James J.

Before students arrived on campus, we randomly assigned them to all-female, all-male, and coed classes, and thereby avoid the selection issues present in earlier studies on single-sex education of students in primary and secondary school. We find that 1 h a week of single-sex classes benefits women: females score a quarter of standard deviation better overall and are 7.7% more likely to pass their first year course. Furthermore, women assigned to all-females classes in their first year are roughly 57% less likely to drop out of university and are 61% more likely to get a top ranked degree under the UK system. There is evidence that single-sex classes cause women to adopt behaviors associated with better academic outcomes, such as attending more classes and doing optional assignments. However, these behavioral changes cannot explain much of the all-female effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The national program built on preexisting local programs in some, but not all, departements. Using data from multiple waves of a nationally representative biennial survey of the French population, we estimate the effect of organized screening on the percentage of women obtaining a mammogram. The analysis uses difference-in-differences methods to exploit the fact that the program was targeted at women in a specific age group: 50 to 74 years old. We find that organized screening significantly raised mammography rates among women in the target age range. Just above the lower age threshold, the percentage of women reporting that they had a mammogram in the past 2 years increased by over 10 percentage points after the national program went into effect. Mammography rates increased even more among women in their 60s. Estimated effects are particularly large for women with less education and lower incomes, suggesting that France's organized screening program has reduced socioeconomic disparities in access to mammography.","[Buchmueller, Thomas C.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buchmueller, Thomas C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldzahl, Leontine] Univ Manchester, Sch Hlth Sci, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Goldzahl, Leontine] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Manchester; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Buchmueller, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbuch@umich.edu,,"Goldzahl, Leontine/0000-0001-6070-3347; Buchmueller, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-7419",chair Sante at the Fondation du risque; [ANR 11-LABX-0019],chair Sante at the Fondation du risque;,"Goldzahl's work on this paper was supported by a post-doctoral grant co-financed by the chair Sante at the Fondation du risque and the project ANR 11-LABX-0019.

Moreover, competition might itself be an outcome of changes in productivity (e.g. Hoxby, 2003). We provide evidence for the negative effect of the threat of competition on students' test scores in elementary public schools in Poland. The identification strategy uses the introduction of the amendment facilitating the creation of autonomous schools in Poland in 2009 as an external shock to the threat of competition. We focus on the short run in which there is only a limited set of actions available to schools' principals. For the total sample we find no effect, however, for more competitive urban educational markets, we report a drop in test scores in public schools following the increased threat of competition. This negative effect is robust to the existence of autonomous schools prior to the amendment and to the size of public schools. It does not result from a pre-existing or concurrent trend either. We exclude student sorting and adjustments in schools' expenditures as potential channels.","[Bukowski, Pawel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kobus, Martyna] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Bukowski, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.bukowski@lse.ac.uk; mkobus@inepan.waw.pl,"Morales, Fabián/HNS-0601-2023","Kobus, Martyna Agata/0000-0003-2027-4693; Bukowski, Pawel/0000-0003-3795-6308",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under a Mobility Research Award [893/MOB/2012/0]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education under a Mobility Research Award; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Sascha O.

Applying our methodology to U.S. mutual funds and hedge funds, we find most fund alphas decrease with time. Combining our methodology with the bootstrap method which controls for 'luck', positive long-run alphas of mutual funds but hedge funds disappear, while negative long-run alphas of both mutual and hedge funds remain.

The incorporation of the social dimension in choice models creates the need for understanding how social networks evolve over time and in particular which social contacts (alters) are retained over time by an individual (ego). Existing work fails to capture the full extent of ego-level and ego-alter level heterogeneity in these processes. We propose the use of a hybrid model framework which is based on the notion of latent strength of relationship. The resulting model allows for heterogeneity in the latent strength both across individuals and across their different relationships. In addition, we allow for heterogeneity not linked to the latent strength concept. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach using data from Chile, showing the presence of extensive variations in retention of social contacts and in strength of relationship both at the ego and ego-alter level, only some of which can be linked to observed characteristics.","[Calastri, Chiara; Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Choudhury, Charisma] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Calastri, Chiara; Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Choudhury, Charisma] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Antonio Carrasco, Juan] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Universidad de Concepcion,"Calastri, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Calastri, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",c.calastri@leeds.ac.uk; s.hess@its.leeds.ac.uk; andrew@alogit.com; j.carrasco@udec.cl; c.f.choudhury@leeds.ac.uk,"Carrasco, Juan Antonio/M-9948-2019; Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020; Choudhury, Charisma/N-7940-2017","Carrasco, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-9662-7550; Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518; Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745; Choudhury, Charisma/0000-0002-8886-8976","European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS]; Chilean Research, Science, and Technology Council (CONICYT); Programa de Financiamiento Basal para Centros de Excelencia, Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingenieria [FBO-16]","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Chilean Research, Science, and Technology Council (CONICYT); Programa de Financiamiento Basal para Centros de Excelencia, Instituto de Sistemas Complejos de Ingenieria","The Leeds authors acknowledge the financial support by the European Research Council through the consolidator grant 615596-DECISIONS.

This study provides preliminary evidence about the application of the somatic marker hypothesis in investment choices using heart rate and skin conductance response measures. Twenty undergraduate students were split equally into expert (defined by familiarity with investments) and novice (no familiarity) groups, because previous research has associated expertise with cognitive differences in decision making scenarios. Both groups completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Behavioral Investment Allocation Strategy task-a computerized simulation of real trading scenarios-as assessments of investment decision-making in conditions of low versus high uncertainty, as defined by the Bayesian calculation (level of certainty is more than: (1 - ( 300%))/(300% - (- 300%)) = 66.67% (0.67). Results suggest that, although primaryinducers (innate physiological responses) support and guide optimal decision-making in conditions of uncertainty, secondary inducers (physiological responses dependent on memory/experience) moderate this effect; that is, the stressful thoughts that accompany the task restrict optimal decision-making.

Our approach is fully nonparametric in the way that it handles differences in circumstances and provides decompositions of both a rank-dependent relative (the Gini coefficient) and a rank-independent absolute inequality index (the variance). The decompositions distinguish the contribution of effort from the direct and indirect (through effort) contribution of circumstances to the total inequality. Our approach is illustrated by an empirical application that uses objectively measured biomarkers as health outcomes and as proxies for relevant effort variables. Using data from the Health Survey for England from 2003 to 2012, we find that circumstances are the leading determinant of inequality in cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, and in a combined ill-health index whereas effort plays a substantial role in explaining inequality in fibrinogen only.","[Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] RWI Res Network, Essen, Germany; [Jones, Andrew M.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Andrew M.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Salerno; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Monash University,"Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",vcarrieri@unisa.it,"Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021; Jones, Andrew/C-3402-2008","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820; Jones, Andrew/0000-0003-4114-1785",Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship [MRF-2016-004],Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust),"Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: MRF-2016-004",,51,24,24,10,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2018,27,12,,,,,1981,1995,,10.1002/hec.3814,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3814,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GZ7PM,30091293,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000449674000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such a regulatory intervention is likely to have impact on the price formation process and information transmission between markets. We find that the long-run cointegrating relation between the high- and low-risk country groups in Europe broke down as the crisis emerged and the regulatory remedy failed to correct this. Furthermore, we find the information transmission between markets has reversed from the high-risk to low-risk markets in the period following the Lehman demise and imposition of the ban. Further, we notice a similar reversal in the spillover of both return and volatility processes between the different risk-level country groups. We, therefore, conclude that, overall, the 2008 short-selling ban had an adverse impact on information transmission between the identified country portfolios in both the long and short run. Notably, the ban did not restore the pre-crisis transmission channels.","[Chen, Jing] Cardiff Univ, Sch Math, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [McMillan, David G.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Accounting & Finance Div, Stirling, Scotland; [Buckle, Mike] Univ Liverpool, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Cardiff University; University of Stirling; University of Liverpool,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Math, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,"McMillan, David/H-5211-2019","McMillan, David/0000-0002-5891-4193; Chen, Jing/0000-0001-7135-2116; Buckle, Mike/0000-0002-5767-2217",,,,,44,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The impact of expressing emotions in ultimatum bargaining,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Experiment; Ultimatum game; Emotion; Rating; Disapproval aversion,DISAPPOINTMENT AVERSION; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR; GAMES; RECIPROCITY; PUNISHMENT,"Past experimental research has shown that when rating systems are available, buyers are more generous in accepting unfair offers in ultimatum bargaining. However, it also suggests that, under these conditions, sellers behave more fairly to avoid receiving negative feedback. This paper experimentally investigates which effect is stronger with the use of a rating system: buyers' inflated inequity acceptance or sellers' disapproval aversion. We explore this question by varying the information condition on the buyers' side. Our experiment shows that in a setup where the size of the pie is common knowledge for both buyers and sellers, when a rating system is present, the sellers exhibit disapproval aversion but the buyers do not display greater acceptance of inequity. By contrast, when only sellers are aware of the size of the pie, sellers behave aggressively to exploit buyers and their behavior does not change in the presence of a rating system; however, buyers display greater acceptance of inequity when a rating system is present. We discuss how these results can be explained by a theoretical model that includes sellers' social disapproval aversion and buyers' disappointment aversion in addition to the players' inequality aversion.","[Chen, Josie I.] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Daxue Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan; [Kamei, Kenju] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",National Taipei University; Durham University,"Kamei, K (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",josiechen@gm.ntpu.edu.tw; kenju.kamei@gmail.com,"Chen, Josie I/AHA-3570-2022","Chen, Josie I/0000-0002-7276-5817; Kamei, Kenju/0000-0002-7905-8584",Murata Science Foundation in Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST105-2410-H-305-016],"Murata Science Foundation in Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This project was supported by a Grant from the Murata Science Foundation in Japan and from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (MOST105-2410-H-305-016).

Our empirical strategy focuses on lottery winners in an individual fixed-effects framework and hence the variation of winnings arises from within-individual differences in small versus large winnings. The results indicate that lottery winners with larger wins are more likely to choose private health services than public health services from the National Health Service. The positive effect of wins on the choice of private care is driven largely by winners with medium to large winnings (win category 500 pound [or US$750]; mean = 1,922.5 pound [US$2,893.5], median = 1,058.2 pound [US$1,592.7]). There is some evidence that the effect of winnings vary by whether individuals have private health insurance. We also find weak evidence that large winners are more likely to take up private medical insurance. Large winners are also more likely to drop private insurance coverage between approximately 9 and 10 months earlier than smaller winners, possibly after their winnings have been exhausted. Our estimates for the lottery income elasticities for public health care (relative to no care) are very small and are not statistically distinguishable from zero; those of private health care range from 0 to 0.26 for most of the health services considered, and 0.82 for cervical smear.","[Cheng, Terence C.] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Costa-Font, Joan; Powdthavee, Nattavudh] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Powdthavee, Nattavudh] Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Adelaide; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick,"Cheng, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",terence.cheng@adelaide.edu.au,"Powdthavee, Nattavudh/K-7230-2019; Cheng, Terence C/IQW-2710-2023; Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Powdthavee, Nattavudh/0000-0002-9345-4882; Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG040640] Funding Source: Medline,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,39,7,10,0,68,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Europe is a large continent with a long and rich history, consisting of around 50 countries with vastly different institutional settings and government policies for housing and an abundance of quasi-natural experiments. Some countries have remarkably rich public data and some institutions and policy assumptions are all but the opposite of those familiar to US institutions. In this introduction we briefly outline the seven papers of this issue that exploit in one way or another this extraordinary richness for research. Each paper provides novel insights and has important implications. Collectively, they illustrate the potential opportunities for new and exciting research on housing in Europe.","[Cheshire, Paul C.; Hilber, Christian A.

In the election years the government's primary balance deteriorates via increased expenditures. The political budget cycle appears subdued in the post-Maastricht treaty period, which implies tighter constraints on public finances. We demonstrate, however, that the opportunistic manipulation of public finances lives on, albeit through a different channel. In particular, we produce evidence of electoral effects in the composition of expenditures, with the expenses for compensation to employees increasing during election years. Furthermore, our results show that snap elections affect expenses positively, and prolonged incumbencies affect negatively the government's primary balance and revenues. Finally, no evidence of partisan effects exists in Greece's fiscal policies.","[Chortareas, Georgios] Kings Coll London, Sch Business & Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England; [Papandreou, Andreas A.] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece; [Logothetis, Vassilis E.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of London; King's College London; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Cardiff University,"Chortareas, G (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Business & Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",georgios.chortareas@kcl.ac.uk,"Papandreou, Andreas/AAM-7860-2021","Logothetis, Vasileios/0000-0001-8009-2387",,,,,52,3,4,0,1,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

By contrast, we provide novel evidence showing that parents who helped their adult children in the past are rewarded by higher chances of receiving informal care later in life. To this end we use Italian data containing precise retrospective information about the help with housing that couples received from their parents when they got married, such as a real estate donation or down payment. Our estimates show that this type of past help is positively associated with the current provision of informal care to the parents. This result is robust to controlling for a large set of individual and family characteristics and is only partially due to increased geographical proximity. We suggest that this finding can be explained by mixed self-interest motives, related to theories based on either bilateral exchange or the presence of a third generation (grandchildren), such as the demonstration effect model or the family constitution model.","[Ciani, Emanuele] Bank Italy, Directorate Generale Econ Stat & Res, Struct Econ Anal Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Ciani, Emanuele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Ctr Anal Publ Policies, Via Jacopo Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Deiana, Claudio] European Commiss, CC ME, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Competences 1, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Deiana, Claudio] Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Essex,"Ciani, E (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Generale Econ Stat & Res, Struct Econ Anal Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.;Ciani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Ctr Anal Publ Policies, Via Jacopo Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",emanuele.ciani@bancaditalia.it,"Ciani, Emanuele/B-1836-2016","DEIANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-2576-9997",,,,,47,5,6,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

A seller has an object for sale and can reach buyers only through intermediaries. Intermediaries can either mediate the transaction by buying and resellingthe merchant modeor refer buyers to the seller for a feethe referral mode. When the seller has a strong bargaining position and can condition the asking price to the intermediaries' business model choice, all intermediaries specialize in agency. The seller's and intermediaries' joint profits equal the seller's profits when he has access to all buyers. When the seller does not have such bargaining power, the level of the referral fee and the degree of competition among intermediaries determine the business mode adoption. A hybrid agency-merchant mode may be adopted in equilibrium.

We make two contributions to the literature. First, we build a novel data set comprising 28 SSA countries for the period 2000-14 to uncover the main correlates of LCBM capitalisation, of local currency bond (LCB) tenors and of LCB issue yields. We find that LCBM capitalisation in SSA relates to politico-institutional factors, overall financial development and financial system structure. For LCB tenors and issue yields, inflation levels matter too. Second, we complement our econometric analysis with qualitative case studies of Kenya and Nigeria, where we further investigate the drivers of LCBM development and place LCBMs in a broader public debt context. While we document the increasing importance of LCBMs in SSA, we also highlight new vulnerabilities, including those related to investor base composition.","[Dafe, Florence] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Dafe, Florence; Volz, Ulrich] German Dev Inst DIE, Bonn, Germany; [Essers, Dennis] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy IOB, Antwerp, Belgium; [Volz, Ulrich] SOAS Univ London, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); University of Antwerp; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Dafe, F (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.;Dafe, F (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst DIE, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Essers, Dennis/0000-0002-4572-8826; Dafe, Florence/0000-0001-7337-0027; Volz, Ulrich/0000-0001-9917-8068",,,,,37,19,20,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2018,41,12,,,SI,,3317,3344,,10.1111/twec.12624,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12624,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HE7HH,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000453601800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that any policy approach will have to understand the multi-faceted nature of these new initiatives, and be sensitive to the porous nature of the boundaries between university and private-sector activities.","[Durufle, Gilles] QCC Tech Innovat Platform, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Hellmann, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Wilson, Karen] OECD, Paris, France; [Wilson, Karen] GV Partners, Paris, France",University of Oxford; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Duruflé, G (通讯作者)，QCC Tech Innovat Platform, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",gdurufle@quebeccityconference.com; thomas.hellmann@sbs.ox.ac.uk; karen@gvpartners.com,"Hellmann, Thomas F/KFN-1290-2024","Hellmann, Thomas F/0000-0003-2018-4196",,,,,61,7,11,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In a two-task moral hazard model in which only the agent knows which task is less costly, the agent has an incentive to focus his effort on the less costly task. Opaque schemes, which make a risk-averse agent uncertain about which task will be more highly rewarded, mitigate such gaming but impose more risk.

This paper investigates to what extent the diffusion of mobile broadband has impacted economic development in terms of GDP. The study is based on data for 135 countries (90 countries once controlling for capital, employment and human capital) for the period 2002-2014. The results show that there is a statistically significant effect from mobile broadband on GDP both when mobile broadband is first introduced and gradually as mobile broadband diffuses throughout different economies. Based on a two stage model we are able to conclude that on average a 10 percent increase of mobile broadband adoption causes a 0.8 percent increase in GDP. Moreover, once we control for the years since mobile broadband was introduced, we find that the economic effect gradually decreases over time. For the country with median average growth of mobile broadband penetration, this implies that the economic effect has disappeared 6 years after introduction (if introduction is defined as a mobile penetration of 1 percent).

We first synthesize the emerging literature that links land use policies and local fiscal incentives to urban sprawl. Next, we compile a panel dataset on various measures of urban sprawl for European countries using high-resolution satellite images. We document substantial variation in urban sprawl across countries. This variation remains roughly stable over the period of our analysis (1990-2012). Urban sprawl is particularly pronounced in emerging Central and Eastern Europe but is comparatively low in Northern European countries. Urban sprawl - especially outside functional urban areas - is strongly negatively associated with real house price growth, suggesting a trade-off between urban containment and housing affordability. Our main novel empirical findings are that decentralization and local political fragmentation are significantly positively associated with urban sprawl. Decentralized countries have a 25-30% higher sprawl index than centralized ones. This finding is consistent with the proposition that in decentralized countries fiscal incentives at local level may provide strong incentives to permit residential development at the outskirts of existing developments.","[Ehrlich, Maximilian V.] Univ Bern, Ctr Reg Econ Dev & CESifo, Bern, Switzerland; [Hilber, Christian A.

This is due to a general belief among healthcare policy makers that pharmaceutical expendituredriven by high priceswill be unsustainable unless further reforms are enacted.ObjectiveThe aim of this paper is to provide more realistic expectations of pharmaceutical expenditure for all key stakeholder groups by estimating pharmaceutical expenditure at net' prices. We also aim to estimate any gaps developing between list and net pharmaceutical expenditure for the EU5 countries (i.e. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK).MethodsWe adjusted an established forecast of pharmaceutical expenditure for the EU5 countries, from 2017 to 2021, by reflecting discounts and rebates not previously considered, i.e. we moved from list' to net' prices, as far as data were available.ResultsWe found an increasing divergence between expenditure measured at list and net prices. When the forecasts for the five countries were aggregated, the EU5 (unweighted) average historical growth (2010-2016) rate fell from 3.4% compound annual growth rate at list to 2.5% at net. For the forecast, the net growth rate was estimated at 1.5 versus 2.9% at list.ConclusionsOur results suggest that future growth in pharmaceutical expenditure in Europe is likely to be (1) lower than previously understood from forecasts based on list prices and (2) below predicted healthcare expenditure growth in Europe and in line with long-term economic growth rates. For policy makers concerned about the sustainability of pharmaceutical expenditure, this study may provide some comfort, in that the perceived problem is not as large as expected.","[Espin, Jaime] Andalusian Sch Publ Hlth, Granada, Spain; [Schlander, Michael] Heidelberg Univ, German Canc Res Ctr DKFZ, Div Hlth Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Schlander, Michael] Inst Innovat & Valuat Hlth Care InnoVal HC, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Strathclyde Univ, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Anderson, Pippa] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge] Independent Econ Consultant, Madrid, Spain; [Borget, Isabelle] Gustave Roussy, Serv Biostat & Epidemiol, Villejuif, France; [Borget, Isabelle] Univ Paris Sud, Univ Paris Saclay, UVSQ, CESP,INSERM, Villejuif, France; [Borget, Isabelle] Univ Paris Sud, GRADES, Chatenay Malabry, France; [Hutchings, Adam] Dolon Ltd, London, England; [Parnaby, Adam] Celgene Int, Boudry, Switzerland; [Jommi, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy; [Jommi, Claudio] Cergas Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, SDA Bocconi Sch Management, Milan, Italy",Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Karolinska Institutet; University of Strathclyde; Swansea University; UNICANCER; Gustave Roussy; Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; Bocconi University,"Mestre-Ferrandiz, J (通讯作者)，Independent Econ Consultant, Madrid, Spain.",jormesfer13@gmail.com,"Espin, Jaime/AAF-3732-2020; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019","Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge/0000-0003-0529-1321; Godman, Brian/0000-0001-6539-6972; Borget, Isabelle/0000-0002-6295-6361; ANDERSON, PIPPA/0000-0003-2959-2671; Jommi, Claudio/0000-0002-2862-2990; Espin, Jaime/0000-0001-7299-6554",,,,,67,15,15,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The socioeconomic dynamics generate a pendulum-like switch from markets to a centrally planned economy abolishing private ownership, and back to restoring market incentives. The grand experiment of communism is thus characterized as leading to the discovery of a trade-off between equality and efficiency.

In these sectors the output (education or health respectively) depends on the actions of different agents and iris unclear what the effects of such incentive systems are on the behaviour of untargeted agents. In this study we focus on patient health, modelled as a joint product of patient effort (through lifestyle and behaviour) and doctor effort (through diagnosis and treatment). Patient response to doctor effort is shown to be a priori ambiguous and depends on the degree of complementarity or substitution between doctor and patient effort. We build an empirical model to estimate the effect of doctors' treatment effort on patient behaviour. To address the endogeneity of doctor effort we exploit a change in payments to doctors in the U.K. that led to incentive changes that varied by practice, depending on their prior performance levels. We use panel data on the physical activity, drinking and smoking behaviours of over 2000 cardiovascular disease patients aged over 50 in England and link these data to their primary care practice performance data. Our results indicate that primary care practices increased the proportion of patients with controlled disease from 76% to 83% in response to the payment change.

J,"Fielding, D",,,,"Fielding, David",,,The geography of violence during a presidential election: Evidence from Zimbabwe,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elections; Voter intimidation; Zimbabwe,STATE REPRESSION,"Successful election monitoring depends on the ability to predict where violence will be used to intimidate voters. However, the strategy of a violent electoral candidate will depend on the particular characteristics of the election, including (i) whether other candidates are able to organize violence, (ii) whether the outcome depends on nationwide voting shares or shares in individual electoral districts, and (iii) how costly it is to transport the resources used to perpetrate violent acts. Although there is already ample theory and evidence for some combinations of these characteristics, analysis of other combinations is still lacking. This paper presents a theory designed to analyse strategy in an election in which the outcome depends on nationwide voting shares and only one candidate is able to organize violence, distinguishing between the case of costless transportation and the case in which transportation is prohibitively costly. The theory predicts that in the case of costly transportation with constant returns to scale, violence will be targeted at areas where support for the opposition is relatively low. Evidence suggests that the second round of the 2008 presidential election in Zimbabwe corresponds to such a case, and statistical analysis of the geographical distribution of violence around the time of the election indicates that areas of opposition weakness did indeed suffer more violence.","[Fielding, David] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Fielding, David] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England",University of Otago; University of Oxford,"Fielding, D (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",david.fielding@otago.ac.nz,,"Fielding, David/0000-0003-0506-4233",,,,,34,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Final demand is affected by consumer foresight, that is, consumers may not anticipate the ex post surplus from the secondary good when purchasing the primary good. We first set up a reduced-form platform model and evaluate the effects of consumer foresight on the platform's optimal decisions. Then, we specialize the analysis in the context of airports, which derive revenues from both aeronautical and, increasingly, commercial activities. An airport sets landing fees and, in addition, it chooses the retail market structure by selecting the number of retail concessions to be awarded. We find that, with perfectly myopic consumers, the airport chooses to attract more passengers via low landing fees, and also sets the minimum possible number of retailers in order to increase the concessions' revenues. However, even a very small amount of anticipation of the consumer surplus from retail activities changes significantly the airport's choices: the optimal policy is dependent on the degree of differentiation in the retail market. When consumers instead have perfect foresight, the airport establishes a very competitive retail market. This attracts passengers and it is exploited by the airport by charging higher landing fees, which then constitute the largest share of its profits. Overall, the airport's profits are maximal when consumers have perfect foresight.","[Flores-Fillol, Ricardo] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Spain; [Flores-Fillol, Ricardo] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus, Spain; [Iozzi, Alberto; Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Iozzi, Alberto] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] CEPR, London, England",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Imperial College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Flores-Fillol, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus, Spain.;Flores-Fillol, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus, Spain.",ricardo.flores@urv.cat; alberto.iozzi@uniroma2.it; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk,"; Flores-Fillol, Ricardo/F-3815-2016","Valletti, Tommaso/0000-0001-9728-5513; Flores-Fillol, Ricardo/0000-0002-3506-1634; Iozzi, Alberto/0000-0002-1005-215X",,,,,40,19,19,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Good practice entails: (a) Consistent definition and measurement of overrun; in contrast to mixing inconsistent baselines, price levels, etc. (b) Data collection that includes all valid and reliable data; as opposed to including idiosyncratically sampled data, data with removed outliers, non-valid data from consultancies, etc. (c) Recognition that cost overrun is systemically fat-tailed; in contrast to understanding overrun in terms of error and randomness. (d) Acknowledgment that the root cause of cost overrun is behavioral bias; in contrast to explanations in terms of scope changes, complexity, etc. (e) De-biasing cost estimates with reference class forecasting or similar methods based in behavioral science; as opposed to conventional methods of estimation, with their century-long track record of inaccuracy and systemic bias. Bad practice is characterized by violating at least one of these five points. Love and Ahiaga-Dagbui violate all five. In so doing, they produce an exceptionally useful and comprehensive catalog of the many pitfalls that exist, and must be avoided, for properly understanding and curbing cost overrun.","[Flyvbjerg, Bent; Ansar, Atif; Budzier, Alexander; Stewart, Allison] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Buhl, Soren] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Cantarelli, Chantal] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Garbuio, Massimo; Lovallo, Dan] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Glenting, Carsten] Viegand Maagoe AS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Holm, Mette Skamris] Aalborg Municipal, Aalborg, Denmark; [Lunn, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England; [Molin, Eric] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Ronnest, Arne] Esrum Kloster & Mollegard, Graested, Denmark; [Stewart, Allison] Infrastruct Victoria, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Oxford; Aalborg University; University of Sheffield; University of Sydney; University of Oxford; Delft University of Technology,"Flyvbjerg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.",bent.fiyvbjerg@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Budzier, Alexander/KFB-8557-2024; Garbuio, Massimo/HNI-6134-2023","Molin, Eric/0000-0003-4486-9608; Budzier, Alexander/0000-0002-2132-0412",,,,,92,108,113,2,52,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) require forceful inhalation for optimal delivery, and approximately 40% of Global Initiative for Asthma(GINA)-defined Step-3+ patients inhale corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist through DPIs. The CRITIKAL study (Price et al. in J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract 5:1071-e9-1081-e9, 2017) found a statistically significant association between insufficient inspiratory effort' error and increased risk of uncontrolled asthma and hospitalisation-requiring exacerbations. This paper explores the cost-effectiveness of an error-targeted intervention.MethodsA probabilistic Markov cost-utility model simulated patients transitioning between controlled and uncontrolled health states over oneyear. Odds ratios (ORs, from the CRITIKAL study) of a patient having uncontrolled asthma conditional on making the error were applied to baseline transition probabilities sourced from the literature, both indirectly via an adjustment formula (Zhang et al. in JAMA 280:1690-1691, 1998) and directly by assuming OR approximates relative risk (RR). The analysis explored complete/partial eradication of the error when the intervention was priced to match comparators, as well as impact of indirect costs based on lost/reduced productivity.ResultsThe intervention dominated both DPI comparators overoneyear, with direct cost savings of 45/86 pound with 0.0053/0.0102 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and had the highest probability of being cost-effective at a 20,000 pound/QALY threshold. Key factors driving variance were weekly utilities per state and RR of moving to an uncontrolled state.ConclusionThe analysis demonstrated the economic and societal costs of insufficient inspiratory effort' and potential economic benefits of introducing an effective intervention to reduce/eradicate this error. Further research should assess the economic impact of other handling errors.","[Forster, Rebecca; Dunlop, William C.

The countercyclicality of multilateral development bank (MDB) lending is mostly driven by the behavior of the World Bank (borrowing from regional development banks tends to be acyclical). The paper also shows that MDB lending to Latin America and East Asia is more countercyclical than MDB lending to other regions. Private sector lending is instead procyclical in all developing regions. While the cyclicality of MDB lending does not depend on domestic or international conditions, private lending becomes particularly procyclical in periods of limited global capital flows. By focusing on both borrower and lender heterogeneity, the paper shows that the cyclical properties of international government debt are mostly driven by credit supply shocks. Demand factors appear to be less important drivers of procyclical international government borrowing. The focus on supply and demand factors is different from the traditional push and pull classification, as push and pull factors could affect both the demand and the supply of international government debt.

For the largest European and US banks, as well as European insurers, we uncover a strong relation during exceptional (extreme) days and a weak relation during normal (average) days. Examining days with large increases in short positions and large downfalls in stock prices, we find evidence of both momentum and contrarian short selling taking place. For North American bank stocks, contrarian short selling appears more practiced than for European bank and insurance stocks. We find that the uncovered relationship decreases with firm size and increases during ban periods, which is in line with short selling becoming more informative when constrained.

However, the empirical research about corporate mobility in the EU has so far been limited in two respects: it has focused on the analysis of foreign companies in the UK and it has mainly been concerned with differences in the costs of incorporation such as minimum capital requirements. This paper aims to fill these gaps. It is the first paper that presents data on incorporations of foreign businesses in the commercial registers of each EU Member State. It is also the first one to assess the impact of differences in the conflict of laws rules applicable to companies as they reflect the case law of the Court of Justice on the freedom of establishment. It finds that countries which have a clear-cut version of the 'incorporation theory' attract more incorporations than countries which have retained elements of the 'real seat theory'. The paper also discusses the policy implications from these findings for EU harmonisation in this field. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical evidence in a developing country context in particular is however still scarce. Based on a case study of the Pakistani cement industry, this paper fills this gap. Our study shows that due to interconnected conglomerates' tactics, such as exclusionary practices, the acquisition of smaller competitor firms and the addition of significant capacities, the industry has witnessed a stable degree of seller concentration after broader reforms including privatization. Consequently, colluding conglomerate firms have been able to maintain control over supply and prices for two decades in the post-reform period, despite allegations of tacit collusion leading to the imposition of fines and the issuing of warnings by the regulator, which is, however, weak and inefficient.","[Ghulam, Yaseen] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Ghulam, Yaseen] Al Yamamah Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Portsmouth; Al-Yamamah University,"Ghulam, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England.;Ghulam, Y (通讯作者)，Al Yamamah Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",yaseen.ghulam@port.ac.uk,,"Ghulam, Yaseen/0000-0002-3206-1786",,,,,41,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Using plot-level data from a specifically designed survey conducted in Pakistan, we investigate the productive benefits for farmers who adapt to climate change. The impact of implementing on-farm adaptation strategies is estimated separately for two staple crops: wheat and rice. We employ propensity score matching and endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that farmers self-select into adaptation. Estimated productivity gains are positive and significant for rice farmers who adapted, but negligible for wheat. Counterfactual gains for non-adapters were significantly positive, which is potentially a sign of transactions costs to adaptation. Other factors associated with adaptation were formal credit and extension, underscoring the importance of addressing institutional and informational constraints that inhibit farmers from improving their farming practices.

The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the processes involved in young, married women's negotiations of control over cash inside the extended household in a contemporary rural Nepali setting. We conducted a grounded theory study of 42 households from the Plains of Nepal. Our study uncovered multiple ways in which junior wives and husbands in the extended household became secret allies in seeking financial autonomy from the rule of the mother-in-law to the wife. This included secretly saving up for a household separation from the in-laws. We argue these secret financial strategies constitute a means for junior couples to renegotiate the terms of Kandiyoti's (1988) 'patriarchal bargain' wherein junior wives traditionally had to accept subservience to their husband and mother-in-law in exchange for economic security and eventual authority over their own daughters-in-law. Researchers, activists and policy-makers concerned with women's economic empowerment in comparable contexts should consider the impact of intergenerational power relations on women's control over cash.

In these cases, mapping can be used to estimate preference-based measures. Objectives: To model the relationship between the EQ-5D-3L and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer (FACT-B) instrument, comparing indirect and direct mapping methods, and the use of FACT-B summary score versus FACT-B subscale scores. Methods: We used data from three clinical studies for advanced breast cancer providing 11,958 observations with full information on FACT-B and the EQ-5D-3L. We compared direct mapping using adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMMs) with indirect mapping using seemingly unrelated ordered probit models. The EQ-5D-3L was estimated as a function of FACT-B and other patient-related covariates. Results: The use of FACT-B subscale scores was better than using the total FACT-B score. A good fit to the observed data was observed across the entire range of disease severity in all models. ALDVMMs outperformed the indirect mapping. The breast cancer-specific scale had a strong influence in predicting the pain/discomfort and self-care dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L. Conclusions: This article adds to the growing literature that demonstrates the performance of the ALDVMM method for mapping. Regardless of which model is used, the subscales of FACT-B should be included as independent variables wherever possible. The breast cancer-specific subscale of FACT-B is important in predicting the EQ-5D-3L. This suggests that generic cancer measures should not be used for utility mapping in patients with breast cancer.","[Gray, Laura A.; Wailoo, Allan J.; Alava, Monica Hernandez] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Gray, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",laura.gray@sheffield.ac.uk,"Gray, Laura/AAA-1430-2019","Gray, Laura/0000-0001-6365-7710; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617; Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883",Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme [MR/L022575/1]; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; MRC [MR/L022575/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health and Care Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work was supported by a grant from the Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme (grant no.

The relative costs of financing depend on the efficiency of the financial sector and the sector using financial intermediation services, the production sector. These costs determine the occupational choices and the set of active establishments in the production and financial sectors. A model of establishment-size distributions in the production and financial sectors results. This model is calibrated to match facts about the U.S. economy, such as the interest-rate spread and the establishment-size distributions in the production and financial sectors. The model is then used to evaluate the importance of the technological progress in the production and financial sectors and the observed decline in the real interest rate for the dynamics of the value added and the average establishment size in the production and financial sectors. The model accounts for the observed positive trend in the share of the value added and the negative trend in the average establishment size in the U.S. and Taiwanese financial sectors during the last three decades.

Horizontal power originates from network centrality and is associated with resource access whereas vertical power originates from principal-principal agency conflicts and is associated with exploitation of minority shareholders. We highlight the impact of horizontal and vertical power through their interaction effects with transparency and disclosure (TD) practices on fixed investments and performance in Russian firms. We find that TD and horizontal power or connectedness are substitutes, while whereas TD and vertical power are complements in their effects on fixed investment and firm performance.

However, climate change is an urgent problem - emissions reductions must take place rapidly throughout the coming decades. This raises an important question: how long might it take for individual technologies to emerge from research, find market opportunities and make a tangible impact on emissions reductions? Here, we consider historical evidence for the time a range of energy supply and energy end-use technologies have taken to emerge from invention, diffuse into the market and reach widespread deployment. We find considerable variation, from 20 to almost 70 years. Our findings suggest that the time needed for new technologies to achieve widespread deployment should not be overlooked, and that innovation policy should focus on accelerating the deployment of existing technologies as well as research into new ones.","[Gross, Robert; Hanna, Richard; Heptonstall, Philip] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Ctr Energy Policy & Technol, 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England; [Gambhir, Ajay] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Speirs, Jamie] Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 10 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Hanna, R (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Ctr Energy Policy & Technol, 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NE, England.",r.hanna@imperial.ac.uk,"Speirs, Jamie/ABD-8770-2020; Hanna, Richard/HCH-3014-2022","Speirs, Jamie/0000-0002-6729-9831; Gambhir, Ajay/0000-0002-5079-4537; Heptonstall, Philip/0000-0001-8411-6673",UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme [EP/L024756/1]; Committee on Climate Change; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme; Committee on Climate Change; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The research presented in this paper was undertaken as part of the research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre - Phase 3, which is funded by the UK Research and Innovation Energy Programme (Grant reference EP/L024756/1).

The technique involves sampling parameters from their respective distributions (rather than simply using mean/median parameter values). Guidance in the literature, and from health technology assessment bodies, on the number of simulations that should be performed suggests a sufficient number', or until convergence', which is seldom defined. The objective of this tutorial is to describe possible outcomes from PSA, discuss appropriate levels of accuracy, and present guidance by which an analyst can determine if a sufficient number of simulations have been conducted, such that results are considered to have converged. The proposed approach considers the variance of the outcomes of interest in cost-effectiveness analysis as a function of the number of simulations. A worked example of the technique is presented using results from a published model, with recommendations made on best practice. While the technique presented remains essentially arbitrary, it does give a mechanism for assessing the level of simulation error, and thus represents an advance over current practice of a round number of simulations with no assessment of model convergence.","[Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, London, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.; Bullement, Ash] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Bullement, Ash] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Briggs, Andrew] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stevenson, Matthew D.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; University of Glasgow; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of Alberta; University of Sheffield,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England.",ahatswell@deltahat.co.uk,"Bullement, Ash/IVV-3411-2023; Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016; Bullement, Ash/AEO-3423-2022; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Bullement, Ash/0000-0001-7091-0972; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",,,,,23,55,59,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36,12,,,,,1421,1426,,10.1007/s40273-018-0697-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0697-3,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30051268,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000451183300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The likely solutions to these challenges-such as the transition to clean energy systems-will require yet more innovation. This article presents five policy proposals that would support more innovation of the environmentally beneficial kind and less innovation of the environmentally harmful kind. We argue that the appropriate portfolio of innovation policies for protecting global environmental systems should include pricing natural capital; providing and targeting research and development (R&D) support towards environmentally beneficial innovations, based on the evidence acquired through more rigorous experimental designs; providing early-stage deployment subsidies for environmentally friendly technologies in particular circumstances; supporting collaborative R&D to leverage complementary capabilities in various types of organizations; and reducing barriers to private sector environmental finance. Policies in these five areas could help redirect innovation towards environmentally friendly economic activities.","[Hepburn, Cameron] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Hepburn, Cameron; Pless, Jacquelyn] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst UK, London, England; [Pless, Jacquelyn] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst UK, London, England.",cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk; jacquelyn.pless@inet.ox.ac.uk; dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",Partners for a New Economy (P4NE); Oxford Martin School,Partners for a New Economy (P4NE); Oxford Martin School,We express our gratitude to Frank Convery for encouraging us to pursue this paper and to Suzanne Leonard for her patience.

Treatment failure is often a result of poor medication adherence. Imperfect adherence in clinical trials may lead to biased estimates of treatment effect and confound the results of cost-effectiveness analyses. Objectives: To estimate the impact of varying medication adherence on the cost effectiveness of lesinurad dual therapy and estimate the value-based price of lesinurad at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is equal to 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Methods: Treatment effect was simulated using published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models and scenarios representing adherence in clinical trials, routine practice, and perfect use. The subsequent cost and health impacts, over the lifetime of a patient cohort, were estimated using a bespoke pharmacoeconomic model. Results: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing lesinurad dual ULT with monotherapy ranged from 39,184 pound to 78,350 pound/QALY gained using allopurinol and 31,901 pound to 124,212 pound/QALY gained using febuxostat, depending on the assumed medication adherence. Results assuming perfect medication adherence imply a per-quarter value-based price of lesinurad of 45.14 pound when used in dual ULT compared with allopurinol alone and 57.75 pound compared with febuxostat alone, falling to 25.41 pound and 3.49 pound, respectively, in simulations of worsening medication adherence. Conclusions: The estimated value-based prices of lesinurad only exceeded that which has been proposed in the United Kingdom when assuming both perfect drug adherence and the eradication of gout flares in sustained treatment responders.","[Hill-McManus, Daniel; Hughes, Dyfrig] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Ardudwy Bldg,Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Marshall, Scott; Soto, Elena] Pfizer Ltd, Pharmacometr, Sandwich, Kent, England; [Lane, Steven] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; Pfizer; University of Liverpool,"Hughes, D (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Ardudwy Bldg,Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Hill-McManus, Daniel/AAA-9305-2022; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Hill-McManus, Daniel/0000-0002-1936-3907","Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research [MR/L004933/1-Q25]; MRC North-West Hubs for Trial Methodological Research [MR/K025635/1]; MRC [MR/L004933/1, MR/L004933/2, MR/K025635/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research; MRC North-West Hubs for Trial Methodological Research; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This study was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research (reference no.

The analysis treats poverty as a multi-dimensional and socially disaggregated phenomenon. The paper employs a mixed methods approach to case studies of Ghana and Ethiopia to explore two critical issues. First, how income from cash crops is linked with other dimensions of poverty. Second, how income and land are socially disaggregated. The paper then draws on qualitative data to critically reflect on how poverty is understood within studied communities. The results show that some, but not all, indicators of poverty vary across income quartiles and that significant differences exist across social groups. The analysis suggests that although cash crops are essential, focusing on increasing income from cash crops will not necessarily have a predictable or progressive impact on wellbeing. Furthermore, the analysis highlights how contextual factors, such as the provision of communal services, the nature of land holdings and the quality of local governance mediate the potential poverty alleviating outcomes of income increases. Future development of sustainable intensification strategies should focus on the prevalence of trade-offs and the fundamental social relations underpinning poverty dynamics.","[Hirons, M.; McDermott, C.; Morel, A.; Malhi, Y.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, ECI, Oxford, England; [Robinson, E.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England; [Morel, A.; Norris, K.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Asare, R.; Mason, J.] Nat Conservat Res Ctr, Kaneshie Accra, Ghana; [Boyd, E.] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Gonfa, T.; Gole, T.

Clinician involvement can help modellers to develop clinically valid but straightforward structures; however, there is little guidance available on methods for clinician input to model structure. This study aims to provide an in-depth exploration of clinician involvement in structural development, highlighting key issues and generating recommendations to optimise practices.MethodsA qualitative study was undertaken with a range of modellers and clinicians working in different modelling contexts. In-depth interviews and case studies using observations were carried out to understand how clinicians are involved in model structural development and to identify problems and optimal approaches from informants' perspectives.ResultsTwenty-four interviews and two case studies were undertaken with modellers and modelling teams. Key issues included the number and diversity of clinicians contributing to structural development, potentially impacting the generalisability of structures, and problems with clinician understanding of important information to contribute to model pathways. Modellers and clinicians suggested that clinician training in modelling could enhance structural processes.ConclusionsRecommendations to optimise current practices include recruiting clinicians from a variety of backgrounds and using discussions between experts to develop valid and generalisable structures. Future research should focus on developing training materials for clinicians and finding ways to help modellers recruit clinicians from different settings.","[Husbands, Samantha; Coast, Joanna] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, 1-5 Whiteladies Rd, Bristol BS8 1NU, Avon, England; [Jowett, Susan; Barton, Pelham] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Bristol; University of Birmingham,"Husbands, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, 1-5 Whiteladies Rd, Bristol BS8 1NU, Avon, England.",Samantha.husbands@bristol.ac.uk,"Jowett, Sue/AAO-4198-2021","Jowett, Sue/0000-0001-8936-3745; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166",University of Birmingham; Universitas 21,University of Birmingham; Universitas 21,"Financial support for this study was provided in part by a scholarship from the University of Birmingham, and in part by a PhD Scholarship from Universitas 21 for the Canadian element of the work.",,35,6,6,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36,12,,,,,1453,1462,,10.1007/s40273-018-0705-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0705-7,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30117116,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000451183300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that the UK has become much less integrated into global production networks than other EU countries over the period 2000-14, and is almost unique among EU countries in that the domestic content of its exports increased over this period. This reflects the relatively high and growing domestic service content in UK exports. As a result of this, reducing the UK's tariffs on imported goods is unlikely to have a large direct effect on the average export competitiveness of UK firms. Potentially more significant for the UK is how future trade barriers with the EU are likely to affect its participation in cross-country value chains that meet final demand in markets in North America and East Asia. Such indirect exports are not captured in conventional trade statistics and can only be analysed using a GVC approach. Our findings suggest that the UK will benefit only to a limited extent from bilateral trade agreements with countries outside the EU (a 'Global Britain' strategy) if it gives up its role in the supply chains that service these countries via the EU hub.","[IJtsma, Pieter; Los, Bart; Timmer, Marcel P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Levell, Peter] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Levell, Peter] UCL, London, England",University of Groningen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"IJtsma, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.",p.a.ijtsma@rug.nl; peter_l@ifs.org.uk; b.los@rug.nl; m.p.timmer@rug.nl,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023; timmer, marcel p/A-7716-2008; Los, Bart/ABE-5900-2020",,"ONS Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (CPP) [ES/M010147/1]; 'The UK in a Changing Europe' initiative [ES/R000980/1]; ESRC; Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) [453-14-012]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/R000980/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ONS Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); 'The UK in a Changing Europe' initiative; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Dutch Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to Wen Chen for able research assistance.

We also test the heterogeneity in the debt-growth relationship across developed and developing countries. In our full sample of countries, all types of debt appear to be harmful to economic growth. The negative effect of public debt appears to be uniform across developed and developing countries, although the impact is much stronger on developed countries. Household debt appears to be expansionary in developing countries whereas contractionary in developed countries. Nonfinancial corporation debt appears to have no impact on developing countries but negative impact on developed countries.

Data come from a large representative survey, conducted in post-socialist countries in 2015/16. To deal with endogeneity, we instrument party membership with information on whether family members were affected by the Second World War. Instrumental variable results suggest that links to the former Communist party increase the likelihood of paying bribes today; this result applies to the former party members as well as their children and relatives. Among bribe payers, people with the party links are more likely to offer bribes as well as think that bribe payments are expected. Overall, our findings suggest that the proclivity to corruption of the former Communist party members has been transmitted through family and thus sustained over time, contributing to corruption decades after the demise of the Socialist bloc.","[Ivlevs, Artjoms] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Ivlevs, Artjoms] Inst Study Labor IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Hinks, Timothy] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol Business Sch UWE Bristol, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of West England,"Ivlevs, A (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.;Ivlevs, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",a.ivlevs@uwe.ac.uk; timothy.hinks@uwe.ac.uk,"Hinks, Tim/AAF-7094-2020","Hinks, Timothy/0000-0001-7761-931X; Ivlevs, Artjoms/0000-0002-5398-7705",,,,,48,18,18,1,5,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

We use panel data of 342 MFIs from 61 countries covering the period 2003-2013. Results show that MFIs are operating at a low level of productivity with an overall annual rate of decline in TFP of 1.7 percent. Although technical progress, technical efficiency change and mix efficiency change components of TFP have increased over the study period, overall, TFP actually declined over time due to declining scale efficiency, residual scale-efficiency and/or residual mix efficiency changes. We found variations in regional performance with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the highest decline in TFP despite improvements in technical and mix efficiency changes. In contrast, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and South Asian regions have experienced a growth in TFP. Policy implications of these results are that MFIs should continue to pursue technical progress and aim to improve technical, scale and mix efficiency components by reallocating resources optimally. As well, MFIs should operate at an optimal scale and derive economies of scope by changing input and output mixes. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production.","[Keles, Derya] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, Univ Strasbourg, CNRS,INRA,BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Choumert-Nkolo, Johanna] Econ Dev Initiat EDI Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Motel, Pascale Combes] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, IRD, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Kere, Eric Nazindigouba] African Dev Bank AfDB, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Keles, D (通讯作者)，14 Rue Girardet,CS 14216, F-54042 Nancy, France.",derya.keles@inra.fr; j.choumert.nkolo@surveybe.com; pascale.motel_combes@uca.fr; e.kere@afdb.org,"Combes Motel, Pascale/ABE-9633-2021","Combes Motel, Pascale/0000-0002-3532-2339; Keles, Derya/0000-0003-0755-0913",French National Research Agency (REVE project) [ANR-14-CE05-0008]; French Ministry of Research; BETA,"French National Research Agency (REVE project)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French Ministry of Research(Ministry of Research, France); BETA","This work is part of a research project funded by the French National Research Agency (REVE project, ANR-14-CE05-0008) and the French Ministry of Research.

It draws on theories of intersectionality and colour/cultural racism to argue that the labour market experience of British-Muslim women is multiply determined via criteria of ascription such as ethnicity, migration status, race and religion rather than criteria of achievement. The study uses data from the Labour Force Survey (2002-2013) with a large sample (N=245,391) of women aged 19-65 years. The overarching finding suggests that most Muslim women, regardless of their multiple ascriptive identities, generation and levels of qualifications, still face significant penalties compared with their White-British Christian counterparts. The penalties for some groups, such as Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black-Muslim women, are harsher than for Indian and White-Muslim women, demonstrating how different social markers and multiple identities have contingent relationships to multiple determinants and outcomes.","[Khattab, Nabil] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Doha, Qatar; [Khattab, Nabil] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Hussein, Shereen] Kings Coll London, London, England",Doha Institute for Graduate Studies; University of Bristol; University of London; King's College London,"Khattab, N (通讯作者)，Doha Inst Grad Studies, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Al Tarfa St,Zone 70, Doha, Qatar.",nabil.khattab@bristol.ac.uk,"Hussein, Shereen/AAZ-7837-2021","Hussein, Shereen/0000-0002-7946-0717",,,,,51,29,31,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

J,"Kotzé, LJ; French, D",,,,"Kotze, Louis J.; French, Duncan",,,A critique of the Global Pact for the environment: a stillborn initiative or the foundation for Lex Anthropocenae?,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Global Pact for the Environment; Anthropocene; Lex Anthropocenae; International environmental law; Earth system; Multilateral environmental agreements; Soft law,INTERNATIONAL-LAW,"In May 2018, the process which may ultimately lead to the negotiation of a legally binding Global Pact for the environment formally commenced under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly. Expectations for the Pact are high, evidenced in particular by its multiple and overlapping objectives: to serve as a generic binding instrument of international environmental law (IEL) principles; to integrate, consolidate, unify and ultimately entrench many of the fragmented principles of IEL; and to constitute the first global environmental human rights instrument. In the wake of the impending intergovernmental process, the paper offers a thorough critique of the draft Pact in its present iteration. We do so with the aim of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the present draft Pact by interrogating: (a) its diplomatic and symbolic relevance and possible unique contribution at the policy level to global environmental law and governance, and (b) its potential at the operational level of IEL and global environmental governance, focusing on the extent to which the draft Pact accommodates both existing and more recent rules and principles for environmental protection. As the Pact's primary ambition is to become a universally binding global treaty, it would be churlish not to recognise its potential for innovation, as well as the considerable opportunity that the negotiation of the Pact will have to generate broad-sweeping and positive impacts. However, our central thesis is that only if the Global Pact were to incorporate ambitious normative provisions to strengthen those public and private global governance efforts that aim to halt the deterioration of Earth system integrity, as well as to maintain and improve integrity, will it be able to offer a firm foundation of the type of Anthropocene Law, termed here as the Lex Anthropocenae, required to confront head-on the deep socio-ecological crisis of the Anthropocene.","[Kotze, Louis J.] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Kotze, Louis J.; French, Duncan] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Law Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England",North West University - South Africa; University of Lincoln,"Kotzé, LJ (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.;Kotzé, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Law Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",lkotze@lincoln.ac.uk,,"French, Duncan/0000-0001-6422-7579; Kotze, Louis/0000-0001-5820-168X",,,,,69,42,44,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While a standard model of oligopolistic for-profit competition predicts a positive relationship between market size and firm size, our analogous model of competition between prosocially motivated charities predicts no such correlation. If charities are biased towards their own provision, a positive association between market size and provider size can arise. We examine these predictions empirically for six different local charity markets. Our empirical findings suggest that charities do not solely pursue prosocial objectives, and that increased competition in the charity sector can lead to rationalization in provision.

Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on household growth if their initial consumption lies below a critical threshold. As such, temperature shocks slow income convergence among households, at least in the short run. Crop yields and total factor productivity in agriculture are the main transmission channels. Extrapolating from short-term elasticities to long-run phenomena, these findings support the Schelling Conjecture: economic development would help poor farming households to reduce the impacts of climate change. Hence, closing the yield gap, modernizing agriculture and favouring the structural transformation of the economy are all crucial issues for adaptation of farmers to the negative effects of global warming.

An ETF is an investment vehicle, with a specific architecture that typically seeks to track the performance of a specific index. The first US-listed ETF, the SPDR, was launched by State Street in January 1993 and seeks to track the S&P 500 index. It is still today the largest ETF by far, with assets of $178 billion. Following the introduction of the SPDR, new ETFs were launched tracking broad domestic and international indices, and more specialized sector, region, or country indexes. In recent years, ETFs have grown substantially in assets, diversity, and market significance, including substantial increases in assets in bond ETFs and so-called smart beta funds that track certain investment strategies often used by actively traded mutual funds and hedge funds. In this paper, we begin by describing the structure and organization of exchange-traded funds, contrasting them with mutual funds, which are close relatives of exchange-traded funds, describing the differences in how ETFs operate and their potential advantages in terms of liquidity, lower expenses, tax efficiency, and transparency. We then turn to concerns over whether the rise in ETFs may raise unexpected risks for investors or greater instability in financial markets. While concerns over financial fragility are worth serious consideration, some of the common concerns are overstated, and for others, a number of rules and practices are already in place that offer a substantial margin of safety.","[Lettau, Martin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Madhavan, Ananth] Black Rock Inc, ETF & Index Investing Res, San Francisco, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",lettau@berkeley.edu; ananth.madhavan@berkeley.edu,"Lettau, Martin/P-4844-2018","Lettau, Martin/0000-0003-4049-4706",,,,,41,57,67,4,152,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Statistically speaking, the Fama-French three factor models imply that the return of an asset can be accounted for directly by the Fama-French three factors, i.e. market, size and value factor, through a linear function. A natural question is: would some kind of transformed Fama-French three factors work better? If so, what kind of transformation should be imposed on each factor in order to make the transformed three factors better account for asset returns? In this paper, we are going to address these questions through nonparametric modelling. We propose a data driven approach to construct the transformation for each factor concerned. A generalised maximum likelihood ratio based hypothesis test is also proposed to test whether transformations on the Fama-French three factors are needed for a given data set. Asymptotic properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to show how the proposed methods perform with finite sample size. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a real data set, which leads to some interesting findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analysed what developments are expected in precision medicine over the next decade and considered the implications for health technology assessment (HTA) agencies.MethodsWe performed a pragmatic literature search to account for the large size and wide scope of the precision medicine literature. We refined and enriched these results with a series of expert interviews up to 1h in length, including representatives from HTA agencies, research councils and researchers designed to cover a wide spectrum of precision medicine applications and research.ResultsWe identified 31 relevant papers and interviewed 13 experts. We found that three types of precision medicine are expected to emerge in clinical practice: complex algorithms, digital health applications and omics'-based tests. These are expected to impact upon each stage of the HTA process, from scoping and modelling through to decision-making and review. The complex and uncertain treatment pathways associated with patient stratification and fast-paced technological innovation are central to these effects.DiscussionInnovation in precision medicine promises substantial benefits but will change the way in which some health services are delivered and evaluated. The shelf life of guidance may decrease, structural uncertainty may increase and new equity considerations will emerge. As biomarker discovery accelerates and artificial intelligence-based technologies emerge, refinements to the methods and processes of evidence assessments will help to adapt and maintain the objective of investing in healthcare that is value for money.","[Love-Koh, James; Peel, Alison; Ennis, Kate; Wood, Hannah; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Love-Koh, James; Manca, Andrea] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos; Lovett, Rosemary] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ennis, Kate] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Manca, Andrea] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Chalkidou, Anastasia] Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, London, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of Liverpool; Luxembourg Institute of Health,"Love-Koh, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Love-Koh, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",james.love-koh@york.ac.uk,"owoyele, babajide/AAD-7054-2020; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/AFQ-4095-2022; Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023; Nasarian, Elham/ISB-6863-2023","owoyele, babajide/0000-0002-3688-5248; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-0680-7353; Ennis, Kate/0000-0003-4284-217X",NICE,NICE,This project was funded by NICE.,,78,63,65,6,26,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36,12,,,,,1439,1451,,10.1007/s40273-018-0686-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0686-6,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30003435,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000451183300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Existing research, however, does not typically consider methods that aim at theory generation. Current methods such as econometric modelling or structural equation modelling face challenges related to how causality is established due to potential issues regarding cross-sectional data sets. To address this gap, this paper suggests a total interpretive structural modelling based approach. We use graph theory logic to synthesize expert interpretations in the form of a theoretical supply chain model.

While the sale-to-rent ratio of housing prices is generally regarded as a fundamental barometer of housing market health, the study of its determinants remains in its infancy. This paper examines the housing price ratio in Ireland since 2000, a period including an extreme housing market cycle. Using new data on first-time buyer loan-to-value ratios, a one-step error correction model of the housing price ratio in Ireland is presented for the first time. It finds clear evidence that, alongside user cost, credit conditions were central in determining equilibrium in the housing market. Throughout, and especially earlier in the sample, there is rapid adjustment of the housing price ratio to its implied equilibrium relation. There is evidence that the housing market regime changed during the period, in 2010 and again in 2014/2015. The preferred specifications imply that a ten percentage point increase in the median first-time buyer loan-to-value was associated with a 9% rise in sale prices, holding other factors - including rental prices and the system wide ratio of credit to deposits - constant. In addition to an understanding of the Irish market, the findings contribute to the evidence base for macroprudential policies that focus on mortgage lending and also hint at how housing market history may differ across rising and falling markets in forming expectations of capital gains.","[Lyons, Ronan C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, Ronan C.] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lyons, RC (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.;Lyons, RC (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England.",ronan.lyons@tcd.ie,,"Lyons, Ronan/0000-0001-5342-987X",Balliol College Oxford,Balliol College Oxford,"I am very grateful to the editors and two anonymous referees for thorough comments which have substantially improved the analysis, to John Muellbauer for patient and diligent support as supervisor, to daft.ie and the Central Bank of Ireland for sharing data, and to Balliol College Oxford for financial support as a doctoral student that made this research possible.

SecurAcath is a catheter securement device designed for central venous catheters. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, as a part of its Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme, selected this device for evaluation and invited the manufacturer, Interrad Medical, to submit clinical and economic evidence. The King's Technology Evaluation Centre, an External Assessment Centre commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, independently critiqued the manufacturer's submissions. The External Assessment Centre found a lack of evidence comparing SecurAcath with alternative approaches to securement (StatLock, suturing, tape securement), with one unpublished randomised controlled trial providing the strongest evidence. The External Assessment Centre conducted a new systematic review and meta-analysis and concluded that there is some evidence indicating the non-inferiority of SecurAcath compared to StatLock. The External Assessment Centre considered the manufacturer's economic model to be appropriate but made revisions to some parameters and noted significant heterogeneity in the included studies. The revised model indicated that StatLock was more cost effective than SecurAcath for catheter indwell times of up to 5days; however, for medium- and long-term indwell times, SecurAcath was the most cost-effective option. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Medical Technologies Guidance MTG 34, issued in June 2017, recommended the adoption of SecurAcath for securing peripherally inserted central catheters within the National Health Service in England.","[Macmillan, Tom; Goddard, Kate; Herz, Naomi; Keevil, Stephen; Chalkidou, Anastasia] Kings Coll London, Sch Biomed Engn & Imaging Sci, Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, 5th Floor,Becket House,1 Lambeth Palace Rd, London SE1 7EU, England; [Pennington, Mark; Zala, Darshan] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, London, England; [Summers, Jennifer A.; Peacock, Janet L.] Kings Coll London, Sch Populat Hlth & Environm Sci, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London,"Macmillan, T (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Biomed Engn & Imaging Sci, Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, 5th Floor,Becket House,1 Lambeth Palace Rd, London SE1 7EU, England.",thomas.macmillan@kcl.ac.uk,"Pennington, Mark/AAS-9946-2020; Summers, Jennifer/JQW-6458-2023","Pennington, Mark/0000-0002-1392-8700; Summers, Jennifer/0000-0002-3156-0479; Peacock, Janet/0000-0002-0310-2518; Macmillan, Thomas/0000-0001-7274-797X",Wellcome/Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Medical Engineering [WT 203148/Z/16/Z]; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,Wellcome/Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Medical Engineering; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,"This work was supported by the Wellcome/Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Medical Engineering (WT 203148/Z/16/Z), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London.

The empirical results show that risk-induced vulnerability and heterogeneity in trade exposure matter in determining household overall vulnerability and that this is not linked to the actual manifestation of shocks. Although it does not represent, by any means, an argument against free trade, this work is relevant for policymaking since it contributes to deepen our knowledge on the subtle links between trade openness and vulnerability and informs us about suitable instruments to accompany it.

What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future.","[Mankiw, N.

Alongside this, an academic debate has unfolded regarding how PES ought to be conceptualized and defined. Using the first survey of environmental professionals on this topic, we explore their position in this conceptual debate in the UK. Our study shows that all aspects of the key academic debates are reflected in the views of environmental professionals, whose range of understandings suggests no viewpoint is either dominant or uncontested. Expecting all to share a single 'perfect' definition of PES may be neither necessary nor feasible. However, at present this term invokes a very wide range of ideas that may generate frictions as PES are further implemented. This risks PES becoming a 'mess' from which few insights can be derived as to whether, when and why they are useful instruments. It essential that those debating and proposing PES concepts more closely consider the complex processes by which professionals engage with and shape its application as an abstract construct.","[Martin-Ortega, Julia] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Waylen, Kerry A.] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",University of Leeds; James Hutton Institute,"Martin-Ortega, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.martinortega@leeds.ac.uk,"Waylen, Kerry/B-1867-2008","Waylen, Kerry/0000-0002-6593-2795",Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021; 'Shut up and Write' writing club of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds,Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021; 'Shut up and Write' writing club of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds,"This research was co-funded by the Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021 and water@leeds, the interdisciplinary centre for water research of the University of Leeds.

This question, fundamental to travel demand management and land-use planning, has only been partially addressed in the literature so far. The impacts on travel to the destination concerned have been studied, but not the impacts on wider travel behaviour. This paper reports on a natural experiment related to destination parking, where a university removed the right of most undergraduates living off-campus to park on its main suburban campus. A survey was conducted to compare the travel behaviours of two groups of undergraduate students: the first group started before and the second group started after the introduction of the parking restriction (n = 858). The survey captured licence,holding, c.ar. availability. during the term and vacation periods, and the mode of-transport used to travel to campus and for the last trip to another location. The parking restriction was associated with a fall in the modal share of driving to campus of nine percentage points. Car availability during term-time fell by 14 percentage points and licence-holding fell by nine percentage points. The policy change was associated with greater changes amongst females than males. Overall, the results suggest that removing the right of young adults to park at a frequent destination delayed their acquisition of driving licences and cars. These findings may explain part of the fall in licence-holding observed amongst young adults in Great Britain in recent decades.","[Melia, Steve; Clark, Ben] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Melia, S (通讯作者)，Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS13 1QY, Avon, England.",steve.melia@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,9,10,2,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

One of the explanations advanced for these declines is the urbanisation of young adults, their growing concentration in the denser areas of larger cities. This study analyses the changing spatial patterns and travel behaviour of young adults over time using a complete national dataset for England between 2001 and 2011. It uses a fractional response model to analyse the changing relationship between the proportion of young adults driving to work, and using public transport to get to work, and population density and settlement size. It finds that urbanisation contributed to less driving and more public transport use amongst young adults aged 1634. These changes followed a change in national planning policy which encouraged higher density development in urban areas. These policies caused a re-urbanisation of the population as a whole, with the strongest trends amongst young adults. The re-urbanisation of the population was accompanied by a widening of the differentials in travel behaviour between those in the densest areas and the largest settlements (who drove less) and the rest. These findings cast new light on the controversy over residential self-selection. They suggest that a change in planning policy probably caused a modest national fall in driving. Residential self-selection, which is often considered a barrier to such policies, facilitated those outcomes.","[Melia, Steve; Chatterjee, Kiron] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Stokes, Gordon] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England",University of West England; University of Oxford,"Melia, S (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",steve.melia@uwe.ac.uk,,,UK Department for Transport,UK Department for Transport,"The research reported in this paper was largely carried out as part of the 'Young People's Travel Behaviour' project which was commissioned and funded by the UK Department for Transport.

Recent contributions to Work, employment and society have highlighted challenges for engaged research. Based on the emancipatory epistemologies of Bourdieu, Gramsci and Burawoy, the authors examine moral challenges in workplace fieldwork, question the assumptions of mainstream ethics discourses and seek to identify an alternative approach. Instead of an ethics premised on a priori, universal precepts that treasure academic neutrality, this article recognises a morality that responds to the social context of research with participation and commitment. The reflection in this study is based on fieldwork conducted in the former Soviet Union. Transformation societies present challenges to participatory ethnography but simultaneously provide considerable opportunities for developing an ethics of truth. An approach that can guide engaged researchers through social conflict's 'messy' reality should hinge on loyalty to the emancipation struggles of those engaged in it.","[Morrison, Claudio] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London, England; [Sacchetto, Devi] Univ Padua, Sociol Work, Padua, Italy",Middlesex University; University of Padua,"Morrison, C (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England.",c.morrison@mdx.ac.uk,,"Sacchetto, Devi/0000-0002-3087-680X",,,,,44,4,4,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This article argues that occupational change is also shaped by labour supply - particularly education and immigration - and institutions. Polarisation therefore represents just one scenario of occupational change. Our study of Ireland and Switzerland examines long-term change in the employment structure (1970-2010), using census data and an encompassing definition of the labour force. Results show no simple trend of occupational upgrading morphing into polarisation. Occupational upgrading occurred in both countries, with the largest employment gains in high-paid occupations and the largest losses in low-paid ones. Patterns of occupational change largely aligned with the evolution of labour supply, upgrading in the 1990s and 2000s being driven in both countries by higher educated women. Immigration supplied labour for low-end and mid-level jobs in Ireland during the Celtic Tiger era, and for low-paid occupations in Switzerland during the 1980s.","[Murphy, Emily C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance SKOPE, Oxford, England; [Oesch, Daniel] Univ Lausanne, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Oxford; University of Lausanne,"Oesch, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, LIVES Swiss Natl Ctr Competence Res, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.oesch@unil.ch,"Daniel, Oesch/C-2243-2016","Daniel, Oesch/0000-0003-1704-853X; Murphy, Emily C./0000-0003-3063-455X",Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research 'LIVES - Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives' - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-160590],Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research 'LIVES - Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives' - Swiss National Science Foundation,"Data used in this article were made available by the Swiss Federal Statistics Office, the Central Statistics Office Ireland, the Irish Social Science Data Archive, and the Minnesota Population Center, none of whom bear any responsibility for the analysis or interpretation of the data reported here.

This paper argues that the control and capture of water resources are not solely for economic development but rather for geopolitical reasons that serve the security interests of the actors involved, particularly outside-basin powers like the US and India. The Afghan Government similarly views dams as symbols of nation-building and a way of staying in power. In the absence of a lasting trilateral agreement, the existing nature of the geopolitical dynamics of the basin has led upstream Afghanistan and downstream Iran and Turkmenistan to unilaterally establish their rights to control the rules of the game. This paper suggests that sustainable solutions will not be reached unless the geopolitical nature of the basin and outside interventions can center on a normative understanding of the regional interests, identities, and commonalities of all the riparian states.","[Nagheeby, Mohsen] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Warner, Jeroen] Wageningen Univ, Disaster Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Northumbria University; Wageningen University & Research,"Nagheeby, M (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",mohsen.nagheeby@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,22,28,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Private and public R&D spending across three competing, yet complementary inputs - Labor, Capital, and Resources - follow a portfolio allocation decision, where inputs with relatively higher growth in costs, see higher R&D investment and productivity gains. Two policy experiments are reported; a market-based Resource tax increase, and a centralized green policy, where public R&D budget is shifted towards Resource-saving technologies. We highlight that in the presence of labor market institutions, which give rise to hysteresis, and limited R&D budgets, a policy of continuous Resource tax growth is needed to induce Resource-saving technological change to achieve a greener economy. This needs to be coupled with planned government spending adjustment to spur demand and boost investment. The findings also suggest that a mix of market-based and centralized policies may be optimal.","[Naqvi, Asjad] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Naqvi, Asjad] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Stockhammer, Engelbert] Kings Coll London, London, England",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of London; King's College London,"Naqvi, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria.;Naqvi, A (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",snaqvi@wu.ac.at,"Naqvi, Asjad/AAE-2793-2019; Naqvi, Asjad/AAP-5034-2021; Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535; Naqvi, Asjad/0000-0002-0986-6009",Austrian Central Bank (Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB)) Anniversary Fund [17400],Austrian Central Bank (Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB)) Anniversary Fund,We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Our findings suggest that US monetary policy has experienced substantial changes in terms of both the response to inflation and to real economic activity, as well as changes in preferences. These changes cannot be captured adequately by a single structural break at the late 1970s, as has been commonly assumed in the literature, and play a non-trivial role in economic performance.","[Nguyen, Anh D.

Despite economic improvements in the second decade of transition, research has documented that happiness lagged behind. We test whether past unemployment experience can explain this transition happiness gap in the context of Ukraine, a country with a painful delayed transition from planned to market economy. We analyze unique longitudinal data for the period 2003-2012. Current unemployment substantially reduces subjective wellbeing, and the effect is roughly 50% larger for men than for women. The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment. However, it does correspond to around 8% of the transition happiness gap found by Guriev and Melnikov (2017), suggesting that past unemployment experience can be considered as a partial explanation.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nizalova, Olena] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Nizalova, Olena] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Nizalova, Olena] GLO, Rostock, Germany; [Murtazashvili, Irina] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Kent; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Drexel University,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631; Nizalova, Olena/0000-0002-1704-2632",European Union [649496]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649496] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This project has been partially supported with funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 649496.,,20,0,0,1,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

However, little is known about the actual underlying risk to the fiscal sector just after such events. In this paper, we estimate the risk of fiscal shortages due to tropical storms in the Caribbean. To this end, first we use a panel VAR and estimate that while government expenditure does not respond to damages due to tropical storms, there is a significant contemporaneous effect on fiscal revenue. The results also reveal that different components of expenditure and revenue respond differently to hurricane shocks. Then, employing a parametric bulk extreme value model on estimated losses due to historical events, we show that the fiscal shortage due to storms can potentially be sizeable depending on the rarity of the event, but varies considerably across islands. However, any risk assessment is fraught with considerable uncertainty, particularly for rare but potentially very damaging tropical storm strikes.","[Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Strobl, Eric] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Vermeiren, Jan] Kinet Anal Corp, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Yearwood, Stacia] Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facil, St Michael, Barbados",University of Manchester; University of Bern,"Ouattara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",osman.ouattara-2@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

They try to achieve a wide range of socio-economic and environmental effects through bundles of interventions that include the process of standard setting and compliance, advocacy among consumers, capacity building for producers, building supply chains, price interventions, and the application of acceptable labour standards, overall to improve the wellbeing of farmers and agricultural workers. This paper presents the results of a mixed-method systematic review that synthesized the literature on socio-economic effects of certification systems on agricultural producers and wage workers in low and middle income countries. The review followed the Campbell Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews, and included studies published between 1990 and 2016 in different languages, with evidence on low and middle income countries. The review included a quantitative effectiveness question focused on a range of intermediate (e.g. prices, wages) and endpoint outcomes (e.g. household income). It also included a question on barriers, facilitators and contextual factors shaping effectiveness which drew on qualitative or mixed-method studies. Eligible certification systems were based on second (industry-level) or third-party certifications, and excluded own-company standards. For the effectiveness review, quantitative impact evaluations must use experimental or non-experimental methods demonstrating control for selection bias. With these inclusion criteria, the review includes 43 studies used for analysing quantitative effects, and 136 qualitative studies for synthesizing barriers, enablers and other contextual factors. Most included studies report on initiatives in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa and focus primarily on agricultural producers. The quality of the included studies is mixed, and several studies are weak on a number of methodological fronts, especially on statistical reporting. Overall, there is limited and mixed evidence on the effects of CS on a range of intermediate and final socio-economic outcomes for agricultural producers and wage workers. There are positive effects on prices and income from the sale of produce is higher for certified farmers. However, workers' wages do not seem to benefit from the presence of CS and, further along the causal chain, we find no evidence that total household income improves with certification. The integrated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies shows that context matters substantially in all causal chains and multiple factors shape the effectiveness and causal mechanisms that link interventions associated with certification and the wellbeing of producers, workers and their families.

Experts' involvement can be as intensive as being a member of a committee and thus having direct influence on recommendations or limited one-off consultations on specific parameters. We identified 16 tools for expert elicitation that were potentially relevant. None fully met the requirements of NICE, although an existing tool could be potentially adapted. Ongoing research to develop a reference protocol for expert elicitation in healthcare decision making may be of use in future.ConclusionsNICE uses expert judgement across all its guidance-making programmes, but its uses vary considerably. There is no currently available tool for expert elicitation suitable for use by NICE. However, adaptation of an existing tool or ongoing research in the area could address this in the future.","[Peel, Alison; Jenks, Michelle; Craig, Joyce] York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Choudhury, Moni; Lovett, Rosemary] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, London, England; [Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sims, Andrew] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Freeman Hosp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Sims, Andrew] Newcastle Univ, Inst Cellular Med, Fac Med Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of York - UK; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Newcastle Freeman Hospital; Newcastle University - UK,"Peel, A (通讯作者)，York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York, N Yorkshire, England.",alison.peel@york.ac.uk,"Sims, Andrew/AAT-8027-2021; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/AFQ-4095-2022","Sims, Andrew/0000-0002-9553-7278; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-0680-7353",NICE,NICE,"Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and York Health Economics Consortium are funded by NICE to support the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme as an External Assessment Centre (EAC).

For the optimal forecast combination, SDE will minimize the cumulative density functions of the levels of loss at different quantiles of the forecast error distribution by combining different time-series model-based forecasts. Using two exchange rate series on weekly data for the Japanese yen/US dollar and US dollar/Great Britain pound, we find that the optimal forecast combinations with SDE weights perform better than different forecast selection and combination methods for the majority of the cases at different quantiles of the error distribution. However, there are also some very few cases where some other forecast selection and combination model performs equally well at some quantiles of the forecast error distribution. Different forecasting period and quadratic loss function are used to obtain optimal forecast combinations, and results are robust to these choices. The out-of-sample performance of the SDE forecast combinations is also better than that of the other forecast selection and combination models we considered.","[Pinar, Mehmet] Edge Hill Univ, Business Sch, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, Lancs, England; [Stengos, Thanasis] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Yazgan, M.

This 70 MW project covers more than 63 ha of the flooded area and can provide electricity for 21,000 homes. It also demonstrates China's ambition to amend its fragile environmental status namely air pollution, which claims 1.6 million lives every year. Soon after the completion, many countries expressed interest in building similar power stations, and within few months some companies released innovative products tailored specifically for improving the efficiency of floating solar power plants. China has a unique capacity to implement new ideas, scale them up and commercialise efficiently and now its self-declared war on pollution in 2014 seems to be reshaping the world energy landscape. China's plan to build 1 GW floating solar farms on abandoned coal mines present a stark contrast to the current environmental policies of the government of the United States.

We study a model of electoral competition with rationally ignorant voters in which the success of a reform is tied to a politician's unobservable competence. We show that when voters' demand for reform is high, candidates engage in a form of populism and propose reformist agendas regardless of their ability to successfully carry them out. As voters are then faced with either risky reformers or policy inaction, the relationship between demand for reform and the probability that any (i.e., genuine or populist) policy change is implemented depends on how harmful botched reforms are. Our results help organize the mixed empirical evidence regarding the impact of crises on the likelihood of reform.

Poorer, rural and smaller households as well as those with older adults and individuals with chronic conditions had greater odds of facing CHE. According to the estimates from the adjusted regression model, healthcare services could be grouped into three groups. Medical tests, surgery and medication were in the first group with odds ratios (ORs) between 6.43 and 4.72. Hospitalisation, outpatient, dental and eye care were in the second group with ORs between 2.61 and 1.46. Child care, maternity care and other healthcare services (such as contraceptives, rehabilitation, etc.) were in the third group with non-significant ORs. Many Peruvian households are forced to finance their healthcare through OOP payments, burdening their finances to the extent of affecting their living standards.","[Proano Falconi, Diego; Bernabe, Eduardo] Kings Coll London, Dent Inst Guys, Div Populat & Patient Hlth, Kings Coll, Denmark Hill Campus,Bessemer Rd, London SE5 9RS, England; [Proano Falconi, Diego; Bernabe, Eduardo] St Thomas Hosp, Denmark Hill Campus,Bessemer Rd, London SE5 9RS, England; [Proano Falconi, Diego] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Estomatol, Dept Acad Odontol Social, Lima, Peru",University of London; King's College London; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia,"Bernabé, E (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dent Inst Guys, Div Populat & Patient Hlth, Kings Coll, Denmark Hill Campus,Bessemer Rd, London SE5 9RS, England.;Bernabé, E (通讯作者)，St Thomas Hosp, Denmark Hill Campus,Bessemer Rd, London SE5 9RS, England.",eduardo.bernabe@kcl.ac.uk,"Bernabe, Eduardo/R-3441-2017; Falconi, Diego José Proaño/ACQ-1274-2022; Bernabe, Eduardo/HTT-3966-2023","Bernabe, Eduardo/0000-0002-1858-3713; Falconi, Diego José Proaño/0000-0002-7836-2656;",,,,,33,17,23,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

It examines whether there are differences in the effect according to business location - rural or urban, the agricultural supply chain and according to CAP Pillars. A microeconomic approach is employed, based on firm data from FAME dataset combined with detailed subsidies information from Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The generalised method of moments (system GMM) is used to estimate the effect of CAP payments in both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although the magnitude of the effect is small, it is economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect relative to Pillar 2. However, Pillar 2 payments have a stronger positive effect per Euro spent in rural areas and within agricultural supply chain.","[Rizov, Marian] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England; [Davidova, Sophia; Bailey, Alastair] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Lincoln; University of Kent,"Rizov, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Business Sch, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",mrizov@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Bailey, Alastair/0000-0002-4682-3251; Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980",,,,,41,12,14,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

The novelty of the paper resides in the use of a VAR-IRF that encompasses previous hysteresis studies, using long-term unemployment, productivity, capital stock and real long-term interest rates, and in the use of specific Labour Market Institutions shocks, such as benefits, taxation or unions' power. This allows us to disentangle what specific demand and supply-variables affect unemployment in the long-run, i.e. the NAIRU. Our findings suggest that there is hysteresis in both countries, and that it happens through several channels. Further, we find that the influence of Labour Market Institutions on unemployment depend on their impact on the real wages-productivity gap. These results have implications for structural and macroeconomic policies that we also discuss. Finally, we investigate the impact of different supply and demand-shock on long-term unemployment and discuss the relevant policy implications.","[Rodriguez-Gil, Antonio] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Rodriguez-Gil, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.rodriguezgil@leeds.ac.uk,"Gil, Antonio rodriguez/C-1392-2013","Rodriguez Gil, Antonio/0000-0002-3414-4438",,,,,63,3,3,1,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It argues that existing 'demand-side' approaches focused on promoting technological efficiency and informed individual consumption are unlikely to be adequate to achieving future carbon emissions reduction goals; it points out that very little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of non-energy policies on energy demand; and it submits that a much fuller integration of energy demand questions into policy is required. It advances a general framework, supported by illustrative examples, for understanding the impacts of 'non-energy' policies on energy demand. It reflects on why these connections have been so little explored and addressed within energy research and policy. And it argues that, for all their current 'invisibility', there is nonetheless scope for increasing the visibility of, and in effect 'mainstreaming', energy demand reduction objectives within other policy areas. Researchers and policymakers, we contend, need to develop better understandings of how energy demand might be made governable, and how non-energy policies might be revised, alone and in combination, to help steer long-term changes in energy demand.","[Royston, Sarah; Selby, Jan] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Shove, Elizabeth] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Sussex; Lancaster University,"Royston, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",s.royston@sussex.ac.uk; j.selby@sussex.ac.uk; e.shove@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Selby, Jan/0000-0002-7574-9660","DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Research Councils UK Energy Programme [EP/K011723/1]; EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI","DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Research Councils UK Energy Programme; EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by the DEMAND: Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand Research Centre funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/K011723/1] as part of the Research Councils UK Energy Programme and by EDF as part of the R&D ECLEER Programme.",,108,63,67,7,53,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123,,,,,,127,135,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.052,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000453499700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also find public banks generate positive spillovers for private banks. Our counterfactual study shows that privatization substantially reduces the number of banks.

This paper looks to understand how the breadth and depth of participation of different types of actors, most particularly civil society, compares between these initiatives and in what ways the structure of the governance arrangement and/or the focus of commodities may influence this participation. The paper presents findings from an assessment study on the dynamics of participation of civil society actors in REDD + and FLEGT processes in four countries of Central and Western Africa: Cameroon, Ghana, Liberia and the Republic of Congo. Building on key civil society participation literature, a questionnaire tool was developed and applied in these countries. The analysis is drawn from interviews based on the questionnaire tool, some in-depth interviews and secondary research. The study finds that there is a growing recognition of civil society participation in national policy making of forest governance in the four countries, and a majority of the civil society organisations are participating in REDD+ and FLEGT processes. The quality and degree of their participation (that can range from informing to empowering) however, varies between FLEGT and REDD+ (i.e. FLEGT being more accommodative than REDD+), among a diversity of these actors and the studied countries. The difference in participation between REDD+ and FLEGT is related to the design of these two processes, the general lack of time and financial investment and the technical nature of REDD+ consultations. Moreover, FLEGT has been more inclusive and participatory right from the beginning whereas participatory spaces are generally lacking in REDD+ process, most particularly in its initial stages. As REDD+ and FLEGT processes are being consolidated in these countries and worldwide, this paper provides several avenues of interventions needed to address gaps on participation, such as strengthening participatory platforms, addressing representation deficit for community groups and focusing on capacity building of civil society actors.","[Satyal, Poshendra] Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Satyal, P (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Global Environm Justice Grp, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.satyal@uea.ac.uk,,"Satyal, Poshendra/0000-0003-3503-5011",European Union; University of East Anglia,European Union(European Union (EU)); University of East Anglia,"Financial assistance for this study was provided through a grant from the European Union and the University of East Anglia.

We construct an econometric model that matches fraud alert data from the European Union (EU) Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) from 2006 to 2016 with annual data on bilateral trade flows. We find that-prior to the horsemeat scandal-detection of fraud along the supply chain induced a small amount of trade diversion toward third-country sources, but did not substantially affect total trade into the EU. In contrast, in the years after the scandal, the detection of fraud by international suppliers was substantially trade destructive. Detection of fraud reduced trade, not only with the country from which the fraudulent product originated, but also from third-country exporters of the same product. These findings extend beyond trade in meat products and to importing countries outside Western and Northern Europe.","[Schaefer, K.

Yet most remain controversial owing to inter alia the arbitrary selection of component weights. Several studies have proposed testing the robustness of rankings generated by composite indices with respect to alternative weights but have not provided sufficient guidance on the choice of these alternatives. This paper proposes a holistic yet theoretically novel approach for selecting sets of alternative weights and assessing comparison robustness that is applicable to linear composite indices with any finite number of dimensions. Our approach is founded on the main normative assumption that a consensus has been reached on the minimum and the maximum allowable weights that should be assigned to the components. This approach is applied to robustness testing of inter-temporal country improvements generated by arguably the world's most influential composite development index, the UNDP Human Development Index.","[Seth, Suman] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Seth, Suman; McGillivray, Mark] Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Oxford, England; [McGillivray, Mark] Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Inst, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",University of Leeds; University of Oxford; Deakin University,"Seth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Seth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Oxford, England.",S.Seth@leeds.ac.uk; Mark.McGillivray@deakin.edu.au,"Seth, Suman/ABE-1498-2020","McGillivray, Mark/0000-0002-6461-2706; Seth, Suman/0000-0002-2591-6977",,,,,24,18,18,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2018,51,4,,,,,657,679,,10.1007/s00355-018-1132-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00355-018-1132-6,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HA3NH,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000450158800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Related concerns have been expressed about the persistence of low pay, the fragmentation of work and the growth of under-employment. While all these factors have potential implications for individuals' earnings, less is known about the connection between labour market change, patterns of sectoral growth and decline, and household poverty outcomes. This article shows distinct patterns of poverty outcomes by sector of employment, after controlling for other factors. However, household characteristics, in particular the presence of a second earner, do strongly mitigate the poverty risk.

The Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) in Sri Lanka was an exemplary renewable energy access program, successfully installing 21,000 off-grid SHSs alongside grid-connected mini-hydro capacity and off-grid village hydroelectric systems. It reached all of its targets ahead of schedule and below cost. By contrast, the Indonesia Solar Home System Project (ISHSP), which ran from 1997 to 2003, sought to reach one million rural Indonesians through the sales and installation of 200,000 SHSs. However, by project closing in 2003, less than five percent of the original sales target, or only 8054 units, had been installed. The ESDP and ISHSP were the World Bank's first foray into a market-based renewable energy services provision model. Based on original research interviews and field observation, the article finds that contrasting the two programs one a success, the other a failure offers lessons for energy and development practitioners, namely that effective programs are those that select appropriate technology, often with input from households themselves; they promote community participation and ownership; and they have robust marketing, demonstration, and promotion activities.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aarhus University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",National University of Singapore [09-273]; John D. and Catherine T.

Despite increasing societal interest in transitions to more sustainable transportation technologies, there has been little consideration of how such innovations might challenge, maintain or support different aspects of automobility, and what that means for technology deployment, transport policy, and user practices. To bring attention to the complexity and apparent durability of the automobility system, in this paper we develop a conceptual framework that explores automobility through a categorization of frames, or shared cultural meanings. This framework moves beyond the typical focus on private, functional considerations of user choice, financial costs and time use to also consider symbolic and societal frames of automobility that exist among users, non-users, industry, policymakers and other relevant social groups. We illustrate this framework with eight particular frames of automobility that fall into four broad categories: private-functional frames such as (1) cocooning and fortressing and (2) mobile digital offices; private-symbolic frames such as (3) gender identity and (4) social status; societal-functional frames such as (5) environmental stewardship and (6) sub urbanization; and societal-symbolic frames such as (7) self-sufficiency and (8) innovativeness. Finally, we start the process of discussing several transportation innovations in light of these automobility frames, namely electrified, autonomous and shared mobility examining early evidence for which frames would be challenged or supported by such transitions. We believe that appreciation of the complex and varied frames of automobility can enrich discussion of transitions and policy relating to sustainable transportation.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Axsen, Jonn] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Aarhus University; University of Sussex; Simon Fraser University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"One of the intellectual architects of this manuscript, Professor John Urry, sadly passed away in March 2016 as a second draft was being written.

This paper adds to the conversation by investigating the impact of bank distress on firms' exports using matched firm-bank data for the UK. We use two novel measures of bank distress: the Basel III net stable funding ratio, as well as the market-based bank credit default swap spreads, which best capture bank default risk, especially during crises. Our detailed database provides the crucial firm bank relationship information that allows us to directly test for the banking channel effect on the real economy, and to carefully account for various endogeneities and biases in estimation. We also test for the possible contagion of the Sovereign Debt Crisis from the GIIPS economies to the UK. We find that the severe bank distress generated by the recent crises immediately, negatively and significantly affects UK firms' exports, independent of demand shocks. Not all firms were impacted equally: private firms and firms in industries more dependent on external finance were impacted the most, while publicly owned firms were less affected by their bank's distress.

Current estimates indicate that climate change will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the twenty-first century. In fact, the initial impacts of climate change may well be positive. However, in the long run the negative impacts dominate the positive ones. Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer, hotter, and lower-lying countries. Poverty reduction complements greenhouse gas emissions reduction as a means to reduce climate change impacts. Although climate change may affect the growth rate of the global economy and may trap more people in poverty, quantification of these impacts remains difficult. The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon.","[Tol, Richard S.

This policy brief examines the implications. The UK is a large importer of emission permits. Thus, meeting its climate policy targets would be much more difficult without the EU ETS, costing an additional 0.2 to 0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to the increased compliance costs, the UK will face transition costs for leaving the EU ETS because a central plank of UK climate policy (i.e., permit trade) will need to be replaced on short notice. Furthermore, there may be a loss of business as the carbon trade leaves London. Moreover, as UK greenhouse gas regulation diverges from the EU, distortions at the border will also increase. The impact of a UK departure from the EU ETS on the EU would be limited if the EU accepts a weaker emissions cap. Non-EU countries such as Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein participate in the EU ETS, and this would appear to be the best option for the UK if it leaves the EU.","[Tol, Richard S.

Focusing on Jordan, an Arab country where gender inequality and emigration rates are high, this paper exploits unique data in which detailed information on female empowerment allows us to construct several measures of social norms in Jordan on the role of women, female freedom of mobility, and female decision-making power. Controlling for both emigration and return migration selections, we find that women with a returnee family member are more likely to bear traditional gender norms than women in households with no migration experience. Further analysis shows that results are driven by returnees from more conservative Arab countries, suggesting a transfer of conservative norms from destinations with highly traditional gender roles.

This illustrates that, in the rural regions under study, one's caste is still an important determinant of opportunities in life. Subsequently, we find that the castes at the top are clearly more satisfied than the lower and middle castes. This result, which is in line with the predictions of all major social comparison theories, is robust across the two case studies. The pattern across low and middle castes, however, is less clear, reflecting the complex theoretical relationship between being of middle rank, on the one hand, and behaviour, aspirations, and well-being, on the other hand. In the Punjab sample, we even find a significant U-shaped pattern, with the middle castes being the least happy. Interestingly, these patterns resemble those found for Olympic medallists (first documented by Medvec et al., 1995).","[Van Landeghem, Bert] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Van Landeghem, Bert] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Van Landeghem, Bert] Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Vandeplas, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Vandeplas, Anneleen] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",University of Sheffield; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; KU Leuven,"Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Van Landeghem, B (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany.",b.vanlandeghem@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Vandeplas, Anneleen/0000-0001-7629-578X",,,,,82,5,6,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

This method has been increasingly applied in the energy domain to collect information on the future cost, technical performance, and associated uncertainty of specific energy technologies. This article has two main objectives: (1) to introduce the basics of expert elicitations, including their design and implementation, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and their potential to inform policymaking and energy system decisions; and (2) to discuss and compare the results of a subset of the most recent expert elicitations on energy technologies, with a focus on future cost trajectories and implied cost reduction rates. We argue that the data on future energy costs provided by expert elicitations allows for more transparent and robust analyses that incorporate technical uncertainty, which can then be used to support the design and assessment of energy and climate change mitigation policies.","[Verdolini, Elena; Bosetti, Valentina; Reis, Lara Aleluia] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena; Bosetti, Valentina; Reis, Lara Aleluia] Fdn CMCC, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Milan, Italy; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Baker, Erin] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, ELab 219, 160 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Ettore Bocconi Dept Econ, Room 5-D1-01,Via Roentgen,1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Cambridge; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Bocconi University,"Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，Fdn CMCC, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Milan, Italy.",elena.verdolini@feem.it; lda24@cam.ac.uk; edbaker@ecs.umass.edu; valentina.bosetti@unibocconi.it; lara.aleluia@feem.it,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930; Aleluia Reis, Lara/0000-0002-6676-7007",ERC [336703 - RISICO]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730403 - INNOPATHS],ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"The authors would like to thank the editor and the managing editor for their extensive support and three anonymous referees for excellent comments that helped to improve the article significantly.

The development of HSR service network in megaregions can change accessibility landscapes and create advantaged and disadvantaged cities. This study investigates how HSR service development has restructured uneven regional accessibility by developing a new regional accessibility measurement to incorporate train-service-frequency-into-the-prevailing-speed-dominated-calculations. We-conduct-a-longitudinal-study-to-examine the changing patterns and relevant determinants of regional accessibility in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, as well as the differences between conventional rail (CR) cities and HSR cities. The results indicate that the development of HSR services network has enhanced regional accessibility in the YRD rather than having the overall effect of restructuring the existing accessibility patterns formed by CR services. It has reduced the disparity of regional accessibility but has widened the gap between HSR and CR cities and increased the disparity of CR cities. Combined with a Tobit regression analysis, the results suggest that HSR network development in the YRD was highly spatially selective towards the cities that had higher CR network accessibility and better economic development performance. However, the disadvantage of regional accessibility for CR cities remains persistent, which may result in the issue of 'peripheralisation of the periphery'. Some policy implications for an integration of the CR and HSR services for both CR and HSR cities are outlined in conclusion.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China [41601169, 41871119]",Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester and National Science Foundation of China (41601169 and 41871119).

However, energy polices aiming at energy savings may not be as good as expected due to the existence of rebound effects. The motivation of the paper is to analysis the nexus between technical progress and energy rebound effects. Based on a three-input trans-log cost function model, we first estimate the share equation and the corresponding price elasticity for each input factor. Then, the rebound effect in China's iron & steel industry over 1985-2015 is evaluated through decomposing the energy prices. Empirical results show that: (1) The price elasticities of input factors are negative; (2) Energy/capital and energy/labor show substitute relationships; (3) The average energy rebound effect in the ISI is as high as 73.88%; (4) The energy rebound effect shows a downward trend before the 11th Five-year period and then an upward trend after that. Therefore, policies proposals of lowering the rebound effect should be placed not only on technical progress, but also on energy price reform by reducing energy subsidies and thus accelerating energy price marketization, so as to promote energy substitution, reduce energy rebound effect and produce further economic and environmental benefits.","[Wang, Xiaolei; Wen, Xiaohui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",China University of Mining & Technology; University of Birmingham,"Xie, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,"wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016","wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341; Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology [2017QNB03],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology,The paper is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology (No. 2017QNB03).,,46,31,32,2,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123,,,,,,259,265,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.016,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000453499700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such models provide a description of not only transient change and 'steady' behaviour, but also represent additional variability that occurs through prob-abilistic descriptions. They are therefore highly suited to modelling both the disturbance and subsequent 'drift' of networks that are subject to some systematic change, be that a road closure or capacity reduction, new policy measure or general change in demand patterns. In this paper we derive analytic results to probabilistically capture the nature of the transient effects following such a systematic change. This can be thought of as understanding what happens as a system moves from varying about one equilibrium state to varying about a new equilibrium state. The results capture analytically the changes over time in descriptors of the system, in terms of link flow means, variances and covariances. Formally, the analytic results hold asymptotically as approximations, as we imagine demand increasing in tandem with capacities; however, our interest is in general cases where such tandem increases do not occur, and so we provide conditions under which our approximations are likely to work well. Numerical results of applying the methods are reported on several examples. The quality of the approximations is assessed through comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations from the true underlying process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings highlight how flexible scheduling has serious consequences for workers and causes insecurity. This provides managers with a powerful and unaccountable mechanism for securing control. The benefits for managers of using flexible scheduling to secure control are shown to be its ambiguity and flexibility. Moreover, flexible scheduling creates an environment where workers must continually strive to maintain managers' favour. Little evidence is found to suggest that this control is aided by work games obscuring workplace relations. Flexible scheduling does, however, enable misrecognition of workplace relations due to the schedule gifts which it entails. Schedule gifts act to bind workers to managers' interests through feelings of gratitude and moral obligation.","[Wood, Alex J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England",University of Oxford,"Wood, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",alex.wood@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Wood, Alex/0000-0003-0569-7145","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I017011/1, ES/I901957/1]; ESRC [ES/I901957/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (grant numbers ES/I017011/1 and ES/I901957/1).,,40,35,41,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Especially in China, where the demands for transportation are tremendous and ever-increasing, it is worthy to explore the provincial variations in energy efficiency in the transport sector, in order to enhance energy efficiency and to promote energy savings in this sector. By using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach, this paper calculates the provincial energy efficiency as well as energy saving potential in China's provincial transport sector over 2007-2016. Results suggest that China's national average energy input efficiency in the transport industry is 0.673 during the sample period, which implied that relatively large degree of non-efficiency exists in this sector. Besides, the increase of government support (GS), the improvement of road condition (RC) and public transport (PT) are influencing factors for the improvement of China's provincial energy efficiency in the transport industry. Additionally, energy saving potential in the transport sector is also estimated in this paper. It is shown that, although energy efficiency in the eastern China is the highest (much higher than the country-wide level), the estimated absolute amount of the energy saving potential in the eastern area is significantly larger than those in the central area and western area due to the fact that the eastern area contributes to the largest share of the total energy consumption in this sector.","[Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bai, Mengqi] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nucl Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Wang, Xiaolei] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; China University of Mining & Technology,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaoleiwang@cumt.edu.cn,"wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022; Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016","wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341; Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180664],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),The paper is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no.

The results show that households from villages that reported use of village clinics are more likely to be insured compared with households from villages that reported use of county hospitals. The results indicate that the perception of quality of care is an important factor affecting people's enrolment decisions. The NRCMS is expected to help patients obtain better quality health services from higher tier of the healthcare system that are unaffordable otherwise.

We aim to assess the empirical performance of success functions for draws and analyze the differences between European soccer leagues in terms of home bias, return on talent (ROT), and talent inequality. We use a data set with 10,569 matches acquired manually from containing club-based average market values of the lineup of teams for each match played through 12 seasons from 7 major European soccer leagues. The results are obtained estimating the parameters of the success functions with a general maximum-likelihood method, and the hypotheses suggested by success functions are controlled with a probit regression. Two of the success functions outperform one conclusively. The difference in the performance between these two groups results from the contrast in the main determinant of the success function in allocating the probability of a draw. The high-performing success functions take difference in aggregate talent levels as the main determinant in drawing, while the other takes the aggregate talent as the main determinant. The results also show that there are major differences across leagues in terms of ROT, home bias, and talent inequality, despite the similarities in economic environment and the homogeneity in the rules of the game imposed across leagues. Our analysis sheds light on the contributions and implications of microeconomic theory to model sports and presents the differing characteristics of the European soccer leagues that impact match results significantly.","[Yildizparlak, Anil] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Yildizparlak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",anil.yildizparlak@durham.ac.uk,,"Yildizparlak, Anil/0000-0002-7115-6075",,,,,41,9,9,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

In recent years, overdependence on deeper and wider multinational supply and production chains and lean-optimization has led to tightly integrated systems with little slack and high sensitivity to disruptions. This study considers the impact of Emission Control Areas and establishes a link between environmental and network resilience performance for maritime supply chains using operational cost and SOx emissions cost metrics. The proposed methodological framework analyzes various abatement options, disruption intensities, fuel pricing instances and regulatory strategies. The methodology utilizes a minimum cost flow assignment and an arc velocity optimization model for vessel speed to establish the payoff for various network states. Additionally, an attacker defender game is set up to identify optimal regulatory strategies under various disruption scenarios. The results are complemented by a sensitivity analysis on SOx emissions pricing, to better equip policy makers to manage environmental and resilience legislation. The methodology and findings provide a comprehensive analytic approach to optimize maritime supply chain performance beyond minimisation of operational costs, to also minimize exposure to costly supply chain disruptions.","[Zavitsas, Konstantinos] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zis, Thalis] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; [Bell, Michael G.

The objective of the model is to maximise the total social welfare, which includes consumer surplus and operator's net profit. The model is solved by a heuristic solution procedure and tested on an idealized linear travel corridor. The case study considers the effects from population density, density distribution, size of residential area, P&R station location, distance from the residential area to centre business area (CBD), as well as the changes of residential area layout and population growth. Results show that P&R fits for low population density area while ODPB is more suitable for high population density area. Population distribution type has little influence on the services' social welfare. ODPB is a preferable service for the city which does not have advanced metro network. Besides, the investment time for building ODPB service in the planning horizon is discussed with consideration of the development of residential area.","[Zhang, Jie; Wang, David Z.

In the literature there are a variety of methods used for such elicitation; the concern of the experiment reported in this paper is to compare them. The methods we investigate are the following: Holt-Laury price lists; pairwise choices, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method; allocation questions. Clearly their relative efficiency in measuring risk aversion depends upon the numbers of questions asked; but the method itself may well influence the estimated risk-aversion. While it is impossible to determine a best' method (as the truth is unknown) we can look at the differences between the different methods. We carried out an experiment in four parts, corresponding to the four different methods, with 96 subjects. In analysing the data our methodology involves fitting preference functionals; we use four, Expected Utility and Rank-Dependent Expected Utility, each combined with either a CRRA or a CARA utility function. Our results show that the inferred level of risk aversion is more sensitive to the elicitation method than to the assumed-true preference functional. Experimenters should worry most about context.","[Zhou, Wenting; Hey, John] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Zhou, WT (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 4GA, N Yorkshire, England.",wentingzhou123@gmail.com; john.hey@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,17,21,2,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This study investigates how such distributional impacts are considered in the appraisal process for UK energy and climate policies. Using a scorecard developed to capture the guidance on policy appraisal and distributional analysis, 79 impact assessments were evaluated. The majority of these impact assessments either did not or only partially considered the impacts of policies on vulnerable groups in society, with only eight assessments containing more detailed distributional analysis. Moreover, a bias seems to exist as to which areas of energy and climate policy provide well-founded analysis and which do not. With further insights gained from interviews with relevant actors, this research concludes that political motivation, analytical difficulties and a lack of awareness of the prevalence and importance of distributional impacts are at the root of this insufficient consideration. Possible alterations to the current IA framework are presented, which aim to more firmly embed the distributional impact assessment in the appraisal process.","[Zimmermann, Michel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Environm & Urban Econ, BP 2137,Batiment BP,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pye, Steve] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, 14 Upper Wolburn Pl, London WC1H, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of London; University College London,"Zimmermann, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Environm & Urban Econ, BP 2137,Batiment BP,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",michel.zimmermann@epfl.ch; s.pye@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,9,9,3,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123,,,,,,594,601,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.062,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000453499700058,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper also aims to examine the extent to which trust and satisfaction mediate this effect. Design/methodology/approach It uses data collected from 600 respondents to survey questionnaires disseminated to stakeholders from 15 countries dealing with IBs. Structural equation modelling is adopted with a partial least square approach. Findings The results indicate that there is a significant impact of disclosure on stakeholders' trust, satisfaction, and loyalty. The results also indicate that there is a partial mediating effect of trust and satisfaction in the relationship between disclosure and loyalty. This paper is one of the first studies examining the effect of disclosure on stakeholders' loyalty. The authors provide novel findings, which have theoretical and practical implications for disclosure in IBs and their relationship with stakeholders. Originality/value The analysis offers a novel contribution to the Islamic banking literature by offering the first evidence on the impact of disclosure on stakeholders' trust, satisfaction, and loyalty.","[El-Halaby, Sherif] MSA Univ, Cairo, Egypt; [Hussainey, Khaled] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Abou-El-Sood, Heba] Cairo Univ, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Modern Sciences & Arts University (MSA); University of Portsmouth; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Hussainey, K (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",sismail@aou.edu.kw; khaled.hussainey@port.ac.uk; h.abouelsood@foc.cu.edu.eg,"Hussainey, Khaled/AFG-8056-2022; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; El-Halaby, Sherif/AAH-7213-2021","El-Halaby, Sherif/0000-0003-4716-4208; Abou-El-Sood, Heba/0000-0001-8740-0645",,,,,115,8,8,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the model's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions-roughly 20 times on average, across different correlation regimes.","[McCrickerd, Ryan; Pakkanen, Mikko S.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Pakkanen, MS (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.pakkanen@imperial.ac.uk,,"Pakkanen, Mikko/0000-0002-0696-4914",EPSRC CDT,EPSRC CDT(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"R.M. was supported by the EPSRC CDT in Financial Computing and Analytics.

While in the European Economic Area (EEA17), tertiary education is the only significant education-based determinant of the export market share, in CEECs; both the shares of the workforce with secondary and tertiary education are significant with the former having a greater impact. Some evidence is found for the hypothesized impact of the quality of education.","[Mulliqi, Arta] Dukagjini Coll, Dept Banking Finance & Accounting, Peja, Kosovo; [Adnett, Nick] Staffordshire Univ, Business Sch, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England; [Hisarciklilar, Mehtap] Univ Sussex, Sch Management Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rizvanolli, Artane] Riinvest Coll, Dept Econ, Prishtina, Kosovo",Staffordshire University; University of Sussex,"Mulliqi, A (通讯作者)，Dukagjini Coll, Dept Banking Finance & Accounting, Peja, Kosovo.",artamulliqi@gmail.com,"Mulliqi, Arta/AAY-4775-2021; Hisarciklilar, Mehtap/AFM-0960-2022","Hisarciklilar, Mehtap/0000-0002-2313-1375",,,,,72,11,12,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

While the impact of making inappropriate structural choices/assumptions on model predictions is well noted, there is a lack of clarity about the definition of key structural aspects, the process of developing model structure (including the development of conceptual models) and uncertainty associated with the structuring process (structural uncertainty) in guidelines developed by national funding bodies. This forms the focus of this article. Building on the reports of good modelling practice, and recognising the fundamental role of model structuring within the model development process, we specified key structural choices and provided ideas about model structuring for the future direction. This will help to further standardise guidelines developed by national funding bodies, with potential impact on transparency, comprehensiveness and consistency of model structuring. We argue that the process of model structuring and structural sensitivity analysis should be documented in a more systematic and transparent way in submissions to national funding bodies. Within the decision-making process, the development of conceptual models and presentation of all key structural choices would mean that national funding bodies could be more confident of maximising value for money when making public funding decisions.","[Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ & Policy Unit, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Bojke, Laura] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Adelaide; University of York - UK,"Afzali, HHA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ & Policy Unit, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,54,13,13,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36,11,,,,,1309,1319,,10.1007/s40273-018-0693-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0693-7,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30030816,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000446909400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It employs the panel cointegration tests of Pedroni (2004) and Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) with the level break/shift to a data set of 56 developing countries. The results provide evidence of a long run equilibrium relationship between access to electricity and labour productivity for developing countries in presence of the control variables. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) heterogeneous panel non-causality test underscores a bidirectional causal relationship between these two key variables in the short-run. Based on these results, we recommend that policymakers ensure access to electricity for mass people in developing countries to increase productivity and thus to improve the living standards of their citizens. The paper also provides specific policy initiatives related to the individual control variables in order to ensure access to electricity to advance productivity growth in the majority of the people in developing countries.","[Alam, Md.

This led to an expansion of handloom weaving and a rise in earnings in the 1790s, thereby, creating the golden age. The high earnings increased the profitability of developing the power loom by raising the value of the labour that it saved. Consequently, less efficient-hence, cheaper to develop-power looms could be brought into commercial use than would have been the case had the golden age not occurred. The power loom, in turn, devalued the old skills, so poverty accompanied progress.","[Allen, Robert C.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Fac Social Sci, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Allen, Robert C.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NH, England",New York University Abu Dhabi; University of Oxford,"Allen, RC (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Fac Social Sci, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.;Allen, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NH, England.",bob.allen@nyu.edu,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023",,,,,,70,5,6,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Industrial ecosystems are here defined as multi-tiered production systems involving heterogeneous agents operating in sectoral value chains and contributing to the capability domains of the ecosystem (and its participants) with closely complementary but dissimilar sets of resources and capabilities. The geographical boundaries of the industrial ecosystem are shaped by the evolving interdependencies linking organisations within the ecosystem and by the new linkages consolidating beyond that. Thus, the industrial ecosystem is a structured production space centred mainly on its productive organisations, as well as other institutions, intermediaries and demand-side actors, purposefully involved in co-value creation processes along various types of diversification and innovative industrial renewal trajectories. Drawing on a five-year research programme in the Emilia Romagna industrial ecosystem, a number of case studies are introduced to highlight these trajectories and the underpinning structural learning dynamics. The paper concludes by identifying a number of policy implications, focusing on strategies for enhancing the structural readiness of the industrial ecosystem and promoting smart diversification and innovative industrial renewal policies.","[Andreoni, Antonio] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Econ, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Andreoni, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",antonio.andreoni@soas.ac.uk,,"Andreoni, Antonio/0000-0001-9389-0927",Gatsby Charitable Foundation,Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"Senior Lecturer in Economics, Department of Economics, SOAS University of London.

By consequence, the deficit countries that attracted lots of foreign capital experienced large run-ups in house prices, whereas most surplus countries that exported capital exhibited flat or slow house price growth. We first use new house price data and a novel instrumental variable design to show the causal relationship between housing prices and capital inflows, particularly through debt bonanzas. We then argue that international capital flows affect the fiscal policy preferences of both voters and political parties by way of their impact on housing prices. Where capital inflows are large and housing prices are rising, we expect voters to respond by demanding both lower taxes and less publicly-provided social insurance because rising house prices allow homeowners to self-insure against income loss. In contrast, declining house prices produce greater demands for social insurance, particularly among those most exposed to housing market risk. We present evidence from two cross-national surveys that supports these claims, as well as a before and after analysis of the housing crash in Eastern Europe. We also show that the connection between house prices and social policy also manifests itself in government spending outcomes, mediated by partisan control.","[Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Broz, J.

The analysis focuses on a specific intersectoral demand-side channel for structural change: the forward linkage established by foreign manufacturing multinational enterprises (MNEs) with service providers through outsourcing in the UK local labour markets. Descriptive evidence shows that service outsourcing by foreign manufacturing plants is notably larger than that of their domestic counterparts. On this basic premise, we estimate the local multiplier effect that foreign manufacturing activity has on service employment. To test our hypotheses, the methodology adopts an instrumental variable approach. Our findings suggest that foreign MNEs in manufacturing can act as a catalyst for regional structural change by stimulating employment in intermediate services via demand linkages. While the composition of this effect seems to be homogeneous in terms of the knowledge content of services, differences are found once the degree of their spatial concentration is accounted for.","[Ascani, Andrea; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ascani, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Utrecht University,"Iammarino, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,"Ascani, Andrea/T-7092-2019","Ascani, Andrea/0000-0003-4738-3144; Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700",Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [ES/M008436/1]; ESRC [ES/M008436/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht University (AA); and Department of Geography and Environment, London School of Economics (AA, SI).

Increasing trend inflation from 2 to 4 percent generates a consumption-equivalent welfare loss of about 4 percent. Welfare costs of this magnitude are driven by: staggered wage contracts, trend growth, extended borrowing, a roundabout production structure, and the interaction between trend inflation and shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment (MEI). A sticky-price model abstracting from these features generates much smaller losses. Moderate trend inflation also has important business-cycle implications, interacting much more strongly with MEI shocks than with productivity or monetary shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We consider both intertemporal and intratemporal choices, and identify intensive and extensive responses in a consistent life-cycle framework, using US CEX data. Heterogeneity is due to observables, such as age, wealth, hours worked, and the wage level, as well as to unobservable tastes for leisure: the median Marshallian elasticity for hours worked is 0.18, with corresponding Hicksian elasticity of 0.54 and Frisch elasticity of 0.87. At the 90th percentile, these values are 0.79, 1.16, and 1.92. Responses at the extensive margin explain about 54% of the total labor supply response for women under 30, although this declines with age. Aggregate elasticities are higher in recessions, and increase with the length of the recession. The heterogeneity at the micro level means that the aggregate labor supply elasticity is not a structural parameter: any aggregate elasticity will depend on the demographic structure of the economy as well as the distribution of wealth and the particular point in the business cycle.","[Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter; Low, Hamish] IFS, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Low, Hamish] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander, Spain",University of London; University College London; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford; Universidad de Cantabria,"Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.;Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",o.attanasio@ucl.ac.uk; peter_l@ifs.org.uk; hamish.low@economics.ox.ac.uk; virginia.sanchez@unican.es,"Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",ESRC Professorial Fellowship; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Spanish MCYT [ECO2009-09614],ESRC Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Spanish MCYT(Spanish Government),"We are grateful for a number of useful conversations with Joe Altonji, Richard Blundell, Guy Laroque, Costas Meghir, Richard Rogerson, and Tom Sargent.

We also find a partial support for the hysteresis hypothesis in UK imports from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. We find that hysteresis can be both country- and commodity-dependent, which is largely consistent with previous empirical studies.

It suggests that these are a move in the right direction in so far as they acknowledge 'place' as a key, constituent part of policymaking. Drawing upon examples from across the world, we emphasise the importance of regions pursuing strategies that allow them to capture-in a sustainable way-a part of the value they help create and co-create with other entities, such as multinational firms and other organisations. This involves policymakers acting as public entrepreneurs, devising and implementing strategies, structures and policies to enable the regional ecosystem and its constituent parts to capture value sustainably. In addition to the extant focus on linkages and embeddedness, a key aspect of this involves the adoption of regional value capture and positioning strategies.","[Bailey, David] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Pitelis, Christos] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Pitelis, Christos] Queens Coll, Cambridge, England; [Tomlinson, Philip R.] Univ Bath, Ctr Governance Regulat & Ind Strategy, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",Aston University; Brunel University; University of Cambridge; University of Bath,"Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.;Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Inst Policy Res, Bath, Avon, England.;Tomlinson, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Ctr Governance Regulat & Ind Strategy, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.",P.R.Tomlinson@bath.ac.uk,"Tomlinson, Philip/AFJ-1113-2022; Pitelis, Christos N./O-3145-2015","Tomlinson, Philip/0000-0001-6292-3204;",,,,,108,72,73,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We present evidence that home-sourcing occurs in the context of a new competitive environment where the relative importance of scale economies versus variety is altered, and a recoupling of innovation and production within industrial ecosystems becomes desirable. We look at the determinants of manufacturing home-sourcing. We find that R&D-intensive businesses with core non-standardized products are more likely to switch sourcing of components to the home economy from abroad. Our findings provide evidence in favour of increasing trends towards closer value chains for knowledge-intensive production, suggesting that the possibilities for (and potential impact of) home-sourcing have not been fully recognised as pathways to industrial and economic renewal in mature economies. The implications for industrial policy are to focus on the resilience of existing national industrial ecosystems and their attractiveness and ability to integrate incoming business opportunities.","[De Propris, Lisa] Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Bailey, David] Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Corradini, Carlo] Univ Birmingham, Sch Business, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; Aston University; University of Birmingham,"De Propris, L (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",l.depropris@bham.ac.uk,,"De Propris, Lisa/0000-0002-1476-1674; Corradini, Carlo/0000-0001-9164-4108","EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity - Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [691192]","EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity - Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","The writing of this paper has been supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity is a project funded by the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, which is a Research and Innovation Staff Exchange under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, grant agreement number 691192.

We draw upon data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) on new long term care insurance (LTCI) purchases (traditional and Partnership) by US state (weighted by the population over age 65 to make the data comparable). We use a difference-in-differences strategy to obtain estimates of the program effect of the LTCP on the overall uptake of private LTCI, and specifically of LTCP contracts and applications for a subsample of states.

It was massive in scale, discrete in timing and exogenous to firms and consumers in the textile industry. Since the MFA quota removal did not affect all textile products at the same time, we are able to use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of the MFA. Using transaction-level data from the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics over the period 2000-06, we find that the MFA removal reduced average export prices by about 25%. This fall was mainly caused by a combination of the entry of new low-price exporters and new low-price products, rather than a fall in prices of existing firm-product combinations. We also find that price reductions are twice as large for heterogeneous than for homogeneous products.","[Bernhofen, Daniel] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy GEP, Nottingham, England; [Wang, Zheng] De Montfort Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leicester, Leics, England",American University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; De Montfort University,"Bernhofen, D (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wang, Zheng/0000-0001-6276-1831",,,,,19,5,5,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41,11,,,,,2983,3000,,10.1111/twec.12581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12581,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000450129200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

By identifying from variation in peers' import experience across source countries, by comparing the spillover from neighboring buildings with a cross-street placebo, and by exploiting plausibly exogenous firm moves, we obtain credible estimates and establish three results. (1) There are significant knowledge spillovers in both spatial and managerial networks. Having a peer which has imported from a particular country more than doubles the probability of starting to import from that country, but the effect quickly decays with distance. (2) Spillovers are heterogeneous: they are stronger when firms or peers are larger or more productive, and exhibit complementarities in firm and peer productivity. (3) The model-implied social multiplier is highly skewed, implying that targeting an import-encouragement policy to firms with many and productive neighbors can make it 26% more effective.

Using a minimum distance strategy, we find that international financial risk sharing is low even for advanced small open economies. Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents. However, vacancies and unemployment hardly respond whenever the real exchange rate channel is mute. These findings suggest the relevance of the open economy dimension for the transmission of demand type shocks to the labour market more generally.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under different gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty levels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic factor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six different indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary policy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of uncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe haven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be sensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and to whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a positive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty composite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under normal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio composed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.","[Bouoiyour, Jamal; Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, CATT, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",jamal.bouoiyour@univ-pau.fr; refk.selmi@univ-pau.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,"Jamal, Bouoiyour/0000-0003-1920-1155",,,,,41,73,77,4,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We find more equilibrium choices in the sequential version than in the simultaneous version of the game and we highlight the importance of attentional measures. Indeed, depending on the treatment, equilibrium behavior is 30 to 80 percentage points higher for subjects who look at all the payoffs necessary to compute the Nash equilibrium and for those who look at payoffs in the order predicted by the sequential elimination of dominated strategies than for subjects who do not. Finally, the sequence of lookups reveals that subjects have an easier time finding the player with a dominant strategy in the sequential timing than in the simultaneous timing. However, once this player is found, the unraveling logic of iterated elimination of dominated strategies is performed (equally) fast and efficiently under both timings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To understand this process, we propose a conceptual framework in which the introduction of religious competition shifts political markets where religious authorities provide legitimacy to rulers in exchange for control over resources. Consistent with our framework, religious competition changed the balance of power between secular and religious elites: secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation, particularly in Protestant regions. This transfer of resources had significant consequences. First, it shifted the allocation of upper-tail human capital. Graduates of Protestant universities increasingly took secular, especially administrative, occupations. Protestant university students increasingly studied secular subjects, especially degrees that prepared students for public sector jobs, rather than church sector specific theology. Second, it affected the sectoral composition of fixed investment. Particularly in Protestant regions, new construction shifted from religious toward secular purposes, especially the building of palaces and administrative buildings, which reflected the increased wealth and power of secular lords. Reallocation was not driven by preexisting economic or cultural differences. Our findings indicate that the Reformation played an important causal role in the secularization of the West.","[Cantoni, Davide] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany; CESIfo, Munich, Germany; London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cantoni, D (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany.",,,,Marie Curie Career Integration Grant; European Research Council from the European Union [638957]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [638957] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(Marie Curie Actions); European Research Council from the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor, Robert Barro, and four anonymous referees for valuable feedback.

The degree of integration and nonlinearity of both series are found to vary considerably across states, while the fractional cointegration analysis suggests that a long-run relationship exists between them in only 11 out of the 50 US states. The estimated long-run income elasticity of healthcare expenditure suggests that health care is a luxury good in these states. By contrast, the short-run elasticity obtained from the regressions in first differences is in the range (0, 1) for most US states, which suggests that health care is a necessity good instead. The implications of these results for health policy are also discussed.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ London, London, England; [Cunado, Juncal; Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",Brunel University; University of Navarra; University of Pretoria,"Cunado, J (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",jcunado@unav.es,"Cunado, Juncal/K-7303-2017","Cunado, Juncal/0000-0002-1597-9755",,,,,44,4,4,2,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

With limited liability, the agent's wage is increasing in output only if output exceeds a threshold, else it is zero regardless of output. If the threshold is sufficiently high, the agent only beats it, and is rewarded for increasing output through greater effort, if there is a high noise realization. Thus, a fall in output volatility reduces effort incentives information and effort are substitutes offsetting the standard effect that improved information lowers the cost of compensation.

Our model, which identifies the effect of quality on trade that arises on the demand side, through the relationship between income and quality choice, predicts that a negative income shock disproportionately reduces the demand for higher relative to lower quality traded goods (a flight from quality). Using a unique dataset of firm-level wine exports for an emerging market economy, Argentina, combined with experts wine ratings as a measure of quality, we find strong evidence of a flight from quality as we show that the values, volumes, unit values, and markups of higher quality exports contracted more sharply during the crisis. Our results imply that the exports of countries producing higher quality goods are likely to collapse more severely during recessions.","[Chen, Natalie] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Chen, Natalie] CAGE, London, England; [Chen, Natalie] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Chen, Natalie] CEPR, London, England; [Juvenal, Luciana] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Warwick; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund,"Chen, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",N.A.Chen@warwick.ac.uk; ljuvenal@imf.org,,,International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; ESRC [ES/P00766X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the co-editor Nathan Nunn and to two anonymous referees for their detailed comments.

This paper analyzes these two standards under imperfect competitive. We limit our attention to (1) short-run analyses and (2) a situation in which all states are subject to the same type of standard. We show that while the cross-subsidy inherent in the performance-based standard might effectively reduce power prices, it could also inflate energy consumption. A dominant firm with a relatively clean endowment under the performance-based standard would be able to manipulate the electricity market as well as to elevate permit prices, which might worsen market outcomes compared to its mass-based counterpart. On the other hand, the cross-subsidy could be the dominant force leading to a higher social welfare if the leader has a relatively dirty endowment.","[Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tanaka, Makoto] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of London; University College London; Stockholm University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",yihsuchen@ucsc.edu; mtanaka@grips.ac.jp; afzal.siddiqui@ucl.ac.uk,"; Tanaka, Makoto/M-9489-2014","Chen, Yihsu/0000-0002-9990-8232; Tanaka, Makoto/0000-0002-8606-865X",University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES) [1561144]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [26380291]; JSPS KAKENHI [15H02975]; HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02975] Funding Source: KAKEN,"University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Chen was supported by the University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program and the United States NSF (CyberSEES #1561144).

The supplier may enter the market by initially renting the downstream firm's reputation. The downstream firm may optimally source its input externally, even though sourcing internally would be better in terms of productive efficiency.

Received wisdom has it that attaching financial incentives to these reports will result in collusion, and undermine both objectives. Simple bargaining logic, however, suggests the reverse: pay for locally monitored performance could incentivize desired behavior and improve information. To investigate this issue, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in Ugandan primary schools that explored how incentives for teachers could be designed when based on local monitoring by head teachers. Our experiment randomly varied whether head teachers' reports of teacher attendance were tied to teacher bonus payments or not. We find that local monitoring on its own is ineffective at improving teacher attendance. However, combining local monitoring with financial incentives leads to both an increase in teacher attendance (by 8 percentage points) and an improvement in the quality of information. We also observe substantial gains in pupil attainment, driven primarily by a reduction in dropouts. By placing a financial value on these enrollment gains, we demonstrate that pay for locally monitored performance passes both welfare and fiscal sustainability tests.

However, trade-off questions can be hard to understand, and one standard type of question finds that a high proportion of respondentssometimes a majorityappear to give exclusive priority to reducing health inequality. We developed and tested two e-learning interventions designed to help respondents understand this question more completely. The interventions were a video animation, exposing respondents to rival points of view, and a spreadsheet-based questionnaire that provided feedback on implied trade-offs. We found large effects of both interventions in reducing the proportion of respondents giving exclusive priority to reducing health inequality, though the median responses still implied a high degree of health inequality aversion andunlike the videothe spreadsheet-based intervention introduced a substantial new minority of non-egalitarian responses.

Assignment to high performance pay via a market mechanism is roughly twice as effective as imposing the same contract exogenously. This positive effect is largely offset by a negative effect for workers that endogenously choose low performance pay. We decompose the positive effect of endogenous assignment to high performance pay into effects due to selection and strategic anticipation, and find that selection has a greater effect than strategic anticipation. We use a Reverse Sort treatment to show that the effect of selection is sufficiently strong to overcome the direct effect of lower performance pay, yielding coordination at high effort levels in spite of low incentives.

The contest organizer splits the overall prize of the competition into a targeted and an untargeted prize. The targeted prize is exclusively for disadvantaged (low-ability) agents and excludes advantaged agents partially from the overall prize. We consider a setting with one high-ability and two low-ability contestants and fully characterize equilibrium. Assuming that the contest organizer aims to maximize expected total effort, we show that (i) almost any targeted prize is preferable to a standard all-pay auction without targeted prize; (ii) the exclusion principle Baye et al. (1993) can be implemented by a wide range of sufficiently large targeted prizes; and (iii) partial exclusion by means of an appropriately chosen targeted prize benefits the organizer more than complete exclusion.

If the firm conceals information, it might be detected and fined. We show that optimal monitoring is determined by a trade-off. Overall, stricter enforcement reduces the incentives for selective reporting but crowds out information search. Our model implies that there are situations in which the relationship between the two monitoring instruments might be complementary. We also show that the welfare effects of mandatory disclosure depend on how it is enforced and that imperfect enforcement (in which some information remains concealed) might be optimal. In particular, the optimal fine might be smaller than the largest possible fine, even though the latter requires lower resource costs for inspections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a new mathematical model to optimize flights' 4D-trajectories. This is a multi-objective binary integer programming (IP) model, which assigns a 4D-trajectory to each flight, while explicitly modeling priorities and highlighting the trade off involved with the Airspace Users (AUs) preferences. The scope of the model (to be used at pre-tactical level) is the computation of optimal 4D pre-departure trajectory for each flight to be shared or negotiated with other stakeholders and subsequently managed throughout the flight. These trajectories are obtained by minimising the deviation (delay and re-routing) from the original preferred 4D-trajectories as well as minimizing the air navigation service (ANS) charges subject to the constraints of the system. Computational results for the model are presented, which show that the proposed model has the ability to identify trade-offs between the objectives of the stakeholders of the ATM system under the TBO concept. This can therefore provide the ATM stakeholders with useful decision tools to choose a trajectory for each flight.

In this paper we use the arrival of a new communication technology, ADSL broadband, to study the effects of heterogeneous types of ICT on firm performance. To do so free from endogeneity bias, we construct instruments using postcode-level geographic variation in the infrastructure underlying broadband internet - the pre-existing telephone network. We show that after placing various restrictions on the sample, instruments based on the timing of ADSL broadband enablement and the cable distance to the local telephone exchange satisfy the conditions for instrument relevancy and validity. We find in turn, that ICT causally affects firm size (captured by either sales or employment) but not productivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the contribution of changes in each determinant, I construct counterfactual emissions scenarios in a sample consisting of 34 sectors in 37 countries over 1995-2009. I compare these scenarios quantitatively using a novel metric, namely the relative cumulative emissions. I find that the composition of output and the carbon intensity of sectors individually or jointly constrained emissions in a large majority of countries. This motivates an analysis of high- and low-carbon intensity sectors, denoted HCI and LCI, where emissions and value-added tend to be concentrated, respectively. I document the cross-country variation in HCI sectors' carbon intensity and show it declines over time largely due to improvements in developing countries. HCI sectors tend to account for a smaller share of employment; be more capital intensive; and employ a workforce with a lower average skill level. Employment declined in HCI sectors and increased in LCI sectors with its composition shifting towards high-skilled workers in both. Capital intensity growth was faster but multifactor productivity growth was slower in HCI sectors.","[Doda, Baran] London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Doda, Baran] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Doda, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Doda, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",L.B.Doda@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council.

Our study finds that firms with higher conflicts of interest among managers and shareholders pay lower dividends. In the context of the conflicts of interest among major and minor shareholders, we find that such conflicts would exert little impact on dividend payments. Further, we find that the family-controlled firms prefer to pay less dividends whereas the corporations with higher state ownership are associated with larger dividend payments. Our findings are in line with the argument that the Indonesian state consider corporate dividends as one of the main sources of revenues other than corporate taxes in their government budget.

In Brazil, wage inequality has steadily declined since the early 1990s. Counterfactual exercises show that the evolutions of the schooling and experience premiums are key determinants of the decline in inequality. The 2000s witnessed a rapid decline in the schooling and experience premiums, at the same time as the working population was aging and becoming more educated. To understand these changes, the paper develops a model of imperfect substitution across experience and education groups and estimates the relevant elasticities of substitution. Changes in labor supply contributed significantly to the decline of the experience and education premiums, but are not enough to account fully for the observed changes. The demand for experience shifted in favor of younger workers, while the relative demand for college graduates declined during the 2000s.","[Fernandez, Manuel] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Messina, Julian] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Messina, Julian] IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany",University of Essex; Inter-American Development Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Messina, J (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",m.fernandersierra@essex.ac.uk; julianm@IADB.ORG,"Messina, Julian/ABE-9287-2021","Messina, Julian/0000-0002-3635-499X; Fernandez Sierra, Manuel/0000-0002-6447-6337",,,,,44,11,14,4,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Results from a fixed effects model suggest that, consistent with theory, pasture area declines and forest is spared in lots located closer to market.

This paper contributes to analyses of resilience by studying how theories of change (ToC) processes used by development organizations might lead to social exclusions, and seeking ways to make these more inclusive. Adopting insights from participatory monitoring and evaluation, the paper first presents fieldwork from four villages in Myanmar to compare local experiences of risk and resilience with the ToCs underlying pathways to resilience based on building anticipatory, absorptive, and adaptive capacities. The paper then uses interviews with the development organizations using these pathways to identify how ToC processes might exclude local experiences and causes of risk, and to seek ways to make processes more inclusive. The research finds that development organizations can contribute to shared ToCs for resilience, but adopt tacitly different models of risk that reduce attention to more transformative socio-economic pathways to resilience. Consequently, there is a need to consider how resilience and ToCs can become insufficiently scrutinized boundary objects when they are shared by actors with different models of risk and intervention.

The authors argue that the material legacy of deindustrialisation conditions the opportunities for survivor firms and creates specific, sub-sectoral industrial ecologies. Literature from economics, business studies, development and ecological studies is used to outline a framework that allows different possible relations between firm capability and local habitat. Two subsectors, carpets and apparel, are used to explore the notion of interaction between firm capability and ecology: though the context of deindustrialisation is similar in some respects, the specific conditions provide quite distinctive opportunities for renewal. In carpets, relatively larger firms have more successfully co-evolved with retailers through various kinds of mutuality; in apparel, a workshop sector of mainly small and micro firms frequently struggles with predatory behaviour by much larger retailers. The implication of this analysis is that industrial policy needs to be grounded in analysis of the capabilities-habitat interplay, focusing on areas where conditions are favourable or can be improved through supporting firm capabilities and modifying supply chain behaviours. The concepts and analysis are relevant for considering other industries and contexts where industrial renewal depends on producer firms and the ecology in which they operate.","[Froud, Julie; Wei, Hua; Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Hayes, Steven] Univ Manchester, Sch Mat, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester,"Froud, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",julie.froud@manchester.ac.uk,"Wei, Hua/GPS-7682-2022; Hayes, Steven/N-3607-2019","Hayes, Steven/0000-0002-6830-5818; Wei, Hua/0000-0003-2617-7632",,,,,80,6,7,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Can frictions generated by this type of financial complexity be so severe that they lead to a complete market freeze, like that of the recent financial crisis? Starting from an allocation that is not Pareto optimal, we find that whether complexity impedes trade depends on how investors perceive risk and uncertainty. For smooth convex preferences, such as subjective expected utility, complexity cannot halt trade, even in the extreme case where each investor is so unsophisticated that he can only trade up to one Arrow-Debreu security, without being able to combine two or more in order to construct a complex trade. However, for non smooth preferences, which allow for kinked indifference curves, such as maxmin expected utility, complexity can completely shut down trade. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The novel approach adopted here is to utilise its predictive ability for the whole distribution of future growth, rather than predicting the center of this distribution directly. Our results confirm previous findings that the yield spread does contain additional information about the future GDP growth, which varies over time. Most importantly, utilising the information contained in the whole conditional distribution of predicted GDP growth, rather than concentrating on the center of it, provides additional forecasting power for shorter (3-9 months) horizons. This approach is also superior in forecasting future expansionary phases, notably a more common phenomenon than recessions for which the traditional, OLS-based forecasts seem to perform better.","[Gebka, Bartosz] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Mammel Hall 332S, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Gebka, B (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",bartosz.gebka@ncl.ac.uk; mwohar@mail.unomaha.edu,"Gebka, Bartosz/I-5189-2019","Gebka, Bartosz/0000-0003-4510-0374; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,60,5,7,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

It can be argued that this approach ignores the preferences of people with experience of the condition, and that patient preferences have a place in the valuation of health outcomes. Here we report the estimation of a preference-based index for an existing condition-specific preference-based measure for multiple sclerosis (MS), the MSIS-8D, based on the preferences of people with MS. Study design: Internet time trade-off (TTO) survey, eliciting preferences from people with MS. Methods: We elicited preferences from a sample of people with MS (N = 1635) across 169 MSIS-8D health states, using the TTO technique. We fitted ordinary least squares and random effects models to the survey data to estimate values for all health states described by the MSIS-8D. Results: The new patient-derived index (the MSIS-8D-P) provides values ranging from 0.893 for the best possible health state to 0.138 for the worst state. The MSIS-8D-P exhibits good discriminative validity, identifying expected significant differences between groups based on presence/absence of MS, type of MS, and duration since diagnosis. Conclusions: The MSIS-8D-P index of values for MS-specific health states provides an opportunity to estimate QALYs based on patient preferences, for use in economic evaluations of treatments for MS. More broadly, it adds to the methods and data available to consider the health-related quality of life of people with MS to inform resource allocation and individual-level decisions regarding treatments for MS.","[Goodwin, Elizabeth; Green, Colin; Hawton, Annie] Univ Exeter, Inst Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Grp, Exeter, Devon, England; [Green, Colin; Hawton, Annie] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, South West Collaborat Leadership Appl Hlth Res &, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Goodwin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Hlth Econ Grp, St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England.",e.goodwin@exeter.ac.uk,,"Hawton, Annemarie/0000-0002-1336-5899; Goodwin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1351-9170",Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; UK National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC),Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; UK National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC),Financial support for this study was provided in part by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Through 21 expert interviews we establish the current state of DSR, and expectations for its development. Whilst non-domestic DSR appears healthy, if fragile, domestic DSR is considered to be currently unviable, it's future success dependant on market innovations. In following how that situation is expected to change, we highlight key assumptions about prospective end users. These assumptions are shaping the efforts of the industry actors tasked with delivering DSR. We identify two visions of the user, one passive whilst technologies automate on their behalf, the other integrated to the point of themselves being an automaton. We detail a series of concerns about the limitations of these user visions, and the ability of industry to reach beyond them towards a more differentiated view. We conclude with a call to broaden the institutional landscape tasked with delivering DSR, in order to foster a greater diversity of end user roles, and ultimately greater demand responsiveness from a broader user base.","[Goulden, Murray; Spence, Alexa; Wardman, Jamie; Leygue, Caroline] Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Leygue, Caroline] Tajin 380, Mexico City 03020, DF, Mexico",University of Nottingham,"Goulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",murray.goulden@nottingham.ac.uk,"Spence, Alexa/D-3646-2009","Spence, Alexa/0000-0003-4014-0430; Goulden, Murray/0000-0003-4005-8752; Wardman, Jamie/0000-0002-3609-7591","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Digital Economy grant [EP/M02315X/1]; Nottingham Research Fellowship; EPSRC [EP/M02315X/1, EP/K002589/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K002589/1, EP/M02315X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Digital Economy grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Nottingham Research Fellowship; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/M02315X/1] through the Horizon Digital Economy grant and by a Nottingham Research Fellowship.,,65,51,53,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122,,,,,,176,185,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.013,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000447576700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The local state has undergone substantial restructuring, driven by major budget reductions from central government. Hitherto, few studies of austerity in the UK have considered the interplay of national and local policies. We contribute a fine-grained spatial analysis of local authority budgets, highlighting their socioeconomically and geographically uneven impacts. We identify substantial variations between authorities in terms of funding, local tax-base, fiscal resources, assets, political control, service-need and demographics. We argue that austerity has actively reshaped the relationship between central and local government in Britain, shrinking the capacity of the local state, increasing inequality between local governments and exacerbating territorial injustice.","[Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Gray, Mia; Barford, Anna] Girton Coll, Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0JG, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Gray, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.;Gray, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.;Gray, M (通讯作者)，Girton Coll, Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0JG, England.",pmg27@cam.ac.uk; ab423@cam.ac.uk,,,Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Academy; Canada-UK Foundation,Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; British Academy; Canada-UK Foundation,"This research was supported by funding from the Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust, the British Academy, and the Canada-UK Foundation.",,77,222,234,13,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Four EMR instruments combined to revolutionize the sector; stimulating unprecedented technological and structural change. Competitive auctions for both firm capacity and renewable energy have seen prices far lower than predicted and the entry of unexpected new technologies. A carbon price floor displaced coal, whose share fell from 46% in 1995 to 7% in 2017, halving CO2. Renewables grew from under 4% in 2008 to 22% by 2017, projected at 30+% by 2020 despite a political ban on onshore wind.

J,"Harrison, E",,,,"Harrison, Elizabeth",,,Engineering change? The idea of 'the scheme' in African irrigation,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Irrigation; Schemes; Development; Africa; Malawi,WATER MANAGEMENT; LAND; INFRASTRUCTURE; PARTICIPATION; PARTNERSHIP; STATE,"Despite a growing recognition of the significance of farmer-led irrigation, externally engineered and induced schemes remain a popular model for irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa. These have had a mixed record, and many have been widely critiqued. Nonetheless, schemes that were initiated under colonialism have been rehabilitated and new schemes are still being developed. This paper interrogates the continuing attraction of this model for irrigation, asking how and why it persists. Is the fact that engineering is so central to irrigation schemes another example of 'high modernism', as Scott might argue? Analysis of the history and current policy-making context of a new irrigation scheme in Malawi suggests a picture that is more complex, in which practical engineering considerations combine with narratives of modernisation and political imperatives to create momentum and lock-in. Understanding this, and why lessons from the past inadequately shape future-directed planning requires interrogation of the positionality of those involved, including state, donors and private sector actors and the political, economic and discursive fields in which they operate.

This has the potential to improve the allocation of research budgets. Despite this, practical EVSI evaluations are limited partly due to the computational cost of estimating this value using the gold-standard nested simulation methods. Recently, however, Heath et al. developed an estimation procedure that reduces the number of simulations required for this gold-standard calculation. Up to this point, this new method has been presented in purely technical terms. Study Design: This study presents the practical application of this new method to aid its implementation. We use a worked example to illustrate the key steps of the EVSI estimation procedure before discussing its optimal implementation using a practical health economic model. Methods: The worked example is based on a three-parameter linear health economic model. The more realistic model evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a new chemotherapy treatment, which aims to reduce the number of side effects experienced by patients. We use a Markov model structure to evaluate the health economic profile of experiencing side effects. Results: This EVSI estimation method offers accurate estimation within a feasible computation time, seconds compared to days, even for more complex model structures. The EVSI estimation is more accurate if a greater number of nested samples are used, even for a fixed computational cost. Conclusions: This new method reduces the computational cost of estimating the EVSI by nested simulation.","[Heath, Anna; Baio, Gianluca] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England",University of London; University College London,"Heath, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Stat Sci, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",anna.heath.14@ucl.ac.uk,"Baio, Gianluca/A-2947-2012; Heath, Anna/ABC-5862-2021",,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Mapi,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Mapi,"Financial support for this study was provided in part by grants from Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC; to Anna Heath) and Mapi (to Dr. Gianluca Baio).

It is skewed with a long right tail. This is consistent with both the widespread use of stop-loss strategies in financial markets, and recent experimental evidence.

We argue that this can be the result of a constrained optimal award procedure: The procurer awards the contract via a price-only auction and cannot commit not to renegotiate. If cost differences are more pronounced for a fancy than a standard design, it is optimal to fix the standard design ex ante. If renegotiation takes place and the fancy design has higher production costs or the contractor's bargaining position is strong, the final price exceeds the initial price.

While that effect varies by country, there are likely to be commonalities. Thus, research on a relatively small advanced open economy like New Zealand can provide insight into the general effect. In this study monthly data from 1991 to 2017 is used to examine how aging population in New Zealand affects its stock market considering key demographic and non-demographic macroeconomic variables and a new focus on fast-and-slow-moving institutional change. The results suggest that the net effect of an aging population on stock markets is insignificant. However, real GDP and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) show a positive relationship with the stock market. The findings reveal that FPI can mitigate possible negative effects from aging in an open economy. Moreover, the policy implications of the study suggest that international-factor mobility, skilled-migration policies, and technology-based productivity growth can boost stock markets.","[Hettihewa, Samanthala] Federat Univ Australia, Fac Business, POB 663, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia; [Saha, Shrabani; Zhang, Hanxiong] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England",Federation University Australia; University of Lincoln,"Saha, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England.",s.hettihewa@federation.edu.au; SSaha@lincoln.ac.uk; hzhang@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,1,1,1,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Either voters are content to trust their governments, because issues have low salience, or governments react to voters' preferences. How far is this 'supply side' of the theory still valid in the newly politicized world of EU politics? This article discusses the assumptions about representation in the theory, and looks at the conditions under which the assumptions might still hold and what this means for EU politics today. If the representational assumptions still hold in this highly politicized EU world, then the theory would predict policy gridlock. On the other hand, if there is a growing gap between publics and elites, then the assumptions, and the related propositions about the democratic deficit, no-longer hold. Either way, the inherent optimism of the theory is undermined.","[Hix, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hix, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.hix@lse.ac.uk,,"Hix, Simon/0000-0002-3116-5292",,,,,38,14,15,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Methods The research design and data collection followed a protocol developed by the EuroQol Group. The EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) software was administered using computer-assisted personal interviews to a representative sample of adults resident in Ireland between 2015 and 2016. Utility values were elicited using two stated-preference techniques: time trade-off (TTO) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE). Each respondent completed a valuation exercise in which the EQ-VT system randomly selected one block of ten TTO questions from ten blocks relating to a possible 86 health states. One block of seven DCE pairs from 28 blocks of a possible 196 pairs of health states were randomly selected to accompany this. The relationship between utility values and health states was analysed using a hybrid regression model that combined data from the TTO and DCE techniques and expressed these as a function of the health state presented to the individual. This model estimated coefficients for 20 dummy variables that characterised each health state in the EQ-5D-5L framework, with the lowest level of severity providing the reference category in each domain. The relationship between weighted and unweighted TTO and DCE analyses of main effects was analysed separately. Results Comparison of weighted and unweighted models revealed no substantive differences in results with respect to either DCE or TTO models. The unweighted hybrid model produced estimated effects, the ordering of which was intuitively consistent within each domain: lower levels of health were associated with lower utility values. Differences were evident between domains with respect to valuations; the disutility associated with conditions related to anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort was higher than for other domains. The decrement in utility associated with movement from the highest to the lowest level of health was 0.344 for mobility, 0.287 for self-care, 0.187 for usual activities, 0.510 for pain/discomfort and 0.646 for anxiety/depression. Discussion The results present the first value set based on the EQ-5D-5L framework for a representative sample of residents in Ireland. The set reveals a higher decrement in utility associated with anxiety/depression than with other domains of health. Caution is warranted in comparisons with other value sets. That said, those in England, the Netherlands, Uruguay and China reveal that, whereas Irish values are broadly consistent with respect to mobility, self-care and usual activities, residents of Ireland attach a higher decrement to pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression than do other populations.","[Barry, Luke; Kelleher, Dan] NUI Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Shah, Koonal; Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Goni, Juan Manuel Ramos] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hobbins, Anna; O'Neill, Ciaran] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Queens University Belfast,"O'Neill, C (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",Ciaran.oneill@qub.ac.uk,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Kelleher, Dan P./JNT-6194-2023","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; o'neill, ciaran/0000-0001-7668-3934; Hobbins, Anna/0000-0002-5532-3830",Health Research Board [RL/2013/16]; EuroQol Foundation; Health Research Board (HRB) [RL-2013-16] Funding Source: Health Research Board (HRB),Health Research Board; EuroQol Foundation; Health Research Board (HRB)(Health Research Board - Ireland),This study was funded by the Health Research Board under a Research Leader Award held by Ciaran O'Neill RL/2013/16.

It allows for simultaneity in the econometric sense that the two realized outcomes depend structurally on each other. Another feature of the proposed model is that it will generate equal durations with positive probability. Our approach takes a stylized economic model that leads to a univariate generalized accelerated failure time model as a starting point. In this model, agents decide when to transition from an initial state to a new one, and the covariates influence the difference in the utility flow in the two states. We introduce simultaneity by allowing the utility flow to depend on the status of the other person. The econometric model is then completed by assuming that the observed outcome is the Nash bargaining solution in that simple economic model. The advantage of this approach is that it includes independent realizations from the generalized accelerated failure time model as a special case, and deviations from this special case can be given an economic interpretation. We established identification under assumptions that are similar to those in the literature on nonparametric estimation of duration models. We illustrate the model by studying the joint retirement decisions in married couples using the Health and Retirement Study. In that example, it seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that each partner's optimal retirement time depends on the retirement time of the spouse. Moreover, the data suggest that the wife and the husband retire at the same time for a nonnegligible fraction of couples. The main empirical finding is that the simultaneity is economically important. In our preferred specification, the indirect utility associated with being retired increases by approximately 5% when one's spouse retires.","[Honore, Bo E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [de Paula, Aureo] UCL, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, FGV,CeMMAP, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, High Wycombe, Bucks, England",Princeton University; University of London; University College London,"Honoré, BE (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",honore@princeton.edu; a.paula@ucl.ac.uk,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448",Center for Retirement Research (Boston College); National Science Foundation; Gregory C.

Senegalese female sex workers (FSWs) are required to register with a health facility and to attend monthly routine health checks aimed at testing and treating sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Compliance to those routine visits is recorded on a registration card that must be carried by FSWs in order to avoid sanctions in case of police arrests. Although this policy was first introduced in 1969 to limit the spread of STIs, there is no evidence so far of its impact on FSWs' health and well-being. The paper aims to fill this gap by exploiting a unique data set of registered and unregistered Senegalese FSWs. Using propensity score matching, we find that registration has a positive effect on FSWs' health. However, we find that registration reduces FSWs' subjective well-being. This finding is explained by the fact that registered FSWs are found to engage in more sex acts, in riskier sex acts, have less social support from their peers, and are more likely to experience violence from clients and police officers. We prove that those results are robust to the violation of the conditional independence assumption, to misspecification of the propensity score model, and that covariate balance is achieved. The results suggest that more efforts should be deployed to reduce the stigma associated with registration and to address the poor well-being of FSWs, which is counterproductive to HIV prevention efforts.","[Ito, Seiro] Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Lepine, Aurelia] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Treibich, Carole] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Engn Univ, INRA, Grenoble Alpes, Gael, France",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lépine, A (通讯作者)，15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",aurelia.lepine@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Treibich, Carole/0000-0001-5582-868X; Lepine, Aurelia/0000-0002-9237-2914",Medical Research Council UK [MR/L012057/1]; Aix-Marseille School of Economics seed award; MRC [MR/L012057/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Aix-Marseille School of Economics seed award; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),Medical Research Council UK.

We formally demonstrate that existing strategies for detecting selection based on such 'unused characteristics' can lead to incorrect conclusions if the estimated coefficients of interest are driven by different parts of the population. We show that this issue can empirically be accounted for by allowing for heterogeneous parameters. We compare existing approaches by using simulated data with different selection regimes and test for parameter heterogeneity within the data. We further provide empirical evidence about selection into the market for private health insurance in England. Both our simulations, and the findings using real data, suggest that parameter heterogeneity is a relevant issue that can confound the interpretation of standard 'unused characteristics' approaches. Our findings are important for analysing the efficiency of insurance markets. They are of interest to both the insurance industry and policymakers, and should be accounted for when selection based on specific characteristics needs to be detected or the effects of structural changes of insurance policies/markets are to be predicted.

We review the debates prompted by LI's three core claims about national preference formation, intergovernmental bargaining and institutional choice, as well as by the theory's three policy-relevant corollaries relating to the EU's democratic deficit, its constitutional settlement and its role in the world. Liberal intergovernmentalism, we argue, remains highly relevant in today's EU, offering important insights and serving to structure much of the academic debate about the prospects of the Union in a time of crisis. Nevertheless, a revitalized LI faces the dual challenges of theorizing both the causes and consequences of mass politicization of EU politics, as well as the prospect of endogenous change in the direction of greater integration or disintegration.","[Kleine, Mareike] London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Pollack, Mark] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kleine, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.o.kleine@lse.ac.uk,"Pollack, Mark/ADW-3218-2022; Kleine, Mareike/AAP-6202-2020","Kleine, Mareike/0000-0002-7442-7328",EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,"We would like to thank Frank Schimmelfennig and Alasdair Young for their comments on early drafts of this introduction.

This fuels the concern that an environmental tax reform could be regressive. We employ a framework which accounts for the distributional effect of environmental taxes and the recycling of the revenues on both households and firms to quantify changes in the optimal tax structure and the equity impacts of an environmental tax reform. We characterize when an optimal environmental tax reform does not increase inequality, even if the tax system before the reform is optimal from a non-environmental point of view. If the tax system before the reform is calibrated to stylized dataand is thus non-optimalwe find that there is a large scope for inequality reduction, even if the government is restricted in its recycling options.","[Klenert, David; Schwerhoff, Gregor; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Mattauch, Linus] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Klenert, David] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Klenert, David; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Mattauch, Linus] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Mattauch, Linus] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",klenert@mcc-berlin.net; schwerhoff@mcc-berlin.net; edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de; linus.mattauch@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Schwerhoff, Gregor/L-2365-2019; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Schwerhoff, Gregor/0000-0003-3644-3447; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,43,33,34,5,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We show the knowledge of the discount factor is not necessary to identify parts, or even all, of the payoff function. We show the discount factor can be generically identified jointly with the payoff parameters. On the other hand, it is known the payoff function cannot be nonparametrically identified without any a priori restrictions. Our identification of the discount factor is robust to any normalization choice on the payoff parameters. In IO applications, normalizations are usually made on switching costs, such as entry costs and scrap values. We also show that switching costs can be nonparametrically identified, in closed-form, independently of the discount factor and other parts of the payoff function. Our identification strategies are constructive. They lead to easy to compute estimands that are global solutions.

Travellers choose between multiple alternatives, have heterogeneous values of travel times, and may differ in their valuation of variety. We derive first-best and second-best tolls taking into account how the overall network demand responds to expected generalized prices, including tolls. For second-best pricing, we show that with homogeneous values of times the welfare losses of second-best pricing are smaller when route choice is probabilistic than when route choice is deterministic. Furthermore, we find that with heterogeneous values of times and benefits of variety, uniform second-best tolls and group-differentiated tolls can be very close, implying potentially low welfare losses from the inability to differentiate tolls. Finally, we show that there are cases where all groups benefit from second-best congestion pricing, but that these cases are likely to be politically unacceptable because tolls are then higher for low income groups.

Objectives: There is a growing demand for value sets for the EQ-5D-Y (EQ-5D instrument for younger populations). Given the similarities between EQ-5D-Y and EQ-5D-3L, we investigated whether valuations of health states were affected by the differences in wording between the two instruments and by the perspective taken in the valuation exercise (child or adult). Study Design: Respondents were randomly assigned to EQ-5D-3L or EQ-5D-Y (instrument) and further into two groups that either valued health states for an adult or for a 10-year-old child (perspective). The valuation tasks were composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCE), including comparisons with death (DCE + death). Members of the adult general population in four countries (Germany, Netherlands, Spain, England) participated in computer-assisted personal interviews. Methods: Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and post hoc tests were used to compare C-TTO responses and chi-square tests were conducted to compare DCE + death valuations. Results: A significant interaction effect between instrument and perspective for C-TTO responses was found. Significant differences by perspective (adult and child) occurred only for the EQ-5D-3L. Significant differences in values between instruments (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-Y) occurred only for the adult perspective. Both significant results were confirmed by the DCE + death results. When comparing EQ-5D-3L for adult perspective and EQ-5D-Y for child perspective, values were also significantly different. Conclusions: The results identified an interaction effect between wording of the instrument and perspective on elicited values, suggesting that current EQ-5D-3L value sets should not be employed to assign values to EQ-5D-Y health states.","[Kreimeier, Simone; Greiner, Wolfgang] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Fac Hlth Sci, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Oppe, Mark; Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Stolk, Elly] Off EuroQol Res Fdn, Marten Meesweg 107, NL-3068 AV Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cole, Amanda; Devlin, Nancy; Herdman, Michael; Shah, Koonal K.] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Bielefeld; University of Technology Sydney; University of Oxford,"Kreimeier, S (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Univ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Fac Hlth Sci, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.;Oppe, M (通讯作者)，Off EuroQol Res Fdn, Marten Meesweg 107, NL-3068 AV Rotterdam, Netherlands.",simone.kreimeier@uni-bielefeld.de,"Herdman, Michael/AAI-7280-2020; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Cole, Amanda/M-3752-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544; Kreimeier, Simone/0000-0002-4832-7833",EuroQol Research Foundation [2014160],EuroQol Research Foundation,Research was funded by a research grant (reference number: 2014160) awarded by the EuroQol Research Foundation.,,33,69,71,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21,11,,,,,1291,1298,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.002,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442276,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000450111400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such gender biases have also positive impact on girls' (boys') enrollment in advanced level math courses in high school. These results suggest that teachers' biased behavior at early stages of schooling has long run implications for occupational choices and earnings at adulthood, because enrollment in advanced courses in math and science in high school is a prerequisite for post-secondary schooling in engineering, computer science and so on.

Understanding the assault on the public sector,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,SUBPRIME MORTGAGE; AUSTERITY; POLITICS; CRISIS; RETRENCHMENT; REVENGE; SERVICE; GENDER; RISE; RACE,"This article explores the 'shrinking state', the potential erosion of the state from its customary intervention in regulating economic growth and promoting redistribution and the overall weakening of the state as an institution in local/regional affairs. State retreat may be seen in the withdrawal of finance, services and staff as well as the failure to increase these resources to match growing needs, both of which are referred to as 'retrenchment' or, in the European case, 'austerity'. The erosion of the state as an institution is visible in underfunded social programmes, a smaller public sector, weakened regulatory structures, foregone infrastructure projects, public assets sales and continued privatization. This article argues that the 'shrinking state' both produces and is a product of a restructured social contract between government and citizens and the private sector that has transformed regions and localities. Although we have not seen wholesale state decline, there have been gradations of state change, especially in qualitative markers such as shifts in state functions, scales of activity, constituencies served and private sector involvement in governmental affairs. These changes, in turn, have led to shifts in state capacity and policy orientation that leave populations bereft of needed public services, increased inequality across geographic areas and sociodemographic groups, and political effects such as the growth of right-wing populism.","[Lobao, Linda] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gray, Mia] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Cox, Kevin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kitson, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge,"Lobao, L (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lobao.1@osu.edu; Mia.Gray@geog.cam.ac.uk; cox.13@osu.edu; mk24@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,96,75,78,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

This article uses the Black & Scholes model to calculate implied volatilities and their corresponding implied options to illustrate arbitrage opportunities when exchange options emerge.

This assumption is often questionable, aseven given the observed datathe probability that data are missing may reflect the true, unobserved outcomes, such as the patients' true health status. In these cases, methodological guidelines recommend sensitivity analyses to recognise data may be missing not at random (MNAR), and call for the development of practical, accessible approaches for exploring the robustness of conclusions to MNAR assumptions. Little attention has been paid to the problem that data may be MNAR in health economics in general and in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) in particular. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework for CEA where outcome or cost data are missing. Our framework includes a practical, accessible approach to sensitivity analysis that allows the analyst to draw on expert opinion. We illustrate the framework in a CEA comparing an endovascular strategy with open repair for patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and provide software tools to implement this approach.","[Mason, Alexina J.; Gomes, Manuel; Grieve, Richard] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Carpenter, James R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London, England; [Carpenter, James R.] UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London,"Mason, AJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",alexina.mason@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Gomes, Manuel/0000-0002-1428-1232; Mason, Alexina/0000-0001-7319-4545; Carpenter, James/0000-0003-3890-6206; Grieve, Richard/0000-0001-8899-1301","MRC [MR/K02177X/1, MC_UU_12023/21] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12023/21, MR/K02177X/1] Funding Source: Medline; Department of Health [SRF-2013-06-016] Funding Source: Medline",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Department of Health,,,49,12,12,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27,11,,,,,1670,1683,,10.1002/hec.3793,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3793,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29969834,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000446323300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.

We contend that such divides are also reflected and reinforced by preferences, attitudes and predispositions for culture. More specifically we argue that Americans' preferences for music will reflect dimensions of these political and economic divides. To test this proposition, our research examines the geographic variation of five key categories of music preferences across 95 of the largest US metropolitan areas. We use factor analysis to identify and map geographic variation of musical preferences, and we use both bivariate correlation analyses and regression analysis to examine the associations between metro-level musical preferences and key economic, demographic, political, and psychological variables.

Covariate-adjusted parametric curves for time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression survival were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term ipilimumab survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab, ipilimumab, and dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric curves, controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data from the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource use data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to receive nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the first of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2years of treatment.ResultsNivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF mutation-negative and mutation-positive patients, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 24,483 and 17,362 pound per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The model results are most sensitive to assumptions regarding treatment duration for nivolumab and the parameters of the fitted parametric survival curves.Conclusions Nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment for advanced melanoma patients in England.","[Meng, Yang; Philips, Zoe; Roskell, Neil; Lee, Dawn] BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hertel, Nadine; Ellis, John; Morais, Edith] Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceut, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Johnson, Helen] Helen Johnson Consulting Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Walker, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Bristol-Myers Squibb; University of Glasgow,"Meng, Y (通讯作者)，BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",ymeng@bresmed.com,"lee, dawn/GRJ-7459-2022","Meng, Yang/0000-0003-1866-537X",Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals,Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a contract with Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals.

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000-2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port - factors associated with institutional arrangements - to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements - that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens - are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization). Inclusive institutions not only foster economic growth but improve health and well-being too. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A committee convened at time t decides on consumption at t, accounting for the behaviour of future committees. Committee members disagree about the appropriate value of the pure rate of time preference, but must nevertheless reach a decision. If each committee aggregates its members' preferences in a utilitarian manner, the collective preferences of successive committees will be time inconsistent, and they will implement inefficient consumption plans. If however committees decide on the level of consumption by a majoritarian vote in each period, they may improve on the consumption plans implemented by utilitarian committees. Using a simple model, we show that this occurs in empirically plausible cases. Application to the problem of choosing the social discount rate is discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Market halls were the most visible manifestation of this, and were important public buildings. This article looks beyond the imposing architecture to take a more critical view of their function and justification. It argues that while most were well-managed and earned income in excess of current expenditure, very substantial investment in large and elaborate buildings was hard to justify in purely financial terms. The return on capital was often negligible. Food and drink traders were the largest group in almost all markets, but there were significant numbers of traders selling clothing, textiles, and household goods. There was some justification to complaints that local authorities were providing publicly financed miscellaneous shops in competition with rent- and rate-paying shopkeepers.

It, however, does not provide a preference-based health utility score required for estimating quality-adjusted life-years in economic evaluations for health technology assessments. Objectives: To develop algorithms for mapping from measures used in MND clinical studies to allow for future prediction of the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) utility in populations of patients with MND when utility data have not been collected. Methods: Direct mapping models were developed using ordinary least squares and Tobit regression analyses to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities (based on English tariffs), with ALSFRS-R total, domain, and item scores used as explanatory variables, using patient-level data from a UK cohort study. Indirect mapping models were also used to map EQ-5D-5L domains, using the same variables, along with the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Goodness of fit was assessed along with predicted values for each mapping model. Results: The best-performing model predicting EQ-5D-5L utilities used five items of the ALSFRS-R items as explanatory variables in a stepwise ordinary least squares regression. The mean squared error was 0.0228, and the mean absolute error was 0.1173. Prediction was good, with 55.4% of estimated values within 0.1 and 91.4% within 0.25 of the observed EQ-5D-5L utility value. Indirect mapping using the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND provided less predictive power than direct mapping models. Conclusions: This is the first study to present mapping algorithms to crosswalk between ALSFRS-R and EQ5D-5L. This analysis demonstrates that the ALSFRS-R can be used to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities when they have not been collected directly within a trial.","[Moore, Alan; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Eualuat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Young, Carolyn A.] Walton Ctr NHS Trust, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; Walton Centre,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Eualuat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Young, Carolyn A/IWD-4833-2023; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Young, Carolyn A/0000-0003-1745-7720; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network; Motor Neurone Disease Association UK; Walton Neurological Disability Fund,National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network; Motor Neurone Disease Association UK; Walton Neurological Disability Fund,The National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network provided research support and the Motor Neurone Disease Association UK and the Walton Neurological Disability Fund provided funding for this study.,,31,9,10,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21,11,,,,,1322,1329,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.005,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442280,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000450111400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the implications are not worked through into energy policy nor into most analyses of energy demand. Instead, energy service demand is usually isolated from its dynamic and varied socio-cultural basis, rendering it inappropriately static and neglecting the core quality of usefulness that definitions of 'energy service' share. To address these limitations, this paper revisits and extends a sociological conceptualisation of services, referred to here as meta-services. These are composite and cross-cutting formations of convention, expectation and experience and the means of achieving them. Meta-services are more-than-energy services and are shaped not only through energy consumption, provision and governance but also by a range of other non-energy providers and organisations. This calls for demand reduction policies to engage wider coalitions of service 'stakeholders'. In addition, because energy-services co-constitute meta-services, aspirations to deliver the same levels of service but more efficiently risk entrenching, rather than reducing, levels of service demand. Implications for service based business models (servicizing) and policies are discussed.","[Morley, Janine] Univ Lancaster, DEMAND Ctr, Sociol, D10,FASS Bldg, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England",Lancaster University,"Morley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, DEMAND Ctr, Sociol, D10,FASS Bldg, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England.",j.morley@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Morley, Janine/0000-0003-0255-4720","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), United Kingdom, Research Councils UK (RCUK) Energy Programme [EP/K011723/1]; EDF, R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), United Kingdom, Research Councils UK (RCUK) Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EDF, R&D ECLEER Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The author would like to thank colleagues at the Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand (DEMAND) Centre for discussions and comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Where social welfare systems are insufficient, these costs may fall to other family members. We set out to estimate the association between long-term care needs and family transfers in selected low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We used data from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). Using regression, we analysed the relationship between long-term care needs in older households and i) odds of receiving net positive transfers from family outside the household and ii) the amount of transfer received, controlling for relevant socio-demographic characteristics. Results: The proportion of household members requiring long-term care was significantly associated with receiving net positive transfers in China (OR: 1.76; p = 0.023), Ghana (OR: 2.79; p = 0.073), Russia (OR: 3.50; p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant association with amount of transfer received only in Mexico (B: 541.62; p = 0.010). Conclusion: In selected LMICs, receiving family transfers is common among older households, and associated with requiring long-term care. Further research is needed to better understand drivers of observed associations and identify ways in which financial protection of older adults' long-term care needs can be improved.

It extends earlier work by measuring protection from NTMs over time from a newly available database and provides evidence on the evolution of NTMs. In particular, building on Kee et al. (Econ J 119(534):172-199, 2009), this paper estimates the ad valorem equivalents of NTMs for 97 countries at the product level over the period 1997-2015. We show that the incidence and the intensity of NTMs were both increasing over this period, with NTMs becoming an even more dominant source of trade protection. We are also able to investigate the evolution of overall protection derived jointly from tariffs and NTMs. The results show that the overall protection level, for most countries and products, has not decreased despite the fall in tariffs associated with multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements in recent decades. We also document an increase in overall trade protection during the recent 2008 financial crisis. Overall, this study sheds light on an under-researched aspect of trade liberalization: the proliferation and increase of NTMs.","[Niu, Zhaohui] Beihang Univ, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gunessee, Saileshsingh] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Milner, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Beihang University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham,"Milner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",chris.milner@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,43,45,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Given the focus of Islamic stock screening on the debt ratio, we use data from 320 firms for eight European countries which were classified according to their level of debt and size. For this, the portfolio optimisation based Mean-Variance Efficient Frontier (MVEF), the Sharpe Ratio and the Capital Market Line (CML) were employed. Our findings tend to demonstrate that, under shocks, high leverage worsens the portfolio return, volatility, and value at risk. The results further point out that optimal portfolio composition is obtained through a high proportion of low debt funds in the case of two separate equity funds, of low debt and high debt portfolios respectively. The systematic risk of several portfolio strategies is further explored with regards to a benchmark of European index and market-wide, return and volatility shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use longitudinal data from a cohort of 700 Peruvian children drawn from a very rich dataset, the Young Lives Survey, to test the impact of children's perception of respect at the age of 8 on cognitive achievement 4 years later, controlling for cognitive skills at the age of 8, lagged child and household characteristics, and community fixed effects. This empirical specification is akin to estimating a conditional demand function for cognitive skills, which deals with some of the main pitfalls of skill endogeneity. We find that poorly respected children are linked to a lower rate of cognitive accumulation than their better-respected counterparts. As expected, we also find that previously accumulated cognitive skills enable higher subsequent cognitive skill accumulation. We go one step further by testing and finding evidence of complementarities across skills. We show that cognitive differences amplify over time between children with low and high psychosocial skills. Overall, our results suggest that psychosocial status, an aspect little studied in the context of developing countries, plays an important role in the acquisition of cognitive skills during childhood.","[Outes, Ingo] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Sanchez, Alan] Grp Anal Desarrollo, Lima, Peru; [Molina, Oswaldo] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru",University of Oxford; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Molina, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru.;Molina, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Ave Salaverry 2020, Jesus Maria 15072, Peru.",o.molinac@up.edu.pe,"Sánchez, Alan/AAM-1982-2021; Sánchez, Alan/JQX-2450-2023","Sánchez, Alan/0000-0001-7109-8613;",Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),This research was partially funded by an student grant from the Oxford Department of International Development (Young Lives Study),,23,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Evidence from the 1980 Crude Oil Windfall Act,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Federalism; Vertical fiscal reactions; Common-pool problem; Complementarities; Natural resources,TAX EXTERNALITIES; TAXATION; INCOME; FEDERALISM; GOVERNMENT; SYSTEM,"In economies with multi-level governments, why would a change in the fiscal rule of a government in one level lead to a fiscal response by a government in a different level? The literature focused primarily on the standard common-pool problem, while giving little attention to the potential role of complementarity or substitutability (CS) between the public goods supplied by the two governments. This paper fills this gap by focusing on the latter channel. First, we illustrate its potential key role in determining the sign of the vertical reaction through a generic model of vertical fiscal interactions. Second, we propose a novel strategy for identifying it, by considering an empirical design that confines the common-pool channel to specific locations. We implement this design through a quasi-natural experiment: the 1980 U.S. Crude Oil Windfall Act, which increased federal tax collections from sale of crude oil, thereby affecting the tax base of oil rich states specifically. This latter feature enables attributing the vertical fiscal reactions of the remaining states to the CS channel. Following this strategy, via a difference in-differences approach, we decompose the sources of the vertical fiscal reactions arising from this federal tax change and find that those attributed to the CS channel: (i) account for approximately 38% of the overall vertical fiscal response; (ii) point at complementarity between state and federal public goods, most notably in transportation and welfare expenditures; (iii) are manifested primarily via changes in states' sales and income taxation.","[Perez-Sebastian, Fidel] Univ Alicante, FAE, Alicante, Spain; [Perez-Sebastian, Fidel] Hull Univ, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Raveh, Ohad] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Jerusalem, Israel; [Raveh, Ohad] Ctr Agr Econ Res, Jerusalem, Israel; [Raveh, Ohad] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Property, Perth, WA, Australia",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Hull; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Curtin University,"Raveh, O (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Jerusalem, Israel.",fidel.perez@ua.es; ohad.raveh@mail.huji.ac.il,"Perez-Sebastian, Fidel/AAA-5832-2019",,Center for Agricultural Economic Research; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [ECO2015-70540-P MINECO/FEDER],Center for Agricultural Economic Research; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Union (EU)),"We thank David Agrawal, Ziv Bar-Shira, Thushyanthan Baskaran, Julie Cullen, Israel Finkelshtain, Yaniv Reingewertz, Gerhard Toews, Tony Venables, and seminar participants at the Bank of Israel, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and University of Oxford for helpful comments and suggestions.

For such portfolio structures, plausibly arising in the context of reinsurance, he defines a distortion-type risk measure that facilitates assessment of ceded and net losses with reference to gross portfolio outcomes. Subsequently, Major (2018) derives explicit formulas for Euler allocations for this risk measure, thus (sub-)allocating ceded losses to the portfolio's original components. In this comment, we build on Major's (2018) insights but take a somewhat different direction, to consider Euler capital allocations for distortion risk measures directly applied to homogeneous portfolios. Explicit formulas are derived and our approach is compared with that of Major (2018) via a numerical example. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier By.

Evidence from the 1994 Swedish pension reform,JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Education, Occupation; Pension; Reform; Retirement",RETIREMENT; EMPLOYMENT; INCREASE,"This paper investigates whether the Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) scheme prolongs working life. The evidence from the 1994 Swedish pension reform shows a gender and socio-economic gradient in the labor supply responses to phasing in NDC. While the reform exerted a large and significant positive effect on the average retirement age among highly educated and skilled, it had little or negative effect on those with low level of human capital. And the overall effect is more profound among older men, compared to older women. These findings imply that the aggregate impact of NDC may only be positive if the average level of older workers' education and skills is high, whereas it may be moderate (or even adverse) if the majority of the older workers are less educated and engage in low-skill jobs. This highlights the importance of incorporating the gender and socio-economic aspects into the evaluation of how a multi-pillar pension scheme, such as NDC, may increase the average working life expectancy.

Because of their increasing importance in informing the design of health products and services, it is critical to understand the extent to which DCEs give reliable predictions outside of the experimental context. We systematically reviewed the literature of published DCE studies comparing predictions to choices made in reality; we extracted individual-level data to estimate a bivariate mixed-effects model of pooled sensitivity and specificity. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and six of these gave sufficient data for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were 88% (95% CI 81, 92%) and 34% (95% CI 23, 46%), respectively, and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.60 (95% CI 0.55, 0.64).

In its attempt to synthesize and render accessible to social actors a broad range of the latest social scientific knowledge, as well as in its confidence that knowledge can empower those actors to make progress, it recalls D'Alembert and Diderot's famous Encyclopedie. Indeed, one can say that the Report is a quintessential Enlightenment project (cf. Bury 1920). For example, in his famous Outlines of a Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind (1796), Condorcet asserts the possibility of an accumulation of empirical and theoretical knowledge and the concomitant expansion in our capacities to alleviate social and natural evils. And Condorcet and many of his contemporaries were motivated to propose political institutions that would enable such an indefinite increase in knowledge so as to bring about the attendant improvement to people's lives.","[Raubo, Alexander] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RH, England; [Voorhoeve, Alex] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Raubo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RH, England.",ar948@cam.ac.uk; a.e.voorhoeve@lse.ac.uk,,,LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund,LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund,We are grateful to the LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund for supporting the workshop.

However, little is known about delays within the mental health service system and its impact on patients. We explore the impact of waiting times on patient outcomes in the context of early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services in England from April 2012 to March 2015. We use the Mental Health Services Data Set and the routine outcome measure the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. In a generalised linear regression model, we control for baseline outcomes, previous service use, and treatment intensity to account for possible endogeneity in waiting time. We find that longer waiting time is significantly associated with a deterioration in patient outcomes 12months after acceptance for treatment for patients that are still in EIP care. Effects are strongest for waiting times longer than 3months, and effect sizes are small to moderate. Patients with shorter treatment periods are not affected. The results suggest that policies should aim to reduce excessively long waits in order to improve outcomes for patients waiting for treatment for psychosis.","[Reichert, Anika; Jacobs, Rowena] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin Coll Block A, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Reichert, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin Coll Block A, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ar1314@york.ac.uk,,"Jacobs, Rowena/0000-0001-5225-6321","Centre for Health Economics, University of York","Centre for Health Economics, University of York","Anika Reichert conducted this research as part of her PhD study that is funded by a scholarship from the Centre for Health Economics, University of York.",,64,69,75,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27,11,,,,,1772,1787,,10.1002/hec.3800,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3800,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,30014544,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000446323300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a difference-indifference fixed effects specification, I find that after a village-level rainfall shock it is only users of mobile money who are able to prevent a drop in their consumption. There are no spillover effects to other members of the village. This finding has implications for how new technologies might change traditional risk sharing arrangements, and who might benefit and lose out from their spread.","[Riley, Emma] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Riley, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England.",emma.riley@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Riley, Emma/AHB-7347-2022","Riley, Emma/0000-0001-7644-8643",,,,,27,98,108,8,55,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Within this submission, they reported evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of etelcalcetide for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis. The Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC), part of the Wessex Institute at the University of Southampton, was the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) commissioned to appraise the company's submission. This article describes the ERG's review and critique of the company's submission and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in June 2017). The clinical-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company consisted of two double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing etelcalcetide with placebo, one RCT comparing etelcalcetide with cinacalcet, two single-arm extension studies of the above trials, and one single-arm study evaluating the effect of switching from cinacalcet to etelcalcetide. No study specifically examined the population specified in the NICE appraisal scope: patients refractory to standard therapy with phosphate binders and vitamin D (PBVD). None of these trials were designed to collect long-term efficacy data for outcomes such as mortality, bone fractures, cardiovascular events, or parathyroidectomies. Instead, biomarker data from the trials were mapped to long-term outcomes by an assumed linear relationship between the trial outcome, reduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by > 30%, and the log-hazard ratios for the occurrence of clinical events derived from a large, long-term RCT of cinacalcet (the EVOLVE trial). After submission of a confidential Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount reducing etelcalcetide drug costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet was 14,778 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the company's base case. While this value is lower than the NICE threshold range of 20,000 pound and 30,000 pound per QALY gained, it was the opinion of the ERG that the ICER was highly uncertain due to efficacy data limitations for etelcalcetide, inadequate synthesis of clinical-effectiveness evidence, and strong assumptions connecting short-term biomarker data with long-term clinical outcomes. The ERG produced an alternative base case for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet, with an ICER of 22,400 pound per QALY gained, also subject to uncertainty. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended etelcalcetide as an option for the treatment of SHPT in adults with CKD only if treatment with a calcimimetic is indicated and cinacalcet is not suitable, subject to the company's provision of the agreed PAS discount.","[Rose, Micah; Shepherd, Jonathan; Harris, Petra; Pickett, Karen; Lord, Joanne] Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Shepherd, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England.",jps@southampton.ac.uk,"; Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011","Pickett, Karen/0000-0002-8631-6465; Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624; Shepherd, Jonathan/0000-0003-1682-4330",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program [16/10/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program,"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program (project number 16/10/01 STA) [see the NIHR Journals Library website for further information-https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/#/].

Using panel data (pre- and post-refugee inflow) from Kagera, a rural region of Tanzania, we find that the refugee shock led to women being less likely to engage in employment outside the household and more likely to engage in household chores relative to men. This is probably the result of the environmental degradation that accompanied the arrival of refugees and the additional competition for natural resources such as wood and water. However, the results differ by (pre-shock) literacy and math skill. For women who could read and perform simple written mathematical operations the refugee shock resulted in a higher likelihood of engaging in outside employment. In contrast, higher exposure to the refugee shock resulted in illiterate women being more likely to engage in farming and household chores.","[Ruiz, Isabel] Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TD, England; [Vargas-Silva, Carlos] Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Ruiz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TD, England.",isabel.ruiz@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Ruiz, Isabel/AAG-4308-2022; Ruiz, Isabel/ACI-7611-2022","Ruiz, Isabel/0000-0002-8195-4943",UNU-WIDER,UNU-WIDER,This paper has received support from UNU-WIDER.,,57,12,12,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We develop an analytical model of two-stage production processes that can be distributed between two countries and investigate unilateral emission pricing and its supplementation with border carbon taxes. In contrast to existing final good models, we are able to show how impacts of regulation differ across the different stages of the supply chain, depending on the interplay of comparative advantages and general equilibrium effects. To get a more comprehensive picture, we subsequently apply a computable general equilibrium model that includes a representation of international supply chains. We find heterogeneous but mostly positive effects of a unilateral carbon emission reduction by the European Union on the degree of vertical specialization of European industries.

This period has received considerable attention in relation to the development of the British Empire, but little is known about how merchants and other commercial actors invested in and contributed to these organizations. Using a newly developed dataset of membership and investment in overseas activities, this article reconstructs the individual portfolios of East India Company members in 1599, 1613, and 1624. This analysis reveals that investors took advantage of opportunities across the globe, and diverse portfolios were common. The implications of this are two-fold. First, this article makes clear that our current understanding of the East India Company as closely connected with the Levant Company is not sustained with evidence from investment patterns. Second, the interests of London's commercial community suggest new avenues for understanding the early British Empire as a tightly connected, globally focused set of institutions, people, and networks.","[Smith, Edmond] Univ Kent, Ctr Polit Econ Int Commerce, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Smith, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Ctr Polit Econ Int Commerce, Canterbury, Kent, England.",E.J.Smith@kent.ac.uk,"Smith, Edmond/DJX-1860-2022","Smith, Edmond/0000-0002-8330-5218",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Catia Antunes, Richard Blakemore, D'Maris Coffman, William O'Reilly, Philip Stern, and Phil Withington all read versions of this material and offered valuable guidance-thank you all.

The DNL defines the so-called network delay operator, which maps a set of path departure rates to a set of path travel times (or costs). It is widely known that the delay operator is not available in closed form, and has undesirable properties that severely complicate DTA analysis and computation, such as discontinuity, non-differentiability, non-monotonicity, and computational inefficiency. This paper proposes a fresh take on this important and difficult issue, by providing a class of surrogate DNL models based on a statistical learning method known as Kriging. We present a metamodeling framework that systematically approximates DNL models and is flexible in the sense of allowing the modeler to make trade-offs among model granularity, complexity, and accuracy. It is shown that such surrogate DNL models yield highly accurate approximations (with errors below 8%) and superior computational efficiency (9 to 455 times faster than conventional DNL procedures such as those based on the link transmission model). Moreover, these approximate DNL models admit closed-form and analytical delay operators, which are Lipschitz continuous and infinitely differentiable, with closed form Jacobians. We provide in-depth discussions on the implications of these properties to DTA research and model applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Expansionary open-market operations generate a negative wealth effect, increasing households' incentives to save and pushing down the real interest rate. This leads to a substitution towards durables, generating a temporary boom in the durable-good sector. With search and matching frictions, the fall in interest rates causes an increase in labor demand, raising aggregate employment.

Overall, a parsimonious Vector Heterogeneous Autoregressive (VHAR) model that involves lagged daily, weekly and monthly realised covariances achieves the best performance out of the competing models. A promising new simple hybrid covariance estimator is developed that exploits option-implied information and high-frequency data while adjusting for the volatility riskpremium.

When the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) methodology is applied, the estimated total connectedness index is 5.08%, suggesting a low level of connection among the four markets. Furthermore, the results show that the stock and CDS markets are net transmitters of volatility, while foreign exchange and bond markets are net receivers of the spillovers. When the Barunik and Krehlik (2018) frequency-domain analysis is carried out, the results indicate, first, that at higher frequencies, the degree of connectedness increases, and, second, that the net transmitter of volatility spillovers across the markets is contingent on the frequency under consideration.

In order to identify the feasibility of utilising crop residues as bioenergy feedstock, a postal survey was conducted to determine current farm business wheat straw use, destination and potential future supply. The survey responses showed a bias towards larger, more commercially-minded farms, therefore capturing a large area of straw production. Results demonstrated a wide range of responses to both current straw use and potential for the supply of straw to different markets in the future. Interestingly, even for a very generous payment for straw, 28.5% of straw currently chopped and incorporated would not be sold, suggesting that straw supply for bioenergy feedstock is likely to be more limited than previously assumed. However, higher prices for straw would encourage farmers to explore ways of increasing straw yield.","[Townsend, T. J.; Sparkes, D. L.; Ramsden, S. J.; Glithero, N.

Third, resource wars are more intense if constitutional cohesiveness is weak, the incumbent has a partisan in-office bias, reserves of resources are high, the wage is low, governments can be less frequently removed from office, and fighting technology has less decreasing returns to scale.

However, a general problem in transport modelling is that these variables are subject to measurement errors in transport network models. In this paper we show how to assess the magnitude of the measurement errors in travel time and travel cost by latent variables, in a large-scale travel demand model. The case study for Stockholm commuters shows that assuming multiplicative measurement errors for travel time and cost result in a better fit than additive ones, and that parameter estimates of the choice model are impacted by some of the key modelling assumptions. Moreover, our results suggest that measurement errors in our dataset are larger for the travel cost than for the travel time, and that measurement errors are larger in self-reported travel time than software-calculated travel time for car-driver and car-passenger, and of similar magnitude for public transport. Among self-reported travel times, car-passenger has the largest errors, followed by car-driver and public transport, and for the software-calculated times, public transport exhibits larger errors than car. These errors, if not corrected, lead to biases in measures derived from the models, such as elasticities and values of travel time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Internal adjustment to these changes has often proved to be extremely slow and painful. This paper combines elements of urban and international economics to draw out the implications of trade shocks for city performance. Localization economies in production of internationally tradable goods mean that cities divide into two types, those producing tradables and those specializing in sectors producing just for the national market (nontradables). Negative trade shocks (and possibly also some positive ones) reduce the number of cities engaged in tradable production, increasing the number producing just nontradables. This has a negative effect across all nontradable cities, which lose population and land value. Remaining tradable cities boom, gaining population and land value. Depending on the initial position, city size dispersion may increase, thus raising the share of urban land rents in national income and reducing the share of labor.","[Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Int Growth Ctr, London, England",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,12,6,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we focus on one of the drawbacks of the Poisson Lee-Carter model (Brouhns et al., 2002) that imposes mean-variance equality, restricting mortality variations across individuals. Specifically, we present two models to potentially account for overdispersion. We propose to fit these models within the Bayesian framework for various advantages, but primarily for coherency. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are implemented to carry out parameter estimation. Several comparisons are made with the Bayesian Poisson Lee-Carter model (Czado et al., 2005) to highlight the importance of accounting for overdispersion. We demonstrate that the methodology we developed prevents over-fitting and yields better calibrated prediction intervals for the purpose of mortality projections. Bridge sampling is used to approximate the marginal likelihood of each candidate model to compare the models quantitatively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wong, Jackie S.

We introduce dynamic congestion effect into commuters' departure-time and mode choice behaviours, and analyse the endogenous interactions between their travel and residential relocation choices. Studies ignoring dynamic departure-time behaviour show an ambiguous effect of transit improvements to the city. However, we find that transit improvement has a definitive impact on city structure: it increases the residents' equilibrium utility, at a cost of increased suburb land use.

This paper explains the relationship between this dual limit theory by showing how the asymptotic forms are linked in terms of joint and sequential limits. In one case, joint asymptotics apply when both the sample size diverges and the threshold effect shrinks to zero, whereas sequential asymptotics operate in the other case in which the sample size diverges first and the threshold effect shrinks subsequently. The two operations lead to the same limit distribution, thereby linking the two different cases. The proofs make use of ideas involving limit theory for sums of a random number of summands.

A considerable body of literature argues that if more freight could be carried on the rail network, substantial reductions in carbon footprints could be made. This paper describes a modelling framework for estimating the spatial transfer or movement of aggregates between quarries in England and Wales and local authority districts (demand zones). A key part of this framework is the estimation of the carbon emissions associated with both road and rail travel. Once built and calibrated, the model is used for a variety of what-if scenarios relating to the increased use of rail (which includes the necessary construction of new uplifting facilities as well as the number of rail-linked quarries) against future road haulage undertaken through a modernised vehicle fleet. The latter is shown to provide a more realistic and economic solution to reducing carbon emissions associated with the transportation of aggregates.","[Zuo, Chengchoa] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Chengchoa; Birkin, Mark; Clarke, Graham] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [McEvoy, Fiona; Bloodworth, Andrew] British Geol Survey, Nottingham NG12 5GG, England",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey,"Clarke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.p.clarke@leeds.ac.uk,"Zuo, Chengchao/AAT-8686-2021","Zuo, Chengchao/0000-0002-1419-7989; Birkin, Mark/0000-0001-5991-098X",BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662016QD019]; ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [bgs05010] Funding Source: UKRI,BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was supported by the BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship, and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under project 2662016QD019.",,40,17,17,9,62,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Through an examination of the ways in which labor regimes are constituted as a result of the articulation of local social relations and lead-firm pressure in GPNs, the article examines the limits of labor provisions in European Union trade policy seeking to ameliorate the worst consequences of trade liberalization and economic integration on working conditions. The article takes as its empirical focus the Moldovan clothing industry, the leading export-oriented manufacturing sector in the country. Trade liberalization has opened up a market space for EU lead firms to contract with Moldovan-based suppliers, but in seeking to regulate labor conditions in the process of trade liberalization, the mechanisms in place are not sufficient to deal with the consequences for workers' rights and working conditions. Indeed, when articulated with national state policy formulations seeking to liberalize labor markets and deregulate labor standards, the limits of what can be achieved via labor provisions are reached. The EU's trade policy formulation does not sufficiently take account of the structural causes of poor working conditions. Consequently, there is a mismatch between what the EU is trying to achieve and the core labor issues that structure social relations in, and labor regimes of, low-wage labor-intensive clothing export production for EU markets.","[Smith, Adrian] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Barbu, Mirela; Campling, Liam] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England; [Harrison, James] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Richardson, Ben] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England.",a.m.smith@qmul.ac.uk; m.barbu@qmul.ac.uk; l.campling@qmul.ac.uk; J.Harrison.3@warwick.ac.uk; B.J.Richardson@warwick.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009343/1]; ESRC [ES/M009343/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article arises from research undertaken as part of a UK Economic and Social Research Council-funded project entitled Working Beyond the Border: European Union Trade Agreements and Labour Standards (award number: ES/M009343/1).

Industrial development is defined as a shift from an imitation-based, low-skill economy to an innovation-based, high-skill economy, where ideas are produced domestically. Imitation generates knowledge spillovers, which enhance productivity in innovation. Changes in industrial structure are measured by the ratio of the variety of imitation- to innovation-based intermediate goods. The model also distinguishes between basic infrastructure, which helps to promote learning by doing and productivity in imitation activities, and advanced infrastructure, which promotes knowledge networks and innovation. Numerical experiments, based on a parameterized version for a stylized low-income country, show that changes in the level and composition of public investment in infrastructure may have significant effects on the structure of the labour force and the process of industrial development.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Alpaslan, Baris] Univ Ankara, Social Sci, Ankara, Turkey",University of Manchester; Ankara University,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Pierre-Richard.Agenor@manchester.ac.uk,"Alpaslan, Baris/A-3541-2017","Alpaslan, Baris/0000-0002-7908-1557; Agenor, Pierre-Richard/0000-0001-5720-3544",,,,,33,7,7,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Using data for 20 industrial countries over the period 1970Q1-2012Q2 and a discrete-time Weibull duration model, we find that the likelihood of the end of a housing boom or a housing bust increases over time. Additionally, we show that the different phases of the housing market cycle are strongly dependent on the economic activity, but credit market conditions are particularly important in the case of housing booms. The empirical findings also indicate that although housing booms have similar lengths in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries. The use of a more flexible specification for the hazard function that is based on cubic splines suggests that it evolves in a nonlinear way. From a policy perspective, our study can be useful for predicting the timing and the length of housing boom-bust cycles. Moreover, it highlights the importance of monetary policy by influencing lending rates and affecting the likelihood of occurrence of housing booms.","[Agnello, Luca] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Castro, Vitor] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor; Sousa, Ricardo M.] NIPE, Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Palermo; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Minho; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sousa, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ & Econ Policies Res Unit, NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",rjsousa@eeg.uminho.pt,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Castro, Vitor/D-3812-2018; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753","Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268 (PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013), SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; COMPTE; QREN; FEDER",Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); COMPTE; QREN; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to participants to the 2nd International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics (FMND), organized in Paris on June 4-5, 2015 (http://www.fmnd.fr), the Guest Editor, Fredj Jawadi, and Philip Rothman for their constructive comments and suggestions that considerably improved this paper.

Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants.","[Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery; Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Pos Grad Ecol, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hawes, Joseph E.] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Biol, Appl Ecol Res Grp, East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; [Newton, Peter] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Sustainabil Energy & Environm Community, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Feltran-Barbieri, Rafael] World Resources Inst WRI Brasil, Rua Claudio Soares 72, BR-05422030 Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of East Anglia; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Anglia Ruskin University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Alves-Pinto, HN (通讯作者)，Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",h.alves-pinto@iis-rio.org,"Peres, Carlos Augusto/N-8275-2019; Peres, Carlos A./ABE-8361-2020","Peres, Carlos A./0000-0002-1588-8765; Hawes, Joseph/0000-0003-0053-2018; Newton, Peter/0000-0002-3992-0483",DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) [16-001]; Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK); Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),"This study was funded by a DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) grant (Ref. 16-001) to CAP, and supported by internal funding from Anglia Ruskin University to JEH.

We find that the winners of these randomly assigned initial public offering (IPO) lottery shares are significantly more likely to hold them than lottery losers 1, 6, and even 24 months after the random allocation. This finding strongly evokes laboratory findings of an endowment effect for risky gambles, and persists in samples of highly active investors, suggesting along with additional evidence that this behaviour is not driven by inertia alone. The effect decreases as experience in the IPO market increases, but remains even for very experienced investors. Leading theories of the endowment effect based on reference-dependent preferences are unable to fully explain these and other findings in the data.","[Anagol, Santosh] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Balasubramaniam, Vimal] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ramadorai, Tarun] Imperial Coll, London, England; [Ramadorai, Tarun] CEPR, London, England",University of Pennsylvania; University of Warwick; Imperial College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Anagol, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Ramadorai, Tarun/ABF-2035-2020","Ramadorai, Tarun/0000-0002-4145-205X",Alfred P.

We repeatedly observe the decision making of individual professional baseball umpires, quasi-randomly assigned to varying air quality across time and space. Unique characteristics of this setting combined with high-frequency data disentangle effects of multiple pollutants and identify previously underexplored acute effects. We find that a 1 ppm increase in 3-hour CO causes an 11.5% increase in the propensity of umpires to make incorrect calls and a 10 g/m(3) increase in 12-hour PM2.5 causes a 2.6% increase. We control carefully for a variety of potential confounders, and results are supported by robustness and falsification checks. Our estimates imply that a 3% reduction in productive output is associated with a change in CO concentrations equivalent to moving from the 25th to the 95th percentile of the CO distribution in many of the largest US cities.","[Archsmith, James] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2200 Symons Hall,7889 Regents Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Heyes, Anthony] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Heyes, Anthony] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Saberian, Soodeh] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, 501 Fletcher Argue Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Ottawa; University of Sussex; University of Manitoba,"Archsmith, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2200 Symons Hall,7889 Regents Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",archsmith@econjim.com,"Archsmith, James/AAB-2343-2020","Heyes, Anthony/0000-0003-1847-9374; Archsmith, James/0000-0002-6052-0302","UC Davis Office of Graduate Studies, College of Letters and Science: Division of Social Sciences; UC Davis Department of Economics; CRC Program","UC Davis Office of Graduate Studies, College of Letters and Science: Division of Social Sciences; UC Davis Department of Economics; CRC Program(Canada Research Chairs)","He is grateful for financial support from the UC Davis Office of Graduate Studies, College of Letters and Science: Division of Social Sciences; and the UC Davis Department of Economics.

These tests are designed to be asymptotically robust to the order of integration of the series at both the zero and seasonal frequencies. Motivated by the approach of Hylleberg, Engle, Granger and Yoo, we base our approach on linear filters of the data that remove any potential unit roots at the frequencies not associated with the deterministic component(s) under test. Test statistics are constructed using the filtered data such that they have well defined limiting null distributions regardless of whether the data are either integrated or stationary at the frequency associated with the deterministic component(s) under test. In the same manner as Vogelsang, Bunzel and Vogelsang and Sayginsoy and Vogelsang, we scale these statistics by a function of an auxiliary seasonal unit root statistic. This allows us to construct tests that are asymptotically robust to the order of integration of the data at both the zero and seasonal frequencies. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that our proposed tests have good finite sample size and power properties. An empirical application to UK gross domestic product indicates the presence of seasonal mean shifts in the data.","[Astill, S.; Taylor, A. M.

Considering competition between two groups of different size, we show that the small group's sharing rule is a strategic complement to the large group's sharing rule in the sense that if the small group chooses a more meritocratic sharing rule, the large group wishes to choose a more meritocratic rule as well. On the contrary, the large group's sharing rule is a strategic substitute to the small group's sharing rule, hence the timing of choice is crucial. For sufficiently private prizes, a switch from a simultaneous choice to the small group being the leader consists in a Pareto improvement and reduces aggregate effort. On the contrary, when the large group is the leader, aggregate effort increases. As a result, the equilibrium timing is such that the small group chooses its sharing rule first. If the prize is not private enough, the small group retires from the competition and switching from a simultaneous to a sequential timing may reverse the results in terms of aggregate effort. The sequential timing also guarantees that the small group never outperforms the large one.","[Balart, Pau] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Guertler, Oliver] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Troumpounis, Orestis] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Cologne; Lancaster University,"Balart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain.",pau.balart@uib.cat; sabine.flamand@urv.cat; oliver.guertler@unikoeln.de; o.troumpounis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Gürtler, Oliver/AAX-6418-2021; Balart, Pau/I-4213-2019","Gürtler, Oliver/0000-0001-7792-5325; Balart, Pau/0000-0002-9088-537X; Troumpounis, Orestis/0000-0003-1074-863X","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO201786305-C4-1-R, ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant/Award Numbers ECO201786305-C4-1-R (AEI/ERDF, EU), ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P",,52,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In Brazil, antipsychotic drugs and outpatient and hospital services are provided by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) for patients with schizophrenia. However, few studies capture the cost of managing these patients within the Brazilian NHS. This is important to appraise different management approaches within universal healthcare systems. Our objective was to use real-world data to describe the costs associated with the treatment of schizophrenia in adults receiving atypical antipsychotics in Brazil from 2000 to 2010. We integrated three national databases for adult patients with schizophrenia receiving one or more atypical antipsychotics. We assessed only direct medical costs and the study was conducted from a public-payer perspective. A multivariate log-linear regression model was performed to evaluate associations between costs and clinical and demographic variables. We identified 174,310 patients with schizophrenia, with mean +/- standard deviation (SD) annual costs of $US1811.92 +/- 284.39 per patient. Atypical antipsychotics accounted for 79.7% of total costs, with a mean annual cost per patient of $US1578.74 +/- 240.40. Mean annual costs per patient were $US2482.90 +/- 302.92 for psychiatric hospitalization and $US862.96 +/- 160.18 for outpatient psychiatric care. Olanzapine was used by 47.7% of patients and represented 62.8% of the total costs of atypical antipsychotics. Patients who used clozapine had the highest mean annual cost per patient for outpatient psychiatric care and psychiatric hospitalization. Atypical antipsychotics were responsible for the majority of the schizophrenia treatment costs, and psychiatric hospitalization costs were the highest mean annual cost per patient.

Subjective probabilities are mathematically realized in the framework of quantum probability (QP). Utility functions are borrowed from the classical decision theory. But in the model they are represented not only by their values. Heuristically one can say that each value ui u(x(i)) is surrounded by a cloud of information related to the event (A, x(i)). An agent processes this information by using the rules of quantum information and QP. This process is very complex; it combines counterfactual reasoning for comparison between preferences for different outcomes of lotteries which are in general complementary. These comparisons induce interference type effects (constructive or destructive). The decision process is mathematically represented by the comparison operator and the outcome of this process is determined by the sign of the value of corresponding quadratic form on the belief state. This operational process can be decomposed into a few subprocesses. Each of them can be formally treated as a comparison of subjective expected utilities and interference factors (the latter express, in particular, risks related to lottery selection). The main aim of this paper is to analyze the mathematical structure of these processes in the most general situation: representation of lotteries by noncommuting operators. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The twentieth century witnessed significant male female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women 'looking more like men'? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016.

To tease apart the effect of the shock and the inequality, we compare behavior in a trust game where the inequality is initially given and one where it is the result of a random shock that reduces the second mover's endowment. We find that first-movers send less to second-movers but only when the inequality results from a random shock.

Using Bass's model and Bemmaor's Gamma/Shifted Gompertz (G/SG) model, they found evidence of a left skew in the right-censored distributions of the times to adoption in three countries out of four. However, this conclusion relied on the skewness parameter of Bemmaor's model. We reanalyze the data, making use of three special cases of the G/SG as well as the full version. Extending the data set to six countries, we show that (i) fitting the four models to the data does not allow us to discriminate between models, but (ii) forecasting the subsequent adoptions provides a strong support of right skewness in the data set: each country (except France) shows a substantial mass of later adopters of mobile social networking following an initial embrace of the access.

The betweenness axiom is a weaker version of the independence axiom of expected utility theory. Numerous empirical studies documented systematic violations of the betweenness axiom in revealed individual choice under uncertainty. This paper shows that these systematic violations can be linked to another behavioral regularity-choice shifts in a group decision making. Choice shifts are observed if an individual faces the same decision problem but makes a different choice when deciding alone and in a group.","[Blavatskyy, Pavlo R.] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France; [Feri, Francesco] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham, Surrey, England",Montpellier Business School; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Blavatskyy, PR (通讯作者)，Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France.",p.blavatskyy@montpellier-bs.com; Francesco.Feri@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85,3-4,,,,,321,331,,10.1007/s11238-018-9664-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-018-9664-x,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000448446600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

With uncertainty, the allocation of goods and time over the life cycle also serves the purpose of smoothing marginal utility in response to shocks. Combining data on consumption, wages, hours of work, and time spent with children, we compute the sensitivity of consumption and time allocation to transitory and permanent wage shocks. We find that family labor supply responses depend on three counteracting forces: complementarity of leisure time, substitutability of time in the production of child services, and added worker effects.","[Blundell, Richard; Saporta-Eksten, Itay] UCL, London, England; [Blundell, Richard] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Stanford University; Tel Aviv University,"Blundell, R (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Blundell, R (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299",UK Economic and Social Research Council Research Centre at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Economic Research Center grant MicroConLab; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council Research Centre at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Economic Research Center grant MicroConLab; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor and referees, participants at the Becker Memorial Conference at the University of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and the 2017 Macro-Micro Conference in Oslo for helpful comments.

Part of this has been a rise in far-right, anti-immigration parties in a range of countries. Existing evidence suggests that the presence of immigrants generates an advantage for parties with anti-immigration or nationalist platforms. This paper explores a closely related but overlooked issue: how immigrant behaviour is influenced by these parties. We focus on immigrant location decisions in Northern Italy, an area that has seen the rise of the anti-immigration party Lega Nord. We construct a dataset of mayoral elections in Italy for the years 2002-2014 and estimate the effect of electing a mayor belonging to, or supported by, Lega Nord. Exploiting close elections in a regression discontinuity framework we demonstrate that the election of a Lega Nord mayor discourages immigrants from moving into the municipality. We also provide suggestive evidence that the effect is driven primarily by the anti-immigration politics of Lega Nord insofar as it is absent in the period before their adoption of an explicitly anti-immigration platform and is concentrated in smaller, less educated, municipalities.

Our analysis shows that, among the women studied, those whose own mothers are retirement eligible have a 11% higher probability of being in the labor force than those whose mothers are ineligible. The pension eligibility of maternal grandfathers and paternal grandparents, however, has no significant effect on the women's labor force participation. We also demonstrate that the eligibility of maternal grandmothers mainly captures the effect of their availability for childcare. Hence, pension reforms, by potentially robbing households of an important source of flexible, low-cost childcare, could have unintended negative consequences for the employment rates of women with young children.","[Bratti, Massimiliano] European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] Univ Milan, DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bratti, Massimiliano; Frattini, Tommaso] LdA, Milan, Italy; [Frattini, Tommaso] CReAM, London, England; [Frattini, Tommaso] Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Frattini, Tommaso] CEPR, London, England; [Scervini, Francesco] Univ Pavia, DSPS, Corso Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Milan; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Pavia,"Bratti, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Bratti, M (通讯作者)，LdA, Milan, Italy.",massimiliano.bratti@unimi.it; tommaso.frattini@unimi.it; francesco.scervini@unipv.it,"Bratti, Massimiliano/J-6811-2012","Bratti, Massimiliano/0000-0002-4565-6260; FRATTINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9844-881X; SCERVINI, Francesco/0000-0001-6403-5876",,,,,40,30,34,5,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We relate the development of the sex industry to an early temporary demand shock, that is, US military presence during the Vietnam War. Comparing the surroundings of Thai military bases used by the US army to districts close to unused Thai bases, we find that there are currently five times more commercial sex workers in districts near former US bases. The development of the sex industry is also explained by a high price elasticity of supply due to female migration from regions affected by an agricultural crisis. Finally, we study a consequence induced by the large numbers of sex workers in few red-light districts: the HIV outbreak in the early 1990s.

Using a new dataset on tax revenues for 130 countries between 1792 and 2006, we identify ninety-nine episodes of trade liberalization defined as a large fall in trade tax revenues not accompanied by a decrease in trade. Seven took place before World War One, seven in the interwar period, eighteen in the Bretton Woods period and the remainder after 1970. We examine the extent to which countries were able to recover the tax revenues lost by liberalizing trade by using other sources of revenue. We find that historical (pre-1970) trade liberalization episodes were unlikely to be accompanied by decreases in tax revenues, especially during the Bretton Woods era. In the recent period however, over 40% of the developing countries in our sample experience a fall in total tax revenues that lasts more than ten years after an episode of trade liberalization. Overall, trade liberalization led to larger and longer-lived declines in tax revenues in developing countries since 1970 than in today's rich countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Results are similar when we consider government expenditures, suggesting decreases in trade tax revenues negatively affect governments' capacity to provide public services in many developing countries.","[Cage, Julia] Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Cage, Julia; Gadenne, Lucie] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Gadenne, Lucie] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Warwick,"Cagé, J (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.;Cagé, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",julia.cage@sciencespo.fr; l.gadenne@warwick.ac.uk,"Cagé, Julia/AAA-1522-2019","Cagé, Julia/0000-0001-7085-5774",ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,93,55,57,1,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

P.; Schivardi, Fabiano",,,The productivity puzzle and misallocation: an Italian perspective,ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FIRM-LEVEL; TRADE; CHINA; EFFICIENCY; IMPACT; PANEL; TFP,"Productivity has recently slowed down in many economies around the world. A crucial challenge in understanding what lies behind this 'productivity puzzle' is the still short time span for which data can be analysed. An exception is Italy, where productivity growth started to stagnate 25 years ago. The Italian case can therefore offer useful insights to understand the global productivity slowdown. We find that resource misallocation has played a sizeable role in slowing down Italian productivity growth. If misallocation had remained at its 1995 level, in 2013 Italy's aggregate productivity would have been 18% higher than its actual level. Misallocation has mainly risen within sectors rather than between them, increasing more in sectors where the world technological frontier has expanded faster. Relative specialization in those sectors explains the patterns of misallocation across geographical areas and firm size classes. The broader message is that an important part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle may lie in the rising difficulty of reallocating resources across firms within sectors where technology is changing faster rather than between sectors with different speeds of technological change.","[Calligaris, Sara] OECD, Paris, France; EIEF, Rome, Italy; Univ G dAnnunzio, Pescara, Italy; CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; Bank Italy, CEP, Rome, Italy; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Bocconi Milan CEP, Milan, Italy; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; LUISS, EIEF, Rome, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Luiss Guido Carli University,"Calligaris, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,"Hassan, Fadi/AAL-2047-2021; Del Gatto, Massimo/ABG-4159-2021","Del Gatto, Massimo/0000-0002-3261-8038",Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor Tommaso Monacelli, four anonymous referees, and our discussants, Alberto Martin and Kurt Mitman, for detailed feedback that greatly improved the paper.

Second, we show how to estimate the model that deals with unbalanced panels of data and mixed frequencies, and examine the benefits of this extension through several Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we assess its empirical reliability for the computation of real-time inferences of the US business cycle, and compare it with the alternative method of forecasting the probabilities of recession from balanced panels.

We document a gender gap in criminal activities, based on property crimes, using data from the U.S. National Incident Based Reporting System from 1995 to 2015. We show that there is a gender participation gap, with only 30 percent of the crimes being committed by females. We try to explain the gender participation gap by focusing on incentives to commit crime, such as criminal earnings and probability of arrest. We show that on average females earn 13% less than males while they face a 9% lower likelihood of arrest. We find that males respond more to changes in illegal earnings, with an elasticity of 0.36, while females are less responsive with an elasticity of 0.23. Both genders respond equally to changes in the probability of arrest, with an elasticity around -0.14. Using a Blinder-Oaxaca type decomposition technique, we find that differences in incentives explain about 8 % of the gender participation gap, while differences in responsiveness to changes in incentives, especially illegal earnings, explain about 56% of the gap. The fact that females behave differently than males has implications for the heterogeneity in response to crime control policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Such policy style amends and enriches the new mission-oriented framework for innovation policy by assigning more weight to the microeconomic dimension of private actors' actions and by being more concerned with the temporary nature of interventions. We relate our argument to recent empirical trends in productivity dynamics and innovative activities. These suggest that an innovation slowdown is taking place and, consequently, that a renewed interest in the (re-)direction-rather than on the intensity of innovative activities-is key to the design of R&I policy capable to tackle current challenges. We use the evidence to build a schematic theoretical framework to inform policy design, and we outlined the defining features of our proposed policy style.","[Cantner, Uwe] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Vannuccini, Simone] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Business Sch, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark; University of Sussex,"Cantner, U (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.;Cantner, U (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",uwe.cantner@uni-jena.de; S.Vannuccini@sussex.ac.uk,"Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X; Vannuccini, Simone/0000-0001-7083-6178",,,,,61,16,18,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using unique longitudinal data, we estimate workers' vulnerability to income poverty and find a strong negative relationship between vulnerability and life satisfaction, over and above the positive income effect commonly documented in the literature. The result is robust and cannot be reduced to the effect of two-sided uncertainty. A matched behavioral experiment shows that respondents are significantly loss averse. We conclude that downside risk is an important determinant of happiness and of economic decisions under uncertainty.

Studying development strategies through spillover networks,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public policy; Development indicators; Behavioral game; Networks; Agent-based modeling; Sustainable development goals,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INSTITUTIONS; INFORMATION; SIMULATION; MODEL,"Determining policy priorities is a challenging task for any government because there may be, for example, a multiple objectives to be simultaneously attained, a multidimensional policy space to be explored, inefficiencies in the implementation of public policies, interdependencies between policy issues, etc. Altogether, these factors generate a complex landscape that governments need to navigate in order to reach their goals. To address this problem, we develop a framework to model the evolution of development indicators as a political economy game on a network. Our approach accounts for the-recently documented-network of interactions between policy issues, as well as the well-known political economy problem arising from budget assignment. This allows us to infer not only policy priorities, but also the effective use of resources in each policy issue. Using development indicators data from more than 100 countries over 11 years, we show that the country-specific context is a central determinant of the effectiveness of policy priorities. In addition, our model explains well-known aggregate facts about the relationship between corruption and development. Finally, this framework provides a new analytic tool to generate bespoke advice on development strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(2013) suggest a simple diagnostic indicator for the Bayesian estimation of the parameters of a DSGE model. They show that, if a parameter is well identified, the precision of the posterior should improve as the (artificial) data size T increases, and the indicator checks the speed at which precision improves. As it does not require any additional programming, a researcher just needs to generate artificial data and estimate the model with increasing sample size, T. We apply this indicator to the benchmark Smets and Wouters (2007) DSGE model of the US economy, and suggest how to implement this indicator on DSGE models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The actions representing other dimensions of the strategy space remain under the sovereign, individual control of the players. We consider a standard extension of the Nash equilibrium concept denoted as a partial cooperative equilibrium as well as an equilibrium concept in which the coalition of cooperators has a leadership position. Existence results are stated and we identify conditions under which the various equilibrium concepts are equivalent. We apply this framework to existing models of multi-market oligopolies and international pollution abatement. In a multi-market oligopoly, typically, a merger paradox emerges in the partial cooperative equilibrium. The paradox vanishes if the cartel attains a leadership position. For international pollution abatement treaties, cooperation by a sufficiently large group of countries results in a Pareto improvement over the standard tragedy of the commons outcome described by the Nash equilibrium.","[Chakrabarti, Subhadip; Gilles, Robert P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland; [Lazarova, Emiliya] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Queens University Belfast; University of East Anglia,"Lazarova, E (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",E.Lazarova@uea.ac.uk,"LAZAROVA, EMILIYA/AAI-6647-2020","Lazarova, Emiliya/0000-0002-7178-0644",,,,,31,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85,3-4,,,,,455,478,,10.1007/s11238-018-9666-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-018-9666-8,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000448446600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We document a significant reduction in market segmentation over time. While New York bond yields exceeded those in London in the 1870s, this premium disappeared by the early 1900s.

The literature also shows that the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal when the sample size of the original data considered goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, there is little discussion on the large sample behaviour of the posterior mean. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. In particular, we extend the posterior mean idea to the conditional mean case, which is conditioning on a given vector of summary statistics of the original data. We establish a new asymptotic theory for the conditional mean estimator for the case when both the sample size of the original data concerned and the number of Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations go to infinity. Simulation studies show that this conditional mean estimator has very good finite sample performance. In addition, we employ the conditional mean estimator to estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for S&P 500 stock returns and find that the conditional mean estimator performs better than quasi-maximum likelihood estimation in terms of out-of-sample forecasting.

Individuals start by choosing their investments in education anticipating returns in the marriage market and the labor market. They then match on the basis of the economic value of marriage and preferences. Equilibrium in the marriage market determines intrahousehold allocation of resources. Following marriage households (married or single) save, supply labor, and consume private and public commodities under uncertainty. Marriage thus has the dual role of providing public goods and offering risk sharing. The model is estimated using the British Household Panel Survey.","[Chiappori, Pierre-Andre] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dias, Monica Costa; Meghir, Costas] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Dias, Monica Costa] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Meghir, Costas] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Meghir, Costas] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meghir, Costas] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade do Porto; Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Chiappori, PA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Meghir, Costas/C-3370-2008","Costa-Dias, Monica/0000-0002-3882-4748","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N015304/1, ES/K00624X/1, ES/M010147/1]; Cowles Foundation; Institution for Social and Policy Studies; National Science Foudation [1124277]; ESRC [ES/N015304/1, ES/M010147/1, ES/K00624X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Cowles Foundation; Institution for Social and Policy Studies; National Science Foudation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has greatly benefited from discussions with Jim Heckman, Ana Reynoso, Jeremy Fox, Ilse Lindenlaub, Bob Polak, and Harald Uhlig.

We examine the impact of competition from these surgical centres on the efficiency - measured by pre-surgery length of stay for hip and knee replacement patients - and case mix of incumbent public hospitals. We exploit the fact that the government chose the broad locations where these surgical centres (Independent Sector Treatment Centres or ISTCs) would be built based on local patient waiting times - not length of stay or clinical quality - to construct treatment and control groups that are comparable with respect to key outcome variables of interest. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that the government-facilitated entry of surgical centres led to shorter pre-surgery length of stay at nearby public hospitals. However, these new entrants took on healthier patients and left incumbent hospitals treating patients who were sicker. This paper highlights a potential trade-off that policymakers face when they promote competition from private, for-profit firms in markets for the provision of public services. (C) 2018 The Authors.

(2009), we define and construct Granger-causality tail risk networks between 33 systemically important banks (G-SIBS) and 36 sovereign bonds worldwide. Our purpose is to exploit the structure of the Granger-causality tail risk networks to identify periods of distress in financial markets and possible channels of systemic risk propagation. Combining measures of connectedness of these networks with the ratings of the sovereign bonds, we propose a flight-to quality indicator to identify periods of turbulence in the market. Our measure clearly peaks at the onset of the European sovereign debt crisis, signaling the instability of the financial system. Finally, we use the connectedness measures of the networks to forecast the quality of sovereign bonds. We find that connectedness is a significant predictor of the cross-section of bond quality.

We analyse the impact of nationally regulated pay on the quality of applicants to be police officers across England and Wales, exploiting a unique dataset of individual test scores from the national assessment required of all police applicants, and combining this with data on local labour markets and policing conditions. National wage setting impacts on the quality of police applicants through two channels: first, through spatial variations in the relative wage of policing compared to other occupations, and second, because national wages cannot compensate for local variations in the disamenity of policing. We also provide preliminary evidence on whether police recruit quality is associated with police force performance.","[Crawford, Rowena; Disney, Richard] Univ Sussex, Univ Coll, Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of Sussex; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University College London,"Crawford, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Univ Coll, Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES L008 165/1]; ESRC [ES/L008165/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council through grant ES L008 165/1 to the Institute for Fiscal Studies for the project 'Economics of the police: recruitment, retention and finance'.

With a focus on storage assets and wider natural gas market exposures, we present a gas storage valuation methodology, which uniquely uses a flexible multifactor Levy process setting that allows for consistent valuation and risk management reporting across a general derivative book. Our approach is capable of replicating the complex covariance structure of the natural gas forward curve and capturing time spread volatility, a key driver of extrinsic storage value, while being simultaneously capable of accurately calibrating to market traded options. We begin by extending a single factor Mean Reverting Variance Gamma process to an arbitrary number of dimensions and, by way of specific examples, show how the traditional Principal Component Analysis based view of gas forward curve dynamics can be incorporated into a primarily market based valuation. We develop in the process an innovative implied moments based calibration technique, which allows for efficient calibration of general multifactor forward curve models to delivery period options common in energy and commodity markets. Furthermore, to accommodate the forward curve and traded options market consistency, we propose an appropriate joint market based calibration and historical estimation methodology. Through a formal model specification analysis, we provide evidence that the multifactor Levy models we propose provide a better joint fit to NBP natural gas options-forward market data, relative to comparative benchmark models. Finally, we develop a novel multidimensional fast Fourier transform based storage valuation algorithm and provide empirical evidence that the multifactor Levy model suite is better specified to more accurately capture extrinsic value.

Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016-2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.","[Dafermos, Yannis] Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nikolaidi, Maria] Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England; [Galanis, Giorgos] Goldsmiths Univ London, Inst Management Studies, London, England",University of West England; University of Greenwich; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Nikolaidi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Old Royal Naval Coll, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",M.Nikolaidi@greenwich.ac.uk,,"Nikolaidi, Maria/0000-0002-8188-5482; Dafermos, Yannis/0000-0002-8127-6249",Network for Social Change; University of the West of England,Network for Social Change; University of the West of England,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

When the contest success function takes a logit form, and marginal cost is increasing in effort, we show that a Nash equilibrium exists and is unique both in productive and destructive endogenous prize contests. In equilibrium, the underdog expends more resources to win the prize, but still his probability of winning remains below that of the favorite. In a productive contest, the underdog behaves more aggressively and wins the prize more often in comparison to a fixed-value contest.

J,"Datzberger, S",,,,"Datzberger, Simone",,,Why education is not helping the poor. Findings from Uganda,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; Poverty alleviation; Assimilation; Transformation; Uganda,JUSTICE,"Education emerged as a nearly uncontested development strategy to tackle several forms of social, political, economic and geographic inequalities in low- and middle-income countries. When it comes to the case of Uganda, the country represents a striking paradox. Significant investments and policy reforms in education (such as Universal Primary and Secondary Education) since 1997, did not translate into the expected results with regards to poverty reduction through human capital investment. Progress in poverty alleviation is not only stagnant but the role of education therein can be described as 'modest' at best. Against this backdrop, this article assesses the following research question: Why did Uganda's investments and policy reforms in education not uplift the poor? In examining the issue, this article introduces a theoretical framework that contrasts assimilative with transformative approaches in poverty alleviation through education. A rigorous review of Uganda's education sector plans revealed that current strategies to reduce poverty revolve around a strong assimilation-based development agenda, thereby focusing on three main areas of intervention: (a) increased access to education and retention; (b) improved quality of education; and (c) employment generation through education. The article finds that these assimilative approaches do not have an impact on the political, economic and social structures that cause poverty in the first place. Hence, it concludes that assimilative models in education are highly dependent on transformative approaches. Concretely, change cannot emerge only at the very grassroots level, i.e. through educating society at large, but also has to arise from the systemic level, i.e. government institutions at the local, national and global levels. Methodologically, the analysis draws on qualitative data that was collected in the course of two extensive field research stays in 2015 and 2017. In addition, quantitative data in the form of statistical abstracts inform the analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This is then illustrated and calibrated by drawing upon existing literatures and using evidence from legal cartels to approximate what would be observed absent policy. Measuring impact by the proportion of all potential harm that is deterred, our best estimate is two-thirds and, even on conservative assumptions, at least half of all harms (or seven times the detected harm) is deterred.","[Davies, Stephen; Mariuzzo, Franco] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Davies, Stephen; Mariuzzo, Franco; Ormosi, Peter L.] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Ormosi, Peter L.] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Davies, S (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Davies, S (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.w.davies@uea.ac.uk; f.mariuzzo@uea.ac.uk; p.ormosi@uea.ac.uk,"Davies, Stephen/HPD-3182-2023",", Franco/0000-0003-4604-1054; Ormosi, Peter/0000-0001-6472-6511",Economic and Social Research Council; Centre for Competition Policy,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Competition Policy,"Earlier drafts of this paper appeared previously as CCP WP 13-7.

Although biomarkers offer a large potential for social science and economic research, they impose a number of statistical challenges, often being distributed asymmetrically with heavy tails. Using data from the UK Household Panel Survey, we illustrate the comparative performance of a set of flexible parametric distributions, which allow for a wide range of skewness and kurtosis: the four-parameter generalized beta of the second kind (GB2), the three-parameter generalized gamma, and their three-, two-, or one-parameter nested and limiting cases. Commonly used blood-based biomarkers for inflammation, diabetes, cholesterol, and stress-related hormones are modelled. Although some of the three-parameter distributions nested within the GB2 outperform the latter for most of the biomarkers considered, the GB2 can be used as a guide for choosing among competing parametric distributions for biomarkers. Going beyond the mean to estimate tail probabilities, we find that GB2 performs fairly well with some disparities at the very high levels of glycated hemoglobin and fibrinogen. Commonly used linear models are shown to perform worse than almost all the flexible distributions.","[Davillas, Apostolos] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Jones, Andrew M.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Andrew M.] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Essex; University of York - UK; Monash University,"Davillas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",adavil@essex.ac.uk,"Jones, Andrew/C-3402-2008","Jones, Andrew/0000-0003-4114-1785; Davillas, Apostolos/0000-0002-6607-274X","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M008592/1]; Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship [MRF-2016-004]; ESRC [ES/M008592/1, ES/N00812X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/M008592/1; Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: MRF-2016-004",,8,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27,10,,,,,1617,1624,,10.1002/hec.3787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3787,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29900615,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000443806600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

These migrant workers have been praised by managers in the UK, who have frequently stated that they perceive these workers to have a strong work ethic' when measured on aspects such as absence from work rates. This article examines this perceived migrant work ethic' by analysing worker absence data from the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the period 2005-2012. Regression analysis reveals that when A8 migrant workers first arrive in the UK, they record substantially lower absence than native workers, but that these migrant absence levels assimilate within two to four years. If employers use this information to make hiring decisions, this may have negative implications for native workers, but, importantly, only in the short run.","[Dawson, Chris] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Business Econ, Bath, Avon, England; [Veliziotis, Michail] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Lecturer Human Resource Management, Southampton, Hants, England; [Hopkins, Benjamin] Univ Leicester, Work & Employment, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Bath; University of Southampton; Solent University; University of Leicester,"Dawson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",C.G.Dawson@bath.ac.uk,,"Veliziotis, Michail/0000-0002-2245-587X; Dawson, Chris/0000-0003-2514-5372",,,,,42,17,18,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Employing unique data on the geographical location of all bank branches in the UK, we connect firms' access to bank credit to the financial condition (i.e., bank health and the use of core deposits) of all bank branches in the vicinity of the firm for the period 2004-2011. Before the crisis, banks' local financial conditions did not influence credit availability irrespective of the functional distance (i.e., the distance between bank branch and bank headquarters). However, during the crisis, we find that SMEs with banks within their vicinity that have stronger financial conditions faced greater credit availability when the functional distance is close. Our results point to a flight to headquarters effect during the financial crisis.

During recessions, fears of unemployment stir up precautionary sentiments that induce agents to save more. The additional savings may be used as investments in both a productive asset (equity) and an unproductive nominal liquid asset. The desire to hold the nominal liquid asset puts deflationary pressure on the economy which, provided that nominal wages are sticky, increases labor costs, and reduces firm profits. Lower profits repress the desire to save in equity, which increases (the fear of) unemployment, and so on. This mechanism causes the model to behave differently from its complete markets version and is quantitatively important even if monetary policy counteracts the desire to hold more of the liquid asset by lowering the interest rate. The deflationary pressure yields a mean-reverting reduction in the price level, which implies an increase in expected inflation and a decrease in the expected real interest rate even if the policy rate does not adjust. Thus, our mechanism is different from the typical zero lower bound argument. Due to the deflationary spiral, our model also behaves differently from its incomplete market version without aggregate uncertainty, especially in terms of the impact of unemployment insurance on average employment levels.

We exploit the 1990s trade liberalization in Brazil as a natural experiment generating exogenous shocks to local economies. We document that regions exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a temporary increase in crime following liberalization. Next, we investigate through what channels the trade-induced economic shocks may have affected crime. We show that the shocks had significant effects on potential determinants of crime, such as labor market conditions, public goods provision, and income inequality. We propose a novel framework exploiting the distinct dynamic responses of these variables to obtain bounds on the effect of labor market conditions on crime. Our results indicate that this channel accounts for 75 to 93 percent of the effect of the trade-induced shocks on crime.","[Dix-Carneiro, Rafael] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 210A Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Soares, Rodrigo R.] Columbia Univ, 420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Soares, Rodrigo R.] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ulyssea, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Ulyssea, Gabriel] Univ Oxford, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",Duke University; Columbia University; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; University of Oxford,"Dix-Carneiro, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 210A Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",rafael.dix.carneiro@duke.edu; rsoares@columbia.edu; gabriel.ulyssea@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Soares, Rodrigo/I-4367-2013","Soares, Rodrigo/0000-0003-1158-3865; Ulyssea, Gabriel/0000-0001-7270-2640",W.E.

Specific objectives were to 1) describe the methodologies used and 2) identify the strengths and limitations of the studies. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase databases for studies that compared predictions of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination of two or more mathematical models. We categorized studies into two groups on the basis of their data source for comparison (previously published results or new simulation results) and performed a qualitative synthesis of study conclusions. Results: We identified 115 eligible articles (only 5% generated new simulations from the reviewed models) examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination against 14 pathogens (69% of studies examined human papillomavirus, influenza, and/or pneumococcal vaccines). The goal of most of studies was to summarize evidence for vaccination policy decisions, and cost-effectiveness was the most frequent outcome examined. Only 33%, 25%, and 3% of studies followed a systematic approach to identify eligible studies, assessed the quality of studies, and performed a quantitative synthesis of results, respectively. A greater proportion of model comparisons using published studies followed a systematic approach to identify eligible studies and to assess their quality, whereas more studies using new simulations performed quantitative synthesis of results and identified drivers of model conclusions.

We find robust evidence that pupils in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in coed schools, which could be due to single-sex peers in school and classroom, or unobservable school-level covariates. Focusing on switching schools, we find that the conversion of the pupil gender type from single-sex to coed leads to worse academic outcomes for both boys and girls, conditional on school fixed effects and time-varying observables. While for boys, the negative effect is largely driven by exposure to mixed-gender peers at school-level, it is class-level exposure to mixed-gender peers that explains this disadvantage for girls.","[Dustmann, Christian] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ku, Hyejin] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kwak, Do Won] Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Korea University,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; h.ku@ucl.ac.uk; dwkwak@korea.ac.kr,,"Ku, Hyejin/0000-0001-7291-4969",,,,,62,13,13,2,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54,,,,,,79,99,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.005,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000447577200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Endogenous markups can magnify the impact of shocks on consumption and labor supply through intertemporal substitution mechanisms, and the optimal fiscal policy requires a variable labor income subsidy and a capital income tax that converges to zero in the long run. With an endogenous number of goods and strategic interactions, entry also affects markups and the optimal fiscal policy requires also a tax on profits. I characterize equilibrium and efficient market structures and derive optimal tax rules for a variety of preferences, including a new type of general additive preferences that nest direct, indirect, implicit, and homothetic additivity.","[Etro, Federico] Univ Florence, 8 Finsbury Circle,EC2M7-EA, London, England; [Etro, Federico] Charles River Associates Inc, 8 Finsbury Circle,EC2M7-EA, London, England",Charles River Associates,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, 8 Finsbury Circle,EC2M7-EA, London, England.;Etro, F (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, 8 Finsbury Circle,EC2M7-EA, London, England.",fetro@crai.com,,,,,,,59,11,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This paper illustrates why ideas matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change. Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political economists to go beyond 'incentives'. Future efforts to tackle inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling 'norm perceptions' (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance; and strengthening social movements.

In this model, asset prices are volatile, and price-earnings ratios are persistent, even though there is no fundamental uncertainty and financial markets are sequentially complete. I show that the model can explain a substantial risk premium while generating smooth time series for consumption. In my model, asset price fluctuations are Pareto inefficient and there is a role for treasury or central bank intervention to stabilize asset price volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recent empirical research suggests that heterogeneity in firm characteristics is crucial to understand wage dispersion. Lower trade costs as well as labor and product market reforms are considered critical drivers of inequality dynamics. We ask how these factors affect wage dispersion and how much of their effect on inequality is attributable to changes in wage dispersion between and within firms. To tackle these questions, we incorporate directed job search into a dynamic model of international trade where wage inequality results from the interplay of convex adjustment costs with firms' different hiring needs along their life cycles. Fitting the model to German linked employer-employee data for the years 1996-2009, we find that firm heterogeneity explains about half of the surge in inequality. The most important mechanism is tougher product market competition driven by domestic product market deregulation and, indirectly, by international trade.

Our results are robust after controlling for transaction costs, reversals, and alternative limits to arbitrage. The global political environment affects the profitability of the momentum strategy in the foreign exchange market; investors following such strategies are compensated for the exposure to the global political risk of those currencies they hold, that is, the past winners, and exploit the lower returns of loser portfolios. The risk compensation is mainly justified by the different exposures of foreign currencies in the momentum portfolio to U.S. political shocks, which is the main component of global political risk.","[Filippou, Ilias; Gozluklu, Arie E.] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Taylor, Mark P.] Washington Univ, Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Warwick; Washington University (WUSTL),"Taylor, MP (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",ilias.filippou@wbs.ac.uk; arie.gozluklu@wbs.ac.uk; mark.p.taylor@wustl.edu,,"Taylor, Mark/0000-0002-4158-0983",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Warwick Business School,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Warwick Business School,"Filippou, ilias.filippou@wbs.ac.uk, Gozluklu, arie.gozluklu@wbs.ac.uk, University of Warwick Business School; Taylor (corresponding author), mark.p.taylor@wustl.edu, Washington University in St. Louis Olin School of Business.

In our setup, the actual probability of the good outcome (a win) can be determined based on computer simulations from any point in the process. We compare this actual probability to the subjective probability stated by participants at three different points in each of six races. In line with previous research in which participants have direct access to actual probabilities, we find that the inverse S-shaped curve relating subjective to actual probabilities is also evident in our far more complex situation, and that there is only a limited degree of learning through repeated play. We show that the model in the inverse S-shaped function family that provides the best fit to our data is Prelec's 1998 conditional invariant model. We also find that individuals who report a greater degree of ambiguity are more pessimistic and less responsive to actual changes in real probabilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we introduce a new methodology for simulating crop-water production functions using process-based crop growth models, which captures explicitly the interacting effects of farmers' intraseasonal irrigation decision-making, stochastic weather conditions, and physical and socio-economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water. Through a case study application for groundwater irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains, we demonstrate that constraints to irrigation scheduling caused by aquifer depletion, combined with farmers' limited foresight of future weather conditions, have significant impacts on estimated seasonal crop-water production functions. Our results highlight that the failure to account for these factors fully in previous simulation approaches will lead to errors in estimates of the impacts of groundwater depletion on farmers' future resilience to drought and climate change. Our proposed simulation methodology is generalizable to different production systems or crop growth models, and provides a tool for assessing how economic benefits derived from irrigation vary spatially and temporally due to heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and irrigation practices.","[Foster, T.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Brozovic, N.] Univ Nebraska, Robert B Daugherty Water Food Global Inst, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Manchester; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Foster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",timothy.foster@manchester.ac.uk,"Foster, Timothy/JRY-8775-2023","Foster, Timothy/0000-0001-9594-1556",,,,,94,42,47,5,61,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The aim of this case study was to highlight in a real-world context how a qualitative approach has been applied to gain insight into current practice (delineating existing care pathways) for typhoid fever in Ghana, which can then assist in model structure conceptualisation in a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. The perspectives of a range of healthcare professionals working in different settings and across different practices in the Eastern region of Ghana were captured with a self-administered survey using open-ended questions and analysed using the framework method. A total of 51 completed questionnaires were retrieved representing a 73% response rate. It was found that two main care pathways for typhoid fever exist in Ghana and there was no consensus on how a new test might be applied to the existing pathways. The two settings in Ghana have different care pathways and any cost-effectiveness analysis should consider the alternative pathways separately. This study demonstrated that framework analysis is a qualitative methodology that is likely to be accessible and feasible across a wide range of health economic settings.","[Frempong, Samuel N.; Davenport, Clare; Barton, Pelham] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Sutton, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Fac Med & Hlth, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Sutton, Andrew J.] NHIR Diagnost Evidence Cooperat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Nonvignon, Justice] Univ Ghana, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management, Accra, Ghana",University of Birmingham; University of Leeds; University of Ghana,"Sutton, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Fac Med & Hlth, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Sutton, AJ (通讯作者)，NHIR Diagnost Evidence Cooperat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.j.sutton@leeds.ac.uk,"Frempong, Samuel/JQT-2086-2023; Davenport, Clare/AFR-7474-2022","Frempong, Samuel/0000-0002-3042-7393; Davenport, Clare/0000-0001-5659-4889",,,,,30,3,6,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This link is interesting because field evidence suggests that people's behavior in domains like charitable giving, tax evasion, corporate culture and corruption is influenced by leaders (CEOs, politicians) and beliefs about others' behavior. Our framework is a repeated experimental public goods game with and without a leader who makes a contribution to the public good before others (the followers). We find that leaders strongly shape their followers' initial beliefs and contributions. In later rounds, followers put more weight on other followers' past behavior than on the leader's current action. This creates a path dependency the leader can hardly correct. We discuss the implications for understanding belief effects in naturally occurring situations. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Our identified stress regimes are associated with corporate credit tightening and with NBER recessions. An exogenous deterioration in our financial conditions index has strong negative effects in economic activity, and negative amplification effects on inflation in the stress regime.

We show how considering Body(1)- Language- Emotions- History- Eros- Silence can configure a nurturing technology call CLEHES. This tool has been applied for diverse people, groups, communities, and organizations that need and wish to develop their own skills to inquire conflict practice resolutions, in order to learn as a human decision support system. Conflict situations are understood as interactions, a breakdown in-between CLEHES from the individual or social standpoints. This tool allows observing the boundaries of conflict situations and building an observer system with the ability to manage, solve, or attenuate the situation, enabling fresh decision making attending to the context in which the organization moves. This learning process happens in a constructed place called an Enactive Laboratory where strategies are developed to cope with the domains and context in the perceived individual and human activities systems.

Evidence from a social trading platform,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social trading; Disposition effect; Scopic regime; Retail trading; Foreign exchange; Behavioral bias,PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR,"A scopic regime constitutes a state of permanent reciprocal observation and scrutiny among participants. We investigate whether this environment reduces the disposition effect among retail traders as they are constantly scrutinized by others, thus driving them to realize and limit their losses. We use two anonymous data sets, the first from a popular social trading platform (STP) governed by a scopic regime, and the second from a traditional foreign exchange broker. STPs allow participants to interact and copy each other's trades using mirror trading, thus implicitly creating two groups; trade leaders who execute unique trades to build their performance record, and copiers who allocate funds to be managed by the former. We find ample evidence of a weaker disposition effect among trade leaders in the scopic environment compared to traders in a traditional setting. Our findings suggest that a state of constant observation and scrutiny erodes the disposition effect as individuals become more self-conscious of their actions and limit their losses to avoid tarnishing their public trading record.

We develop a framework where leveraging extracts more rents from the monopoly market by restoring' second-degree price discrimination. In a random coefficient model with complements, we derive a policy test for when incentives to reduce rival quality will hold.

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with key regional stakeholders, the article reveals how peripheral post-industrial places are constrained by their histories. This is found to be manifest in different ways, such as low aspirations, generational unemployment and a loss of identity which are in turn compounded by negative perceptions of place and opportunity. These issues culminate in institutional hysteresis at the local level and constrain entrepreneurial ambition. The article argues that the rigidity and reproduction of informal institutions continues to stymie economic resilience and growth. We conclude by reflecting on the implications for entrepreneurship in peripheral post-industrial places as well as with recommendations for policy.","[Gherhes, Cristian; Vorley, Tim] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Ctr Reg Econ & Enterprise Dev, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Williams, Nick] Univ Leeds, Ctr Enterprise & Entrepreneurship Studies, Sch Business, 17 Springfield Mt, Leeds LS2 9NG, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Leeds,"Williams, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Ctr Enterprise & Entrepreneurship Studies, Sch Business, 17 Springfield Mt, Leeds LS2 9NG, W Yorkshire, England.",n.e.williams@leeds.ac.uk,"Gherhes, Cristian/AAB-4245-2021; Williams, Nicholas/H-3408-2015","Gherhes, Cristian/0000-0003-2085-3580; Williams, Nicholas/0000-0001-6291-9483",,,,,76,31,31,4,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

AN EVALUATION USING BOUNDARY DISCONTINUITIES,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLASS SIZE; STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; RESOURCES; QUALITY; DESIGN; MATTER,"This study exploits spatial anomalies in school funding policy in England to provide new evidence on the impact of resources on student achievement in urban areas. Anomalies arise because the funding allocated to Local Education Authorities (LEA) depends, through a funding formula, on the 'additional educational needs' of its population and prices in the district. However, the money each school receives from its LEA is not necessarily related to the school's own specific local conditions and constraints. This implies that neighbouring schools with similar intakes, operating in the same labour market, facing similar prices, but in different LEAs, can receive very different incomes. We find that these funding disparities give rise to sizeable differences in pupil attainment in national tests at the end of primary school, showing that school resources have an important role to play in improving educational attainment, especially for lower socio-economic groups. The design is geographical boundary discontinuity design which compares neighbouring schools, matched on a proxy for additional educational needs of its students (free school meal entitlement - FSM), in adjacent districts. The key identification requirement is one of conditional ignorability of the level of LEA grant, where conditioning is on geographical location of schools and their proportion of FSM children.

Prior studies established this relation using the assumption that the long-run relation is intertemporally constant. However, there is much recent evidence demonstrating that this assumption may not hold in practice. To address this issue and go beyond the restrictive time invariant environment, we employ the use of the time-varying cointegration framework of Bierens and Martins (2010). We present evidence of the long-run oil-economy relation evolving over the 1974-2015 period, with major events such as the Gulf War and the financialisation of commodity markets proving to be driving forces across the U.S., European and G7 economies considered.

In particular, in the condition of ambiguity as well as risk, individuals tend to exhibit ambiguity aversion. The core principle of rational (consequential) behaviour conceived by Savage (1954), that is the 'Savage Sure Thing' principle, has been shown to be violated. In mathematical language, this violation is equivalent to the violation of the Law of total probability, (Kolmogorov, 1933). Given the importance of original findings in the call for a generalization of classical expected utility, we perform in this paper a set of experiments related to expressing investment preferences: (i) under objective risk, (ii) after a preceding gain, or loss. In accordance with previous findings we detected state dependence in human judgement (previous gain or loss changed the preference state of the participants) as well as violation of consequential reasoning under risk. We propose a quantum probabilistic model of agents' preferences, where non-consequentialism and state dependence can be well explained via interference of complex probability amplitudes. A geometric depiction of the experimental findings with a state reconstruction procedure from statistical data via the inverse Born's rule (1926), allows for an accurate representation of agents' preference formation in risky investment choice.

Although existing models partially predict such variations, so far, they have been unable to predict oil prices accurately in this highly volatile market. The development of an effective, predictive model has therefore become a prime objective of research in this field. Our approach, albeit based in part on previous research, develops an original methodology, in that we have created a risk forecasting model with the ability to predict oil price fluctuations caused by changes in both fundamental and transient risk factors. We achieve this by disintegrating the multi-scale risk-structure of the crude oil market using Variational Mode Decomposition. Normal and transient risk factors are then extracted from the crude oil price using Variational Mode Decomposition and modelled separately using the Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model. Both risk factors are integrated and ensembled to produce the risk estimates. We then apply our proposed risk forecasting model to predicting future downside risk level in three major crude oil markets, namely the West Taxes Intermediate (WTI), the Brent Market, and the OPEC market. The results demonstrate that our model has the ability to capture downside risk estimates with significantly improved precision, thus reducing estimation errors and increasing forecasting reliability.

Some policy must be chosen for the fair and efficient rationing of power, however, transmission constraints and unreliabile generation can make it difficult to achieve a particular allocation of power. We develop methods to quantify the trade-off between maximising the total amount of power delivered and distributing the available power in a fairer way. To do so, we model a common situation in which the system operator minimises load shedding, subject to exogenous proportional allocation targets for different regions. We then explore how the level of permitted deviation from the target affects the level of load shedding. This minimisation problem is mathematically challenging, but we develop an efficient solution method for it based on Lagrangian decomposition. We apply our methods to a case study of the Nigerian Power system and analyse the Pareto frontiers between efficiency and fairness obtained under different specifications of the problem. In our case study, we show that current Nigerian policies reduce the total amount of power delivered by up to 5%, but that enforcing policies over a longer time horizon substantially reduces this efficiency penalty.","[Heggie, Alastair] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Energy Syst, Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Eager, Dan] EMRC, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [McKinnon, Ken] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Math, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Van Der Weijde, Adriaan H.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Van Der Weijde, Adriaan H.] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh,"Heggie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Energy Syst, Kings Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Midlothian, Scotland.",a.heggie@ed.ac.uk; dan.eager@energy-mrc.com; K.McKinnon@ed.ac.uk; H.Vanderweijde@ed.ac.uk,"van der Weijde, Adriaan Hendrik/AAN-3878-2021","van der Weijde, Adriaan Hendrik/0000-0002-6822-5527",University of Edinburgh; EMRC,University of Edinburgh; EMRC,The authors would like to thank EMRC (http://energy-mrc.co.uk/) for their help in the preparation of this paper.

However, network externalities are no isolated phenomena. They are based on competing standards in a comprehensive network of technology lines that are based on one another and remain to various degrees interoperable or compatible. As some evidence from the ICT sector inparticular shows, compatibility and tying or bundling of standards may be employed as strategic tools. The present paper investigates the economic role of tied standards for the dynamics of competition between standards. A replicator model operating on an aggregated level is complemented by an agent-based simulation with explicit representation of the network structure among users. A variety of effects are studied, including the role of initial usage share, manipulation of compatibility, expansion of vendors into other segments, as well as the network structure and central or peripheral positioning of agents. The agent-based model contrasts a complete network and a regular ring network with asymmetric network structures derived from Barabasi and Albert's preferential attachment mechanism and triadic closure.","[Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Math Inst, INET, Walton Well Rd,Eagle House, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hochschulring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Bremen,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Math Inst, INET, Walton Well Rd,Eagle House, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hochschulring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",torsten.heinrich@uni-bremen.de,,"Heinrich, Torsten/0000-0001-8873-0806",,,,,40,4,5,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Each asset price can hit 0; we only exclude that this ever happens simultaneously for all assets. We start from two simple, economically motivated axioms, namely, absence of arbitrage (in the sense of NUPBR) and absence of relative arbitrage among all buy-and-hold strategies (called static efficiency). A valuation process for a payoff is then called semi-efficient consistent if the financial market enlarged by that process still satisfies this combination of properties. It turns out that this approach lies in the middle between the extremes of valuing by risk-neutral expectation and valuing by absence of arbitrage alone. We show that this always yields put-call parity, although put and call values themselves can be nonunique, even for complete markets. We provide general formulas for put and call values in complete markets and show that these are symmetric and that both contain three terms in general. We also show that our approach recovers all the put-call parity respecting valuation formulas in the classic theory as special cases, and we explain when and how the different terms in the put and call valuation formulas disappear or simplify. Along the way, we also define and characterize completeness for general semimartingale financial markets and connect this to the classic theory.","[Herdegen, Martin] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Ramphal Bldg R2-37, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Schweizer, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Math, HG G51-2,Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweizer, Martin] Swiss Finance Inst, Walchestr 9, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Warwick; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Schweizer, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Math, HG G51-2,Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.schweizer@math.ethz.ch,,,"Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [SNF 105218_150101]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [105218_150101] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Swiss Finance Institute (SFI) and the National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management).

Major differences exist across countries in how successful these efforts are, and the United States is often used as the key example of a country with a strong resistance to shifting away from private car use. Even within the United States however, there is strong heterogeneity across regions and across different types of travellers. This paper seeks to add empirical evidence to understand the drivers of mode choice for intercity travel, using stated choice data from two major US intercity corridors: the Northeast Corridor (NEC) and the Cascade Corridor. We develop a hybrid choice model that allows for deterministic and random variations across travellers in their preferences, some of which can be linked to underlying attitudinal constructs. Our results highlight extensive heterogeneity and provide interesting insights into the drivers of behaviour, and the relationship between attitudes and actual choices. As an example, we see that for some groups, notably West Coast respondents, a stronger anti-car attitude is counter-acted by a reduced utility for non-car modes when making choices, possibly due quality of public transport provision. Similarly, for other groups, such as older and female travellers, a reduced concern for privacy, which would benefit public transport, is counter-acted by a stronger pro-car attitude. These findings highlight the complex way in which attitudes can influence choices and provide insights for targeted policy interventions. Through scenario testing, we also show how future modal split might change depending on how these patterns of heterogeneity evolve over time, noting that the way this might happen is of course unknown at present.","[Hess, Stephane; Spitz, Greg; Bradley, Mark] RSG, 55 Railrd Row, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Coogan, Matt] New England Transportat Inst, Ten Clay Rd, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@leeds.ac.uk; gspitz@rsginc.com; mark.bradley@rsginc.com; cooganmatt@aol.com,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518",TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),The original study on which this work is based was funded by TRB's NCRRP program.

We correct for the endogeneity of R&D using tax-induced changes to R&D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower profitability, these effects are significantly smaller for firms with a larger stock of R&D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&D allowing firms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while firms in import-competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&D-intensive firms downsize considerably less.","[Hombert, Johan] HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France; [Hombert, Johan] CEPR, London, England; [Matray, Adrien] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Hombert, J (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France.;Hombert, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",,,,Investissements d'Avenir Labex [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance,Investissements d'Avenir Labex(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance,"We thank Nick Bloom; Gerard Hoberg; Rich Mathews; Stephen Redding; Amit Seru; Stefan Zeume; Michael Roberts; and two anonymous referees as well as seminar participants at INSEAD, Copenhagen Business School, Stanford University, CSEF-University of Naples, Imperial College, Montreal University, Erasmus University, Ghent University, the Harvard Business School; and conference participants at the Labex Ecodec Workshop at HEC Paris, the London Business School 2015 Summer Finance Symposium, the 2015 Western Finance Association meeting, the 2015 Workshop on Entrepreneurial Finance and Innovation Around the World, the 2015 Workshop on the Economics of Corporate Ownership, the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (Gerzensee) 2015, the 2015 Econometric Society World Meeting, and the 2016 NBER Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.

Moreover, we develop a flow-dependent version of the model to characterize the impact of pick-up and drop-off congestion. In another extended model we take into account the riders' individual evaluation on different transportation modes. Due to the large size of the resulting models, we develop a large neighbourhood search algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency.","[Hou, Liwen; Zhang, Dali] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Li, Dong] York Univ, Sch Management, York, N Yorkshire, England",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of York - UK,"Zhang, DL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",zhangdl@sjtu.edu.cn,"Hou, Liwen/L-7459-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501127, 71372108]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and the Editor-in-Chief for their helpful comments and suggestions.

One of the themes in this field of research is related to partnership approaches, as one way of stimulating functioning collaboration between formally independent private and public organisations. The aim of this paper is to explore the role and function of partnerships as a way of supporting well-functioning public transport networks and services in fragmented institutional settings. The empirical focus is on partnerships between operators and public (transport) authorities in two different legal settings: England and Sweden. The analysis is based on interviews with operators and public transport authorities in two metropolitan regions in each country where innovative partnership working has been developed to deal with various types of barriers to delivering better public transport. The results show the key qualities of these partnerships that are required for them to function. Although the regulatory contexts are very different, the partnership qualities are very similar in both cases.","[Hrelja, Robert] VTI, Linkoping, Sweden; [Hrelja, Robert] K2, Lund, Sweden; [Rye, Tom] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mullen, Caroline] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",VTI; Edinburgh Napier University; University of Leeds,"Hrelja, R (通讯作者)，Olaus Magnus Vag 35, SE-58195 Linkoping, Sweden.",robert.hrelja@vti.se,"Hrelja, Robert/HGD-9302-2022; Hrelja, Robert D/E-6744-2011","Hrelja, Robert/0000-0002-9445-784X; Mullen, Caroline/0000-0003-2915-5009",Swedish Innovation Agency (VINNOVA),Swedish Innovation Agency (VINNOVA)(Vinnova),This research was done in collaboration with K2-The Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport.

We find evidence consistent with information revelation theories. We also find strong support for the existence of a quid pro quo whereby broking revenues are a significant determinant of investors' IPO allocations and profits.

Our new, dynamic measure of fund-level herding captures the tendency of fund managers to follow the trades of the institutional crowd. We find that herding funds underperform their antiherding peers by over 2% per year. Differences in skill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment decisions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades of the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent, wider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career concerns.","[Jiang, Hao] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Verardo, Michela] London Sch Econ, London, England",Michigan State University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Jiang, H (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,Paul Woolley Centre at the London School of Economics,Paul Woolley Centre at the London School of Economics,"We are grateful for comments from Amil Dasgupta; Dong Lou; Christopher Polk; Lukasz Pomorski; Rene Stulz; Sheridan Titman; Dimitri Vayanos; Paul Woolley; and Kathy Yuan as well as from conference participants at the 2011 IDC Summer Conference, 2012 WFA, and 2015 CFA UK Society; and seminar participants at the Universities of Aarhus, Amsterdam, Arizona, BI Oslo, Cattolica Milan, Cologne, Drexel, Erasmus Rotterdam, ESSEC, IESE Barcelona, Kent, London School of Economics, Lugano, Mannheim, Michigan State, Nottingham, Reading, and Vienna.

This paper develops a spatially explicit methodology to value the benefits from improvements in biodiversity resulting from current policy initiatives to reduce nitrogen emissions. Using the UK as a case study, we quantify nitrogen impacts on plant diversity in four habitats: heathland, acid grassland, dunes and bogs, at fine spatial resolution. Focusing on non-use values for biodiversity we apply value-transfer based on household's willingness to pay to avoid changes in plant species richness, and calculate the benefit of projected emission declines of 37% for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 6% for ammonia (NH3) over the scenario period 2007-2020. The annualised benefit resulting from these pollutant declines is 32.7 pound m (4.4 pound m to 109.7 pound m, 95% Confidence Interval), with the greatest benefit accruing from heathland and acid grassland due to their large area. We also calculate damage costs per unit of NO2 and NH3 emitted, to quantify some of the environmental impacts of air pollution for use alongside damage costs for human health in policy appraisal. The benefit is 103 pound (33 pound to 237) pound per tonne of NO2 saved, and 414 pound (139 pound to 1022) pound per tonne of NH3 saved.","[Jones, Laurence; Hall, Jane; Mills, Gina] Environm Ctr Wales, CEH, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Milne, Alice] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Provins, Allan] Econ Environm Consultancy Eftec, 4 City Rd, London EC1Y 2AA, England; [Christie, Michael] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystywth Business Sch, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; Aberystwyth University,"Jones, L (通讯作者)，Environm Ctr Wales, CEH, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",lj@ceh.ac.uk,"Christie, Michael/AAN-6021-2020; Milne, Alice/HGE-7308-2022; Mills, Gina E/E-4540-2010; Jones, Laurence/A-3900-2011","Christie, Michael/0000-0002-8346-9140; Mills, Gina E/0000-0001-9870-2868; Jones, Laurence/0000-0002-4379-9006; Milne, Alice/0000-0002-4509-0578","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) [AQ0827]; NERC [ceh020015] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) under contract AQ0827.",,54,8,9,5,61,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Third party punishment was frequently observed, in line with previous studies. Despite the prevalence of punishment, having one third party punisher in a group did not make one's defection materially unbeneficial because of the weak punishment intensity observed. When a third party player's action choice was made known to another third party player in a different group, however, third party punishment was sufficiently strong to transform the dilemma's incentive structure into a coordination game, through which cooperation norms can be effectively enforced.

If the decisions whether to pursue the action are made simultaneously, then neither or both may acquiesce leading to an inefficient outcome. However, inefficiency may be reduced if players move sequentially. We test this experimentally by introducing repeated two-stage versions of such a game where the action is individually profitable. In one version, players may wait in the first stage to see what their partner did and then coordinate in the second stage. In another version, sequential decision-making is imposed by assigning one player to move in stage one and the other in stage two. Although there are fewer cooperative decisions in the two-stage treatments, we show that overall subjects coordinate better on efficient cooperation and on avoiding both acquiescing. Yet, only some pairs actually achieve higher profits, while the least cooperative pairs do worse in the two-stage games than their single-stage counterparts. For these, rather than facilitating coordination, the additional stage invites unsuccessful attempts to disguise uncooperative play, which are met with punishment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, climbing stairs is physically more challenging than level walking and results in a high number of falls, hence substantial medical costs. Understanding the impact of a dynamic environment, such as that of a bus, on people's gait whilst walking on stairs, would enable the reduction, or even the elimination of balance-loss falls. The gait of 29 healthy and regular bus users (20-80 y.o.) was monitored whilst ascending and descending a static and moving staircase. The tasks took place in a real double-decker bus which was initially stationary. When the bus was moving, ascending was tested during medium acceleration (+ 1.5 m/s(2)), while descending during medium deceleration (1.5 m/s(2)), reproducing the most common movements aboard buses. Examining healthy people enables the identification of differences in gait that are accounted for the alteration in the bus environment and gives the opportunity to further consider the challenges mobility impaired passengers are experiencing. After applying the method established in level walking, chi-square tests were performed on participants' step type (resulting from the ground reaction force profile), taking into account participants' age and gender and the bus acceleration. The outcomes revealed that age and gender affect people's gait in a dynamic environment. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the increase of acceleration and the type of steps passengers use to sustain their balance, as the number of three-peak steps was increasing with the increase of bus acceleration. Hence, the bus environment forces people to use a walking style other than their natural one and older people in particular, unconsciously increase the contact area between their foot and the floor (three-peak steps) to increase balance. Surprisingly, males appear less able than females to control balance. People's stair walking in a moving vehicle was investigated for the first time and has opened-up new horizons for gait analysis in dynamic environments.","[Karekla, Xenia; Tyler, Nick] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Karekla, X (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",x.karekla@ucl.ac.uk,,"Karekla, Xenia/0000-0001-7889-361X; Tyler, Nick/0000-0001-7079-1301",,,,,25,8,9,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The concept of multiple remote tower operation is that air traffic controllers (ATCOs) can control several airfields from a distant virtual control centre. The control of multiple airfields can be centralised to a virtual centre permitting the more efficient use of ATCO resources. This research was sponsored by the Single European Sky ATM Research Program and the ATM Operations Division of the Irish Aviation Authority. A safety case was developed for migration of multiple remote tower services to live operations. This research conducted 50 large scale demonstration trials of remote tower operations from single tower operations to multiple tower operations for safety assessment by air navigation safety regulators in 2016. A dedicated team of air traffic controllers and technology experts successfully completed the safety assessment of multiple remote tower operations in real time. The implementation of this innovative technology requires a careful balance between cost efficiency and the safety of the air traffic control in terms of capacity and human performance. The live trial exercises demonstrated that the air traffic services provided by the remote tower for a single airport and two medium airports by a single ATCO with 'in sequence' and 'simultaneous' aircraft operation was at least as safe as provided by the local towers at Cork and Shannon aerodromes. No safety occurrence was reported nor did any operational safety issue arise during the conduct of the fifty live trial exercises.,"[Kearney, Peter] Irish Aviat Author, ATM Operat & Strategy, 11-12 Dolier St, Dublin, Ireland; [Li, Wen-Chin] Cranfield Univ, Safety & Accid Invest Ctr, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Li, WC (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Safety & Accid Invest Ctr, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",wenchin.li@cranfield.ac.uk,"Li, Wen-Chin/GWM-7898-2022","Kearney, Peter/0000-0003-3236-9913; Li, Wen-Chin/0000-0002-8825-3701",Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR) [LSD 02.04]; Irish Aviation Authority [P7883/ETE/WCL]; European Commission,Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR); Irish Aviation Authority; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was supported by Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR, LSD 02.04), and the Irish Aviation Authority (P7883/ETE/WCL).

This study aimed to identify and analyze evidence supporting the use of the emerging magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared to alternative stimulatory and ablative interventions for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor: radiofrequency thalamotomy, unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS), and stereotactic radiosurgery. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and economic evidence for each intervention. Because of the lack of comparative evidence captured, a feasibility assessment was performed to determine possible comparisons between interventions, and newly established matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison techniques were used to conduct a comparison between unilateral DBS aggregate data and MRgFUS individual patient data. Results: The systematic literature review identified 1,559 records, and screening yielded 46 relevant articles. The captured studies demonstrated that radiofrequency thalamotomy, DBS, stereotactic radiosurgery, and MRgFUS all exhibit clinical efficacy, with variation in onset and duration of tremor relief, and are each associated with a unique safety profile. The matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison results demonstrated no evidence of a difference in efficacy (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Total) and HRQoL (measured by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part C) outcomes between MRgFUS and unilateral DBS in the short term (<= 12 months). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that MRgFUS could elicit similar short-term tremor- and HRQoL-related benefits to DBS, the current standard of care, and allowed for the first robust statistical comparison between these interventions.","[Langford, Bryony E.; Ridley, Christian J.

R.",,,Urban poverty across the spectrum of Vietnam's towns and cities,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Urban poverty; Subjective welfare; Small area estimation; Vietnam,SUBJECTIVE WELFARE; CONSUMPTION; HAPPINESS; POOR,"Vietnam's urban population is growing rapidly: by 2020 45% of Vietnamese are forecasted to be residing in cities. Even though poverty today remains predominantly a rural phenomenon, there is a need to better understand the landscape of poverty in urban areas. Drawing on small-area estimation methods we estimate welfare outcomes at the level of individual towns and cities in Vietnam, including even the smallest towns. Such estimates could not be produced using national sample surveys alone. Results show an inverse relationship between poverty and city size in Vietnam, with the urban poor being disproportionately concentrated in small towns and cities. This relationship is robust to the location of the poverty line as well as to alternative city-size definitions. Interestingly, our evidence of a clear gradient between absolute poverty and city size is not replicated for subjective welfare, measured by self-reported food sufficiency. The absolute poverty-city size gradient does, however, accord with the observation of striking variation in service availability across cities of different size in Vietnam. Small town residents are typically confronted with far lower per-capita availability of basic services than are large city dwellers. The results suggest that policymakers concerned to tackle urban poverty in Vietnam should not neglect attending to smaller towns. Addressing inequalities in access to key basic services across the entire urban population may represent one means to this end. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The main macroeconomic indicators of financialization in the USA show structural breaks that can be dated around the period of the Great Recession. The reliance of households on the formal financial system appears to have weakened for the first time since the early 1980s. The financial sector has lacked the dynamism of the previous three decades, becoming more reliant on government. The state has increased its own indebtedness and supported large financial institutions via unconventional monetary policy measures. At the same time, state intervention has tightened the regulatory framework for big banks. The future path of financialization in the USA will depend heavily on government policy with regard to state debt and financial regulation, although the scope for boosting financialization is narrow.","[Lapavitsas, Costas] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Mendieta-Munoz, Ivan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Lapavitsas, C (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Off 269,Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",cl5@soas.ac.uk,"Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/AAC-5221-2020","Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/0000-0003-0018-5642",,,,,43,7,8,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Different than most typically discussed climate policies, degrowth not only aims at reducing the fossil fuel use in an economy, but rather (besides other social and political goals) at a reduction of all factor inputs, which may lead to different leakage implications. We conduct the first investigation of degrowth in a multi-country setting in order to (i) compare the leakage effects of national pure emission reduction policies to degrowth scenarios, (ii) identify underlying channels by decomposing the implied emission changes into scale, composition, and technique effects, and (iii) investigate which country characteristics determine degrowth's relative effectiveness to overcome the leakage problem. Using a structural gravity model, we find that degrowth indeed significantly reduces leakage by keeping the sectoral composition of the country more stable and reducing uncommitted countries' incentives to shift towards more energy-intensive production techniques. The higher effectiveness of degrowth in reducing carbon emissions is most pronounced for small and trade-open economies with comparatively clean production technologies.","[Larch, Mario] Univ Bayreuth, GEP Univ Nottingham, CEPII, CESifo, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Larch, Mario] Ifo Inst, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Loning, Markus] UCL, Dept Geog, Chorley Inst, Pearson Bldg,Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Wanner, Joschka] Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; University of Bayreuth; University of London; University College London; University of Bayreuth,"Wanner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",joschka.wanner@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Wanner, Joschka/0000-0001-9090-545X; , Markus/0000-0002-2967-5330",,,,,78,2,2,2,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We show that such mutations can result from rational behavior when the dictator's flow use of repression is complementary to his stock of wrongdoings: past wrongdoings then perpetuate further wrongdoings and the dictator can unintentionally get trapped in a repressive steady state where he himself suffers from ex-post regret. This then begs the question why such a dictator would ever choose to do wrong in the first place. We show that this can be explained from the dictator's uncertainty over his degree of impunity in relation to wrongdoing, which induces him to experiment along this dimension. This produces a setting where any individual rising to power can end up as either a moderate leader, or as a dreaded tyrant. Since derailment is accidental and accompanied by ex-post regret, increasing accountability can be in the interest of both the public and the dictator.","[Larcom, Shaun] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Willems, Tim] OxCarre, Oxford, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cape Town; University of Oxford,"Sarr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa.",stl25@cam.ac.uk; mare.sarr@uct.ac.za; timwillems85@gmail.com,,"Sarr, Mare/0000-0002-5903-7102; Willems, Tim/0000-0002-1100-5312",,,,,62,1,1,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

However, the implications of choosing a particular approach remain unclear. We compare the use of the three main diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based national unit costs in England to determine whether choice of approach can impact on economic evaluation results.MethodsA cost-utility model was developed to compare secondary fracture prevention models of care for hip fracture patients, using data from large primary and hospital care administrative datasets in England. A healthcare and personal social services payer perspective was adopted, and utilities were informed by a meta-regression. Hospital resource use was valued using three DRG-based unit costs, and regression-based costing models were developed using data from 13,906 patients to inform the model health states.ResultsFinished consultant episode (FCE)-level reference costs resulted in the highest costs on admission (9075) and in the year of the fracture (14,440) pound. Relative to FCE-level costs, spell-level tariffs led to the lowest total hospital care costs per patient within 1year of fracture (-3691) pound compared with spell-level reference costs (-2106) pound. At a 20,000 pound/quality-adjusted life-year threshold, using spell-level reference costs or spell-level tariffs, the introduction of a nurse-led fracture liaison service model of care was the cost-effective alternative. However, using FCE-level reference costs, usual care was the cost-effective option.Conclusions Our results show that, conditional on the set of national unit costs adopted, the costs of hip fracture may vary considerably and different decisions may be reached regarding the introduction of new healthcare interventions.","[Leal, Jose; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Manetti, Stefania] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, Pisa, Italy",University of Oxford; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Buchanan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",james.buchanan@dph.ox.ac.uk,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Manetti, Stefania/JEF-4313-2023","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Manetti, Stefania/0000-0002-9652-8293; Leal, Jose/0000-0001-7870-6730",NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme [11/1023/01],NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme,This project was funded by the NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme (project number 11/1023/01).,,21,12,12,1,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36,10,,,,,1263,1272,,10.1007/s40273-018-0673-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0673-y,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29785689,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000444007800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a structural version of this model where the driver variables of the STUR coefficient are endogenous, the NLLS estimate of the STUR parameter is inconsistent, as are the corresponding estimates of the associated covariance parameters. This paper develops a nonlinear instrumental variable (NLIV) as well as GMM estimators of the STUR parameter which conveniently addresses endogeneity. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators and establish consistency under similar orthogonality and relevance conditions to those used in the linear model. An overidentification test and its asymptotic distribution are also developed. The results enable inference about structural STUR models and a mechanism for testing the local STUR model against a simple UR null, which complements usual UR tests. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators of the STUR parameter as well as the test for overidentifying restrictions perform well in small samples and that the distribution of the NLIV estimator is heavily leptokurtic with a limit theory which has Cauchy- like tails. Comparisons of STUR coefficient and standard UR coefficient tests show that the one-sided UR test performs poorly against the one-sided STUR coefficient test both as the sample size and departures from the null rise. The results are applied to study the relationships between stock returns and bond spread changes.","[Lieberman, Offer] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Phillips, Peter C.

We argue that the two types of aid may respond differently to security challenges because of donors' disparate objectives and aid-giving motives. The results show that armed conflict reduces the amounts of obtained aid of all types, conditional on a. country being an aid recipient. Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country. When we disaggregate aid flows by their purposes, we find that international and domestic terrorism are associated with increases in bilateral aid for promotion of governance, education, health and society.

By defining an escort-space model using the spatial relationships between home, the workplace, and school, this study focuses on the daily modal split among parental chauffeurs using data from Qujing, China, while focusing on the effects of different escort-space models: spatial aggregation, job-housing separation and school-housing separation. The descriptive statistics of parental chauffeurs' travel mode choices under the influences of these three escort-space models are presented. The statistical results demonstrate that the modal splits of parental chauffeurs perform significantly differently under these three escort-space models. Furthermore, the determinants of the daily travel mode of parental chauffeurs, including escort-spaces and other selected variables, are investigated using a multinomial logit model. A model without the escort-space model is also presented for comparison. The results show that the model with the escort-space model has a more significant goodness-of-fit than the model without the escort-space model. Both the job-housing separation and school-housing separation of parental chauffeurs result in the increase of car trips, while the usage amount of car in daily journeys is higher than that in escort trips. Moreover, car ownership, bike ownership, household income, residential location, age, gender, income, and education level all significantly impact the daily travel mode choices of parental chauffeurs. These findings can help policymakers create suitable policies to reduce excessive car trips by parental chauffeurs.","[Liu, Yang; Shi, Zhuangbin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yanjie] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Baohong] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Chenggong Campus, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiyang] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Kunming University of Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Ji, YJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kmliuyang@seu.edu.cn; jiyanjie@seu.edu.cn; shizhuangbin@gmail.com; haoziyy@sina.com; tsql@leeds.ac.uk,"li, yang/IQV-3559-2023; Liu, Qiyang/GRX-2678-2022","Liu, Qiyang/0000-0003-0953-7050; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7863-9371",Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51338003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYLX16_0270]; Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University [YBJJ1842]; EPSRC [EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51338003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. KYLX16_0270) and the Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University (No. YBJJ1842) are gratefully acknowledged.",,48,18,19,8,53,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

It focuses on a 2006 reform of the environmental impact assessment process and adopts a triple-differences approach that compares treated and untreated sectors across states with different levels of environmental stringency. Results based on firm-level data for the period 1998-2012 show that the decentralization induced a decrease in firm births in states with stricter enforcement. The findings draw attention to the consequences of large disparities in enforcement capacity when fostering decentralization.,"[Lovo, Stefania] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Lovo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England.",s.lovo@reading.ac.uk,,"Lovo, Stefania/0000-0001-6231-4142",Global Green Growth Institute; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy,Global Green Growth Institute; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy,"I thank Hendrik Wolff, Teevrat Garg, Matt Khan, Phoebe Koundouri, and the two anonymous reviewers of this journal for the very helpful comments and suggestions.

The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65 years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations.","[Lucas, Karen; Philips, Ian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, 378 Abercrombie St, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Ma, Liang] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res Global Urban & Social Studies, Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Leeds; University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lucas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",k.lucas@leeds.ac.uk,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Ma, Liang/L-1363-2016","Ma, Liang/0000-0002-3013-4726; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017",Economic and Social Research Council of the UK; Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at the University of Sydney; Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority; ESRC [ES/J00023X/2] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council of the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at the University of Sydney; Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK and was undertaken in close collaboration with Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority, who funded the survey component of the project.

A central issue in ridesharing, which is also important in the general domain of cost-sharing in economics and computer science, is that the sharing of cost implies positive externalities and hence coordination problems for the network users. We investigate these problems experimentally in the present study. In particular, we focus on how sequential observability of transportation mode choices can be a powerful facilitator of coordination in ridesharing. Our study abstracts the essential issues of coordination in ridesharing into a directed network game with experimentally testable predictions. In line with the theoretical analysis, our experimental evidence shows that even a limited extent of sequential choice observability might lead to efficient coordination. However, convergence to efficiency is slower with more limited observability, resulting in a significant increase in travel cost.","[Mak, Vincent] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Seale, Darryl A.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Box 456001,4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Gisches, Eyran J.; Rapoport, Amnon] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Cheng, Meng; Moon, Myounghee; Yang, Rui] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Cambridge; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gisches, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",eyran@email.arizona.edu; amnon@email.arizona.edu,,,NSF [SES-1418923]; University of Arizona,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Arizona,"This research was supported by NSF Grant SES-1418923 awarded to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and University of Arizona.",,37,3,4,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85,3-4,,,,,407,433,,10.1007/s11238-018-9663-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-018-9663-y,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000448446600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The unpredictability of conventional fuel markets makes the revenues and costs associated with biofuel production uncertain. In addition, policy uncertainty, in the form of annual revisions and adjustments to the program, make the cost of complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard uncertain. This paper is the first to decompose the aggregate uncertainty facing biofuel producers and isolate the effect of fuel market uncertainty and policy uncertainty on the decision to enter and exit the biofuel market. Results indicate that the uncertainty in the conventional fuel markets and the uncertainty in status of the Renewable Fuel Standard program influence incentives to enter and exit the biofuel market in different ways. Annual adjustments to the standard coupled with the unpredictable expiration and reinstatement of blender tax credits can work to discourage investment in biofuels and undermine effectiveness of the program.

In this paper, we develop an alternative version of the search frictions model that incorporates insights from behavioural economics. We derive a model in which endogenous real wage rigidity emerges from optimal wage-setting and show that this model can match the observed volatility of unemployment. Thus our proposed model can match the data as closely as the existing literature but without the disadvantage of assuming exogenous and ad hoc forms of real wage rigidity.","[Martin, Christopher] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Wang, Bingsong] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Bath; University of Warwick,"Martin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",c.i.martin@bath.ac.uk,,"Martin, Chris/0000-0001-7861-8968",,,,,60,3,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Duality between the primal and dual problems is established. Consequently, the optimal strategy of this consumption and investment problem is identified without assuming several technical conditions on market models, utility specifications, and agent's admissible strategies.

ISPOR's Economic Evaluation of Vaccines Designed to Prevent Infectious Disease: Good Practices Task Force wrote guidelines for three analytic methods and solicited comments on them from external reviewers. Cost-effectiveness analyses use decision-analytic models to estimate cumulative changes in resource use, costs, and changes in quality- or disability-adjusted life-years attributable to changes in disease outcomes. Constrained optimization modeling uses a mathematical objective function to be optimized (e.g. disease cases avoided) for a target population for a set of interventions including vaccination programs within established constraints. Fiscal health modeling estimates changes in net present value of government revenues and expenditures attributable to changes in disease outcomes. The task force recommends that those designing economic analyses for new vaccination programs take into account the decision maker's policy objectives and country-specific decision context when estimating: uptake rate in the target population; vaccination program's impact on disease cases in the population over time using a dynamic transmission epidemiologic model; vaccination program implementation and operating costs; and the changes in costs and health outcomes of the target disease(s). The three approaches to economic analysis are complementary and can be used alone or together to estimate a vaccination program's economic value for national, regional, or subregional decision makers in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Standaert, Baudouin] GSK Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium; [Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.] Global Market Access Solut LLC, Geneva, Switzerland; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Garrison, Louis P.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hutubessy, Raymond] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med & Publ Hlth, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Pitman, Richard] ICON, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Revill, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Groningen; University of York - UK; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; World Health Organization; ICON plc; University of York - UK; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Int, RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,"Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; Revill, Paul/0000-0001-8632-0600",World Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),,,81,79,81,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21,10,,,,,1133,1149,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.08.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.08.005,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314613,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000446871600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The article reviews the characteristics of mission-oriented programs, ooks at key features of those programs that can provide lessons, and discusses how to choose and implement mission-oriented policies, with an example.","[Mazzucato, Mariana] UCL, UCL Inst Innovat & Publ Purpose, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL Inst Innovat & Publ Purpose, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.mazzucato@ucl.ac.uk,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011","Valderrama.G, J.Mario/0009-0000-0951-5383; Urshela-Palacios, Justin/0009-0009-4455-3591; Lazaro, Maria/0009-0006-9105-5964; Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000; Munevar, Laura/0009-0005-5070-9717",,,,,48,405,432,20,141,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Methods: A systematic literature review identified randomized controlled trials comparing enzalutamide, abiraterone/prednisone, radium-223, sipuleucel-T, or docetaxel with each other or placebo in chemotherapy-naive or mixed populations (with and without prior chemotherapy) with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Feasibility assessment evaluated the trials' suitability for NMA inclusion. The main outcomes were hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Results: Searches of relevant bibliographic databases, trial registers, Web sites, and conference abstracts conducted in October 2014 identified 25,712 records. Ten randomized controlled trials were eligible for the NMA. Enzalutamide was superior to placebo for OS and rPFS (fixed-effects model). NMA results (fixed-effects model) showed no evidence of a difference between enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone (HR 0.95 [95% CrI 0.77-1.16]), sipuleucel-T (HR 1.07 [95% CrI 0.84-1.37]), or radium-223 (HR 1.10 [95% CrI 0.87-1.37]) for OS. HRs were similar for the random-effects model. Nevertheless, results (fixed-effects model) suggested that enzalutamide was superior to abiraterone/prednisone (HR 0.59 [95% CrI 0.48-0.72]) and sipuleucel-T (HR 0.32 [95% CrI 0.25-0.42]) for rPFS. Results also suggested superiority of enzalutamide versus placebo, abiraterone/prednisone, or sipuleucel-T for time to chemotherapy. Conclusions: For rPFS, the NMA suggests that enzalutamide is superior to abiraterone/prednisone and sipuleucel-T. There is no evidence of a statistically significant difference in OS between enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone, sipuleucel-T, or radium-223. Given the limitations in network construction and underlying assumptions made to complete these analyses, results should be interpreted with caution.","[McCool, Rachael; Glanville, Julie; Arber, Mick] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Fleetwood, Kelly] Quantics, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Goodall, Howard] Jazz Pharmaceut, Oxford, England; [Naidoo, Shevani] Astellas Pharma Inc, Chertsey, England",University of York - UK; Jazz Pharmaceuticals,"McCool, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",rachael.mccool@york.ac.uk,"Fleetwood, Kelly/GSD-5711-2022; Glanville, Julie/ADR-6508-2022","Glanville, Julie/0000-0002-1253-8524",,,,,48,18,18,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21,10,,,,,1259,1268,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.012,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314628,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000446871600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis, which links producers and final consumers, is a widely-used method for quantifying the EEIT. However, the role of intermediate trade in driving changes in the EEIT is still not fully incorporated in MRIO analysis and as a result poorly understood. Here, we present a framework that separately identifies the drivers of the emissions embodied in the trade of final and intermediate products. We implement this framework in a case study in which we analyse the changes in CO2 emissions embodied in interprovincial trade in China from 2007 to 2012. We find that the largest changes are a rising final demand, which is associated with increased emissions that are to some extent offset by decreasing emissions intensity and changing interregional dependency. The rising imports and the growth in final demand in less developed regions in the north and central (e.g., Hebei and Henan) led to reductions in the CO2 emissions outsourced by central coastal regions. The framework enriches our understanding of the role played by intermediate trade in the relocation of emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using a regression discontinuity design and data from Finnish local elections, we find that ranking first within a party enhances a politician's chances of getting promoted to the position of a municipal board chair, the most important task in Finnish local politics. Other ranks matter less. We document that the effect of ranking first is larger when there is less within-party competition, but the role of external competition is ambiguous. Our evidence suggests that the mechanism behind the rank effects is primarily unrelated to electoral incentives but rather to party-specific norms or political culture. Ranks seem to be, however, only a complement to other promotion criteria such as politicians' previous political experience or how close to the party lines their policy positions stand.","[Merilainen, Jaakko] Stockholm Univ, IIES, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tukiainen, Janne] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Tukiainen, Janne] VATT Inst Econ Res, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Stockholm University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Meriläinen, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, IIES, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",jaakko.merilainen@iies.su.se; janne.tukiainen@vatt.fi,"Tukiainen, Janne Tuomas/JXN-2934-2024","Tukiainen, Janne Tuomas/0000-0003-2534-657X; Merilainen, Jaakko/0000-0003-4700-3850",Emil Aaltonen Foundation,Emil Aaltonen Foundation,"We thank two anonymous referees, editors William F.

We extend the analysis and reassess the results reported in Lucas (2000) and Ireland (2009), also considering the recent theoretical contributions of Lucas and Nicolini (2015) and Berentsen, Huber, and Marchesiani (2015). Breaks in the long-run money demand give rise to regime-dependent welfare cost estimates. We find that the welfare cost is about 0.1% of annual income over 1976-2013, as compared to 0.8% over 1945-75. Overall, these values are substantially lower than those reported in the literature.","[Mogliani, Matteo] Banque France, Paris, France; [Urga, Giovanni] Cass Business Sch, London, England; [Urga, Giovanni] Bergamo Univ, Bergamo, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of France; City University London; University of Bergamo,"Mogliani, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",matteo.mogliani@banque-france.fr; g.urga@city.ac.uk,,"Urga, Giovanni/0000-0002-6742-7370",,,,,53,9,9,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We add interactive fixed effects in the form of a factor structure on the unobserved product characteristics. The interactive fixed effects can be arbitrarily correlated with the observed product characteristics (including price), which accommodate endogeneity and, at the same time, capture strong persistence in market shares across products and markets. We propose a two-step least squares-minimum distance (LS-MD) procedure to calculate the estimator. Our estimator is easy to compute, and Monte Carlo simulations show that it performs well.

Spatial autocorrelation tests are applied in order to identify any spatial organisation in registrations rates and spatial regression models are specified to consider the effect of socioeconomic, household, and transport system characteristics over registrations. Specific attention is paid to the association between Electric Vehicle registrations and the presence of charging infrastructure to consider if registrations are affected by infrastructure in the immediate and intermediate vicinity. The results of the analysis suggest Electric Vehicle demand exhibits a moderate degree of spatial clustering, which indicates the emergence of lead and laggard markets, and that the spatial variation in Electric Vehicle uptake can be partially explained through other characteristics of the local authorities. Characteristics relating to education level, employment status, income level, population density, dwelling type, household size, car availability, and the presence of Hybrid Electric Vehicles are significant factors in explaining the rate of Electric Vehicle registrations. Moreover, the level of charge point infrastructure installed within a local authority is positively associated with EV demand. From a policy perspective, the results reported in this paper indicate that local conditions are likely to be important in the rate of Electric Vehicle adoption, which may be of use when considering the development of geographically targeted interventions to accelerate Electric Vehicle demand.","[Morton, Craig] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Transport Studies Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Cottrill, Caitlin] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Transport Res, St Marys Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland; [Yeboah, Godwin] Univ Warwick, Ctr Interdisciplinary Methodol, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Loughborough University; University of Leeds; University of Aberdeen; University of Warwick,"Morton, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Transport Studies Grp, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.morton@live.co.uk,"Yeboah, Godwin/D-5080-2015; Cottrill, Caitlin/V-3813-2019","Yeboah, Godwin/0000-0003-4618-3175; Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Cottrill, Caitlin/0000-0002-1638-8113","ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland; EPSRC [EP/J004758/1, EP/K000438/1, EP/R035288/1, EP/K000438/2] Funding Source: UKRI",ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The research reporting in this paper was made possible due to a grant provided by the ClimateXChange Centre of Scotland.

J,"Mosse, D",,,,"Mosse, David",,,Caste and development: Contemporary perspectives on a structure of discrimination and advantage,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,India; Caste; Inequality; Discrimination; Economic development; Policy,AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INDIA; NETWORKS; IDENTITY; GENDER; LABOR; PERFORMANCE; INEQUALITY; HIERARCHY,"Inherited caste identity is an important determinant of life opportunity for a fifth of the world's population, but is not given the same significance in global development policy debates as gender, race, age, religion or other identity characteristics. This review asks why addressing caste-based inequality and discrimination does not feature in intergovernmental commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and whether it should. Taking India as its focus, it finds that caste has been treated as an archaic system and source of historical disadvantage due compensation through affirmative action in ways that overlook its continuing importance as a structure of advantage and of discrimination in the modern economy, especially post-liberalization from the 1990s. A body of recent literature from anthropology, economics, history and political science is used to explore the modern life of caste in society, economy and development. Questions are asked about caste as social hierarchy, the role of caste in post-liberalization rural inequality, in urban labor markets and in the business economy, and the effect of policies of affirmative action in public-sector education and employment. Caste is found to be a complex institution, simultaneously weakened and revived by current economic and political forces; it is a contributor to persisting national socioeconomic and human capital disparities, and has major impacts on subjective wellbeing. Caste effects are not locational; they travel from the village to the city and into virtually all markets. Caste persists in the age of the market because of its advantages - its discriminations allow opportunity hoarding for others; and the threat of the advancement of subordinated groups provokes humiliating violence against them. The evidence points to the need for policy innovation to address market and non-market discrimination and to remove barriers, especially in the informal and private sector; and to ensure caste has its proper place in the global development policy debate.

We employed a time-varying structural vector autoregressive (TV-SVA) framework in which the sources of time variation are the coefficients and variance-covariance matrix of the innovations. The quarter frequency data for the period of 1987QII-2017QII is used for the empirical analysis. The key findings suggest that there are substantial differences and asymmetries in the response of these economies to oil shocks. These differences were profound between, and even within, oil exporters and importers. It shows that between major oil exporters i.e. Russia and Brazil the former's economy is rather more intensively influenced by oil prices shocks. Between the two largest net oil importers i.e. India and China, comparatively, the Indian economy seems to be rather more vulnerable to oil prices shocks in terms of their adverse effects on GDP, inflation and balance of trade. The dependence of economies on oil and an increasing level of consumption continue to pose policy challenges for prices and economic stability. The analysis on South Africa also shows negative impacts of oil prices shocks, however, the effects are comparatively more time-variant than other BRICS members. While these asymmetries indicate significant differences in the structure of these economies they also indicate venues of cooperation and stronger trading relationships to overcome the adverse shocks and mutual development.

It argues that the extent of these environmental externalities is contingent upon local industrial agglomeration. Using a panel dataset of 280 Chinese prefectural cities from 2003 to 2012, we employ a spatial economic approach. Although limited to evidence from soot and SO2 pollutants, our results suggest that FDI brings overall positive environmental knowledge externalities to a region, and also spillovers to nearby regions. Specialised cities may lock into a particular technological path, attenuating the absorption and diffusion of a variety of FDI environmental knowledge. Conversely, diversified cities promote cross-fertilisation of environmental knowledge and mitigate local pollution intensity at the aggregated city level. This study adds to the literature by highlighting the importance of considering both the spatiality of FDI and industrial structure in understanding FDI environmental knowledge spillovers.","[Ning, Lutao; Wang, Fan] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Ning, LT (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",L.ning@qmul.ac.uk; fan.wang@qmul.ac.uk,,"Ning, Lutao/0000-0002-9620-0554",,,,,83,51,51,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this paper, we extend the analysis to allow for nonlinear dynamics and volatility changes across exchange rate regimes. Our findings suggest that long-run relationships in line with standard international business cycle models do exist for many Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Further, Monte Carlo experiments illustrate that the nonlinear models can generate the Backus and Smith and the exchange rate disconnect puzzles. In this paper, we also contribute to the nonlinear real exchange rate literature by establishing a theoretical relationship between volatility and persistence. In accordance with the theoretical results, our empirical findings suggest that the increase in volatility in the post-Bretton Woods era is associated with relatively fast mean reversion of the real rate toward its equilibrium value.","[Pavlidis, Efthymios G.; Paya, Ivan; Peel, David A.] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Paya, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",i.paya@lancaster.ac.uk,"; Paya, Ivan/K-4059-2012","Peel, David/0000-0001-5281-2041; Pavlidis, Efthymios/0000-0002-4892-1955; Paya, Ivan/0000-0002-2857-057X",,,,,29,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

While solar generation comes in many forms, 'shared solar', or a community-based system with an array size intermediate between a large-field and an individual residential system, offers many advantages that utility-scale projects are not able to deliver. The aim of this paper is to examine the development of shared solar initiatives in the recent history of US energy policy in order to reveal lessons that could be applied to future renewable energy generation in other developed nations including the UK and other European countries. Specifically the paper offers original appraisal of the 'solar gardens' scheme being trialled in Minnesota, drawing on findings from a survey with over 650 respondents representing a range of local renewable energy organizations and their customers. We examine the salience and influence of four key factors, namely: (i) perceived individual benefits; (ii) sources and trustworthiness of information; (iii) location; and (iv) project financing. Taken together the findings contribute understanding on the potential for community solar projects to assist in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.","[Peters, Michael] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England; [Fudge, Shane] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [High-Pipper, Angela; Hoffman, Steven M.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Polit Sci, St Paul, MN USA; [Carragher, Vincent] Trinity Coll Dublin, Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland",University of Reading; University of Exeter; University of St Thomas Minnesota; Trinity College Dublin,"Peters, M (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England.",m.d.peters@reading.ac.uk; s.fudge@exeter.ac.uk; ahighpippe@stthomas.edu; vincent.carragher@tcd.ie,,,,,,,59,29,32,1,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121,,,,,,355,364,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.022,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000445983800036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The only mathematical prerequisite is a version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: a sequence in a compact subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space has a convergent subsequence with a limit in that set. Our main tool is a 'no-bullying' lemma for agents with preferences over indivisible goods. What does this lemma claim? Consider a finite number of children, each with a single indivisible good (a toy) and preferences over those toys. Let us say that a group of children, possibly after exchanging toys, could bully some poor kid if all group members find their own current toy better than the toy of this victim. The no-bullying lemma asserts that some group S of children can redistribute their toys among themselves in such a way that all members of S get their favorite toy from 5, but they cannot bully anyone.

Exploiting as-good-as-random variation in news content before a verdict, we find that sentences are 3 months longer when the verdict is reached after coverage of crime. Sentences increase with media exposure to crime, not crime itself, and the effect tapers off quickly.

We measure market exposure by a portfolio of tanker, dry bulk, container, and gas stocks to examine tail behavior and tail risk dependence. The role of mixture distributions in predicting future volatility is studied from both statistical and economic perspectives. We further test for predictability in co-movements in the tails of sectors returns. Findings indicate that large losses are strongly correlated, supporting asymmetric transmission processes for financial contagion. Finally, using a non-parametric approach, we extend the model to the multivariate case and assess the value of volatility and correlation timing in optimal portfolio selection. The results can help to improve the understanding of time-varying volatility, correlation and tail systemic risk of shipping stock markets, and consequently, have implications for risk management and asset allocation practices, as well as regulatory policies.","[Pouliasis, Panos K.; Papapostolou, Nikos C.; Kyriakou, Ioannis] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England; [Visvikis, Ilias D.] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",City University London; American University of Sharjah,"Pouliasis, PK (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Fac Finance, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",p_pouliasis@city.ac.uk,"Kyriakou, Ioannis/J-6079-2019; Pouliasis, Panos/AAE-1093-2020","Kyriakou, Ioannis/0000-0001-9592-596X; Pouliasis, Panos/0000-0002-7389-3722; VISVIKIS, ILIAS/0000-0002-6116-6755",,,,,89,13,14,2,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper explores whether the use of a new HIV prevention product, with 100% efficacy but modeled after pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), could change the price and quantity of condomless commercial sex supplied. We collected stated preference data from 122 HIV-negative female sex workers in urban South Africa, using a repeated choice experiment to simulate the impact of using PrEP on choices. Results suggest that the price premium for condomless sex would decrease by 73% with PrEP use and the quantity of condomless sex is predicted to increase by a factor of 2.27. Act price does not significantly affect choices without protection but strongly influences choices under full HIV protection. The utility offered by condoms reduces by around 15% under PrEP use. Because new HIV prevention products do not protect against other STIs or pregnancy, the unintended consequences of introducing HIV prevention products should be closely monitored, whereas users should not face stigma or blame for reacting rationally to exogenous changes to market conditions.","[Quaife, Matthew; Eakle, Robyn; Terris-Prestholt, Fern] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Quaife, Matthew; Eakle, Robyn; Cabrera-Escobar, Maria A.; Delany-Moretlwe, Sinead] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits RHI, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Vickerman, Peter] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Manian, Shanthi] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Witwatersrand; University of Bristol; Washington State University,"Quaife, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",matthew.quaife@lshtm.ac.uk,"Quaife, Matthew/O-4754-2015","Quaife, Matthew/0000-0001-9291-1511; Manian, Shanthi/0000-0002-0013-5138; Vickerman, Peter/0000-0002-8291-5890; Terris-Prestholt, Fern/0000-0003-1693-5196",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Studentship",,61,11,14,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27,10,,,,,1550,1566,,10.1002/hec.3784,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3784,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29926508,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000443806600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Evidence Review Group (ERG), the School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield, produced a document summarising the key points from the company submission alongside a critical review. Efficacy for progression-free survival (PFS) and safety was positively demonstrated in the pivotal GADOLIN trial, which compared obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance (O-Benda+O) against bendamustine monotherapy. Data on overall survival were immature. The company submitted a model-based economic analysis, including a patient access scheme. The ERG identified a number of limitations, in particular the absence of subgroup analysis and the approach used by the company to estimate overall survival (OS), which was more favourable to the intervention arm. The key uncertainty was the duration of the treatment effect on OS. This uncertainty is expected to be reduced when the final analysis of the GADOLIN trial is reported. Consequently, the NICE appraisal committee recommended O-Benda+O in the population covered by the marketing authorisation within the Cancer Drug Fund until NICE is able to review the guidance following publication of the final analysis of GADOLIN.","[Rafia, Rachid; Pandor, Abdullah; Davis, Sarah; Stevens, John W.; Harnan, Sue; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Sorour, Youssef; Cutting, Robert] Barnsley Hosp NHS Trust, Haematol, Barnsley S75 2EP, England",University of Sheffield,"Rafia, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.rafia@sheffield.ac.uk,"Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010; Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [14/177/09 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 14/177/09 STA).

Moreover, these concerns have prompted the need to develop alternatives to hydrocarbon fuels, leading to the expectation that fuel cell vehicle numbers will similarly increase. However, the variable and intermittent output of RE generators significantly affects the capability for electricity networks to balance supply and demand, although this may be addressed through energy storage and demand-side response (DSR) technologies. One potential DSR technique that can be implemented at industrial scale is water electrolysis, which is used for hydrogen production. When electrolyser operation is modulated, for example, to respond to the variable output of wind and solar power sources, it can be exploited as a dispatchable demand load. Naturally, this would need to be incentivized by electricity tariff structures that reflect the dynamics of RE availability. This paper aims to compare the economics of continuous and dispatchable electrolyser operation for producing affordable hydrogen at garage forecourts in Libya, while ensuring no interruption in the fuel supply to vehicles. Using the coastal city of Derna as a case study, with renewable energy generated by a wind farm, a suitable turbine specification and the number of turbines needed to meet demand was determined through an analysis of wind speeds. The constantly varying difference between RE power supply and electricity demand on the grinded the surplus power at any given time. Using a linear programming algorithm to optimize the hydrogen cost, based on the current price of electricity, this study examines a hydrogen refuelling station in both dispatchable and continuous operation. As the capital cost is already known, the optimisation focuses on the variable cost in order to reduce the price of hydrogen, which means using the cheaper of two electricity tariffs. Three scenarios were considered to evaluate whether the cost of electrolytic hydrogen could be reduced through using lower-cost off-peak electricity supplies: 1- Standard Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a standard tariff of $16/kWh. 2- Off-peak Only, in which the electrolyser operates only during off-peak periods at the lower price of $7 /kWh. 3- 2-Tier Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a low tariff at off-peak times and a high tariff at other times. The results indicate that Scenario 2 produced the cheapest electricity at $3.89 per kg of hydrogen, followed by Scenario 3 at $5.10 per kg, and the most expensive was Scenario 1 at $9.26 per kg.","[Rahil, Abdulla; Gammon, Rupert; Brown, Neil] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Queens Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Rahil, A (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Queens Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",p13063959@my365.dmu.ac.uk; rgammon@dmu.ac.uk; NBrown@dmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,4,4,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

According to those, waste should be disposed as close as possible to where it has been produced. A likely effect of such provision is to prevent competition from neighbouring areas and increase the market power of local disposers, with possible undesirable consequences for other firms in the vertical chain. We show through a simple spatial model that one additional effect of the Proximity Principle and of the Self-Sufficiency Principle is to provide an incentive to collectors and waste producers to increase the amount of separated waste.","[Reggiani, Carlo] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Silvestri, Francesco] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Savonarola 9, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",University of Manchester; University of Ferrara,"Reggiani, C (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",carlo.reggiani@manchester.ac.uk; slvfnc1@unife.it,,"Reggiani, Carlo/0000-0002-5069-3592",,,,,29,6,6,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the case of deterministic demand and constant marginal cost, reducing a price cap yields increased total output, consumer welfare, and total welfare, results consistent with those for oligopoly markets with a fixed number of firms. With deterministic demand and increasing marginal cost, these comparative static results may be fully reversed, and a welfare-improving cap may not exist. Recent results in the literature show that for a fixed number of firms, if demand is stochastic and marginal cost is constant, then lowering a price cap may either increase or decrease output and welfare (locally); however, a welfare-improving price cap does exist. In contrast to these recent results, we show that a welfare-improving cap may not exist if entry is endogenous. However, within this stochastic demand environment we show that certain restrictions on the curvature of demand are sufficient to ensure the existence of a welfare-improving cap when entry is endogenous.","[Reynolds, Stanley S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rietzke, David] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England",University of Arizona; Lancaster University,"Reynolds, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",reynolds@eller.arizona.edu; d.rietzke@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Rietzke, David/0000-0002-8108-1396",,,,,17,12,13,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We use the model to construct indexes of firm-level demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in all three dimension with demand being the most dispersed. The firm-specific demand and marginal cost components account for over 30% of market share variation, 40% of sales variation, and over 50% of price variation among exporters. The fixed cost index is the primary factor explaining differences in the pattern of destination markets across firms. The estimates are used to analyse the supply reallocation following the removal of the quota on Chinese footwear exports to the EU. This led to a rapid restructuring of export supply sources on both the intensive and extensive margins in favour of firms with high demand and low fixed costs indexes, with marginal cost differences not being important.","[Roberts, Mark J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Roberts, Mark J.; Xu, Daniel Yi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Daniel Yi] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Fan, Xiaoyan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shengxing] London Sch Econ, London, England",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Fudan University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES-1125963]; ESRC [ES/P004237/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Amit Khandelwal, Jan De Loecker, the editor Stephane Bonhomme, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

The fractional stochastic trends allow for a wide range of nonstationarity, indexed by a memory parameter, nesting the familiar 1(1) case and allowing for parametric short-memory. The individual effects can nonparametrically vary simultaneously across time and across units. The cross-sectional covariance matrix is also nonparametric. The main focus is on estimation of the time series parameters. Two methods are considered, both of which entail an only approximate differencing out of the individual effects, leaving an error which has to be taken account of in our theory. In both cases we obtain standard asymptotics, with a central limit theorem, over a wide range of possible parameter values, unlike the nonstandard asymptotics for autoregressive parameter estimates at a unit root. For statistical inference, consistent estimation of the limiting covariance matrix of the parameter estimates requires consistent estimation of a functional of the cross-sectional covariance matrix. We examine efficiency loss due to cross-sectional correlation in a spatial model example. A Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst there are some high-level estimates of the potential for buildings energy efficiency in the UK, a more granular assessment is needed to understand exactly where this potential lies and what form it takes. Our analysis fills this gap. It is based on the best available evidence on the remaining potential for energy efficiency improvements within UK residential buildings. Using UK government criteria for investment appraisal, we demonstrate that there is a significant resource of untapped energy-saving opportunities in UK homes. Specifically, our estimates suggest that: one quarter of the energy currently used in UK households could be cost effectively saved by 2035; and this could increase to one half if allowance is made for falling technology costs and the wider benefits of energy efficiency improvements. However, these estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made about capital, energy and carbon costs, and capturing this potential will require both significant policy change and large-scale investment.","[Rosenow, Jan; Sorrell, Steven] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rosenow, Jan; Eyre, Nick] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Rosenow, Jan] Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Guertler, Pedro] E3G, 47 Great Guildford St, London SE1 0ES, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.;Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",j.rosenow@sussex.ac.uk; pedro.guertler@e3g.org,"Rosenow, Jan/GOJ-9750-2022",,"Research Councils UK [EP/K011790/1]; EPSRC [EP/R035288/1, EP/K011790/1, EP/R014965/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Research Councils UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This paper was enabled through funding from Research Councils UK through their support for the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (Grant no.

Methods: A large online survey was conducted using a discrete choice experiment including a duration attribute with adult members of the Netherlands general population (N = 1276) who were representative in terms of age, gender, marital status, employment, education, and region. Respondents were asked which of two health states they prefer, where each health state was described using the nine dimensions of the Child Health Utility 9D (worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, school work/homework, sleep, daily routine, able to join in activities) and duration. The data were modeled using conditional logit with robust standard errors to produce utility values for every health state described by the Child Health Utility 9D. Results: The majority of the dimension level coefficients were monotonic, leading to a decrease in utility as severity increases. There was, however, evidence of some logical inconsistencies, particularly for the school work/homework dimension. The value set produced was based on the ordered model and ranges from -0.568 for the worst state to 1 for the best state. Conclusion: The valuation of the Child Health Utility 9D using online discrete choice experiment with duration with adult members of the Dutch general population was feasible and produced a valid model for use in cost utility analysis. Normative questions are raised around the valuation of pediatric preference-based measures, including the appropriate perspective for imagining hypothetical pediatric health states.","[Rowen, Donna; Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Vermaire, Jan Hendrik] TNO Child Hlth, Oral Hlth Div, Leiden, Netherlands; [Vermaire, Jan Hendrik] Univ Groningen, Ctr Tandheelkunde & Mondzorgkunde, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Sheffield; University of Technology Sydney; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; University of Groningen,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,"Stevens, Katherine J/E-4679-2010","Vermaire, J.H.

Why and how did they fail to predict the scale of the challenge to the European Union manifest in the Leave vote of the referendum? Mainly supportive of the hegemony of the European Union and its vision of social progress, social scientists have propagated a view of normality which legitimizes that hegemony through the interpretation of its cultural opposition as irrational, emotional and populist. While the cultural tensions driving the Leave victory have been extensively documented, the implications of this long-standing divide for the UK state, the party system and democratic citizenship have received only limited attention from university intellectuals. In their commitment to the European Union hegemony, they have interpreted the cultural challenge in ways likely only to increase its strength.","[Salter, Brian] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Salter, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2 2LS, England.",brian.g.salter@kcl.ac.uk,,"Salter, Brian/0000-0002-0779-2712",,,,,123,6,6,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

J,"Schotte, S; Zizzamia, R; Leibbrandt, M",,,,"Schotte, Simone; Zizzamia, Rocco; Leibbrandt, Murray",,,A poverty dynamics approach to social stratification: The South African case,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,South Africa; Social stratification; Middle class; Poverty dynamics; Vulnerability to poverty,MIDDLE-CLASS; TRANSITION-PROBABILITIES; TRANSIENT POVERTY; RURAL CHINA; VULNERABILITY; DEFINITION; INEQUALITY; SELECTION; PANEL,"The wave of upbeat stories on the developing world's emerging middle class has reinvigorated a debate on how social class in general and the middle class in particular ought to be defined and measured. In the economics literature, most scholars agree that being middle class entails being free from poverty, which means being able to afford the basic things in life - not only today, but also tomorrow. In consequence, there is an increasing tendency to define the middle class based on a lack of vulnerability to poverty. In this paper, we strengthen and expand on these existing approaches in three ways: First, we incorporate the differentiation between the middle class and a (non-poor) vulnerable group into a broader social-stratification schema that additionally differentiates between transient and chronic poverty. Second, in estimating the risk of poverty, we employ a multivariate regression model that explicitly allows for possible feedback effects from past poverty experiences and accounts for the potential endo-geneity of initial conditions, unobserved heterogeneity, and non-random panel attrition - four factors insufficiently addressed in existing studies. Third, we highlight the value of paying attention to these conceptual and modelling issues by showing that class divisions based on monetary thresholds inadequately capture a household's chances of upward and downward mobility. We then apply our conceptual framework to the South African case. We find that only one in four South Africans can be considered stably middle class or elite. Access to stable labor market income is a key determinant of achieving economic stability. A lack of jobs as well as the prevalence of precarious forms of work drive high levels of vulnerability, which in turn constrains the development of an emergent middle class - not only in South Africa but potentially also in other parts of the developing world that face similar labor market challenges.

The evidence indicates that they have been over-represented in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. This is arguably transitory and there should be good prospects of upward mobility. Over-qualification among A8 migrants, measured using the Annual Population Survey data, is examined in this article. The findings show that A8 migrants have been subject to migration penalties at the high end of the UK labour market. There are persistent labour market disadvantages for A8 migrants in the UK and their over-qualification may be a long-term concern.","[Sirkeci, Ibrahim] Regents Univ London, Transnat Studies, London, England; [Sirkeci, Ibrahim] Regents Univ London, Regents Ctr Transnat Studies, Regents Pk, London NW1 4NS, England; [Acik, Necla] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Acik, Necla] Univ Manchester, Ctr Criminol & Criminal Justice, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Saunders, Bradley] Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Univ, Khobar, Saudi Arabia; [Privara, Andrej] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Social Dev & Labour, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University; University of Economics Bratislava,"Sirkeci, I (通讯作者)，Regents Univ London, Regents Ctr Transnat Studies, Regents Pk, London NW1 4NS, England.",sirkecii@regents.ac.uk,"Saunders, Bradley/GLU-4268-2022; Sirkeci, Ibrahim/F-1065-2012","Saunders, Bradley/0000-0002-2037-9113; Sirkeci, Ibrahim/0000-0002-2334-7424",,,,,50,18,18,5,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To study this we measure rural poverty by counting people who live in darkness at night: combining high-resolution global satellite data on night-time lights and population from 2000 to 2013. We develop a measure that accurately identifies 74% of households as above or below the extreme poverty line when compared to over 600,000 household surveys. We find that both high oil prices and new discoveries increase illumination and GDP nationally. However, they also promote regional inequality because the increases are limited to towns and cities with no evidence that they benefit the rural poor.","[Smith, Brock] Montana State Univ, Dept Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Sydney; Australian National University,"Smith, B (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",brock.smith1@montana.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009303/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009303/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K009303/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Brock Smith is in the Department of Economics, Montana State University, USA (brock.smith1@montana.edu).
