Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters.

The STA was a review of NICE's 2015 guidance (TA360) in which Nab-Pac+Gem was not recommended for patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The review was prompted by a proposed Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount on the price of Nab-Pac and new evidence that might lead to a change in the guidance. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarises the ERG's review of the company's evidence submission for Nab-Pac+Gem, and the Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The final scope issued by NICE listed three comparators: gemcitabine monotherapy (Gem), gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine (Gem+Cap), and a combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil (FOLFIRINOX). Clinical evidence for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem was from the phase III CA046 randomized controlled trial. Analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) showed statistically significant improvement for patients treated with Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem. Clinical evidence for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus FOLFIRINOX and versus Gem+Cap was derived from a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results of the NMA did not indicate a statistically significant difference in OS or PFS for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus either Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX. The ERG's main concerns with the clinical effectiveness evidence were difficulties in identifying the patient population for whom treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem is most appropriate, and violation of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption in the CA046 trial. The ERG highlighted methodological issues in the cost-effectiveness analysis pertaining to the modelling of survival outcomes, estimation of drug costs and double counting of adverse-event disutilities. The AC accepted all the ERG's amendments to the company's cost-effectiveness model; however, these did not make important differences to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The company's base-case ICER was 46,932 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem. Treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem was dominated both by treatment with Gem+Cap and with FOLFIRINOX in the company's base case. The AC concluded that the most plausible ICER for treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem was in the range of 41,000- pound 46,000 pound per QALY gained. The AC concluded that Nab-Pac+Gem was not cost effective compared with Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX, and accepted that treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem met the end-of-life criteria versus Gem but did not consider Nab-Pac+Gem to meet the end-of-life criteria compared with Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX. The AC also concluded that although patients who would receive Nab-Pac+Gem rather than FOLFIRINOX or Gem+Cap were difficult to distinguish, they were identifiable in clinical practice. The AC recommended treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem for patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer for whom other combination chemotherapies were unsuitable and who would otherwise receive Gem.","[Stainthorpe, Angela; Greenhalgh, Janette; Bagust, Adrian; Richardson, Marty; Boland, Angela; Beale, Sophie; Duarte, Rui; Kotas, Eleanor; Palmer, Daniel] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Banks, Lindsay] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Stainthorpe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",angela.stainthorpe@liverpool.ac.uk,"Duarte, Rui/C-9635-2012","Duarte, Rui/0000-0001-6485-7415; Richardson, Marty/0000-0002-7097-8704; Stainthorpe, Angela/0000-0002-2531-9371",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme [14/90/01],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme,"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme (project number 14/90/01; see the Health Technology Assessment programme website for further project information, http://www.hta.ac.uk).

I discuss how these decisions are typically made and argue that the amount of sample data and regulatory authorities' concerns over multiplicity are irrelevant when making reimbursement decisions. Decision analytic models (DAMs) are usually necessary to meet the requirements of an economic evaluation. DAMs involve inputs relating to health benefits and resource use that represent unknown true population parameters. Evidence about parameters may come from a variety of sources, including RCTs, and uncertainty about parameters is represented by their joint posterior distribution. Any impact of multiplicity is mitigated through the prior distribution. I illustrate my perspective with three examples: the estimation of a treatment effect on a rare event; the number of RCTs available in a meta-analysis; and the estimation of population mean overall survival. I conclude by recommending that reimbursement decisions should be followed by an assessment of the value of sample information and the DAM revised structurally as necessary and to include any new sample data that may be generated.","[Stevens, John W.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Stevens, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",j.w.stevens@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36,10,,,,,1135,1141,,10.1007/s40273-018-0681-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0681-y,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29926358,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000444007800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It aims to minimize the difficulties that working women face because of giving birth and to protect the health of mothers and their babies. Most research on MP around the world is carried out in larger organizations in developed countries. This cannot be applied uncritically to developing countries, where work in small firms and the informal economy tends to dominate and enterprises are more influenced by their local communities and environment. This paper explores different forms of MP found in various forms and sizes of enterprise in Ghana. Specifically, it examines 1) how workplaces in the formal and informal economy manage MP and 2) how reciprocity shapes workers' access to the different forms of MP support. The paper draws on 63 qualitative interviews with employers and women employees across three geographic regions of Ghana. The findings show that there are a range of measures related to pregnancy, maternity leave, family-friendly flexible working conditions, breastfeeding and childcare. While large formal economy organizations mostly offer MP measures corresponding to regulatory entitlements, women working in small informal economy businesses often only benefit from informal MP support. However, neither statutory nor informal supports alone provide adequately for women's needs. The paper highlights the important roles of reciprocity and relationships built on trust as conditions for family-friendly MP provisions, particularly in the informal economy workplaces. It concludes by identifying lessons that can be learnt by both formal and informal economy businesses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty is evident at all stages of the project development, as the concept emerges and as it moves through the subsequent assessment and decision processes. This research has investigated and demonstrated a method that quantifies the factors contributing to uncertainty, focussing on the early stages of the project lifecycle. The method used a back-cast scenario to describe a future view of a transport project. The causal relationships between elements of the planning and decision processes that led to the scenarios were discussed in structured interviews with stakeholders, and each conversation was coded using qualitative analysis techniques to identify the active elements of the process. Causality between the elements was explored to evaluate their influences and dependencies with those elements found to be simultaneously both highly influential and highly dependent were identified as those driving uncertainty. The sensitivity of the analytical element of this process to its parameters was also examined to quantify their contribution to the uncertainty in the analysis and to establish robust values for these parameters. The specific scenario presented here was based on a disused railway where several 'studies evaluating its re-opening have resulted in contradictory views on its mode of use and on the achievable benefits. In the scenario, the rail service is re-instated for light rail use in conjunction with a new sustainable urban area anchored on an existing small village. In this case, the results showed that local politics and leadership were the most influential factors in the project while the economic environment, the utility of the proposal, and planning policy contributed most to the uncertainties in the project. Although these results emerged from a specific scenario, the methodology was demonstrated to be a powerful generic tool to identify the elements that create criticalities in the planning and decision process. Therefore, the integrated method has application in other areas of project inception and planning, much wider than in the transport application demonstrated here.

Objectives: To examine how dominance tests have been implemented in recent DCE applications in health and discuss their theoretical and empirical interpretation. Methods: Health-related DCEs published in 2015 were reviewed for the inclusion of tests on choice behavior. For studies that implemented a dominance test, information on application and interpretation of the test was extracted. Authors were contacted for test choice sets and observed proportions of subjects who chose the dominated option. Coefficients corresponding to the choice set were extracted to estimate the expected probability of choosing the dominated option with a logistic model and compared with the observed proportion. The theoretical range of expected probabilities of possible dominance tests was calculated. Results: Of 112 health-related DCEs, 49% included at least one test for choice behavior; 28 studies (25%) included a dominance test. The proportion of subjects in each study who chose the dominated option ranged from 0% to 21%. In 46% of the studies, the dominance test led to the exclusion of participants. In the 15 choice sets that were analyzed, 2 had larger proportions of participants choosing the dominated option than expected (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Although dominance tests are frequently applied in DCEs, there is no consensus on how to account for them in data analysis and interpretation. Comparison of expected and observed proportions of participants failing the test might be indicative of DCE quality.","[Tervonen, Tommi; Schmidt-Ott, Tabea; Marsh, Kevin] Evidera, 1 Butterwick,Metro Bldg,6th Floor, London W6 8DL, England; [Schmidt-Ott, Tabea; Quaife, Matthew] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Bridges, John F.

Nutritional information is seen as an effective tool to help fight obesity and its associated co-morbidities, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, for which unhealthy diet represent a major preventable risk factor. This paper explores the influence of FoPL formats on consumer's stated choice of weekly food baskets using data from a discrete choice experiment carried out in Northern Ireland in 2011. Two of the three baskets were experimentally designed while the third represented the respondent's actual current food choice (or status-quo basket). Four nutritional attributes were used: (i) total fat, (ii) saturated fat, (iii) salt, and (iv) sugar. Baskets were portrayed at different price levels to elicit the sensitivity of choice to price and to derive marginal willingness to pay estimates. Results from random utility models with various forms of heterogeneity reject the null of no association between preference classes and healthier food baskets and also the null of no effect of the nutritional information described. We find that the influence of the FoPL format used to convey nutritional information combines with selected socio-demographic covariates to determine membership to preference classes. A sensitivity analysis is used to validate the preferred model and the response sensitivity of selection probabilities to potential policy levers, such as a more realistic appreciation of self-body image and the habit of reading labels.","[Thiene, Mara] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Longo, Alberto; Hutchinson, William George] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst, IGFS, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Padua; Durham University; University of Verona; University of Waikato; Queens University Belfast,"Thiene, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",mara.thiene@unipd.it; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk; a.longo@qub.ac.uk; g.hutchinson@qub.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009; Thiene, Mara/H-1866-2014","Thiene, Mara/0000-0003-3265-5426","UKCRC [RES-590-28-0001, MR/K023241/1]; Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52587-R]","UKCRC; Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","Funding for this research was provided by the UKCRC, grants number RES-590-28-0001 and MR/K023241/1, by the Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland, and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grant No. ECO2014-52587-R.",,93,24,25,6,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2018,80,,,,,,84,102,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.09.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.09.004,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GZ1PO,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000449140200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is demonstrated via three robust counterexamples, that in this setting the law of one price fails, thus showing, contrary to longstanding belief in the literature, that price dispersion in large market games is extremely robust. Most importantly, it is established that even in economies with a continuum of small agents and infinitely many atoms (all of whom can arbitrage prices if they so wish), and an infinite number of markets per commodity, the set of equilibria and the resulting market structure is influenced, both by strategic behaviour, and private ownership of posts.

First, the variation in log real hourly wages is decomposed into three components reflecting worker, firm, and job title characteristics and a residual element. It is found that worker permanent heterogeneity is the most important source of wage variation accounting for one third of the wage variance, while firm permanent effects contribute one fourth. Job title fixed effects still explain a considerable one fifth of wage variance. Second, having established that high-wage workers tend to match with high-paying firms, worker fixed effects from the wage equation are next correlated with firm fixed effects from sales and value-added production equations to provide unambiguous evidence on the sign and strength of assortative matching. The correlations are positive and large, indicating that higher productivity workers tend to match with higher productivity firms.","[Torres, Sonia] Stat Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC USA; [Portugal, Pedro; Addison, John T.; Guimaraes, Paulo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Addison, John T.] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro] Nova SBE, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Durham University; Universidade do Porto; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal.",sonia.torres@ine.pt; pportugal@bportugal.pt; ecceaddi@moore.sc.edu; pfguimaraes@bportugal.pt,"Portugal, Pedro/M-7216-2019; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008","Portugal, Pedro/0000-0001-8298-6683; Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028",,,,,49,7,8,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54,,,,,,47,60,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.004,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000447577200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The saving response can be positive or negative. If the mean lag for the impact of the catastrophe is long enough, the saving response will be negative, because the precautionary return in the Keynes-Ramsey rule becomes negative. We also show the separate effects of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and the relative risk aversion (RRA) using Duffie- Epstein preferences. Focusing on a productivity catastrophe, we calibrate our model and show how sensitive the policy responses are to the degrees of EIS and RRA, the trend rate of economic growth, the hazard rate, and how long it takes for the catastrophe to have its full impact.

Patch-working' - the reliance on supplementary forms of income to support business activity - is often seen as a means of cushioning the financial vulnerability of small firms. However, the mechanisms and forms that patch-working takes tend to be overlooked. Evidence from 42 West Midlands' firms shows that, despite the highly constrained operating environment, the exercise of social agency can help to cushion against disadvantage and to rework their current conditions through patch-working. This allows for business growth, and even transformational growth in some cases, rather than sheer survival. Even so, our findings show that the agency of migrant entrepreneurs brings about only minor improvements in revenue and is certainly not capable of fundamentally changing either the nature of the sector or the structure of the labour market in which they are embedded.","[Villares-Varela, Maria] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Ram, Monder; Jones, Trevor] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Southampton; University of Birmingham,"Villares-Varela, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Social & Human Sci, Bldg 58,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",M.Villares-Varela@soton.ac.uk,"Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021","Ram, Monder/0000-0003-1901-6654; Villares-Varela, Maria/0000-0002-0137-7104",Advantage West Midlands,Advantage West Midlands,This research project was funded by Advantage West Midlands.,,45,21,21,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Together with other social structures they influence the trajectories of societal change. Such factors are however tightly connected and should not be analysed in isolation but considered as interdependent with each other. This study contributes to the understanding of interconnections among institutions and other structural factors by focusing on two features: the manifold nature of linkages and the possibility of relations being asymmetric. An analogy to symbiotic relationships, common in ecology, serves as inspiration for an innovative methodological strategy to empirically study multiple interconnections. Focusing on the Brazilian municipality level, the study includes 54 structural factors in a correlation network. Empirical results include the identification of centroids, meaning most connected factors, which tend to gain or lose importance at higher levels of municipal development; and the identification of positive asymmetric relationships between structural factors, which may inform on system dynamics.","[Von Jacobi, Nadia] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Von Jacobi, Nadia] Univ Pavia, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Pavia, Italy",University of Oxford; University of Pavia,"Von Jacobi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.;Von Jacobi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Pavia, Italy.",nadia.vonjacobi@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"von Jacobi, Nadia/JRY-5666-2023","von Jacobi, Nadia/0000-0003-0306-9524",Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (Laboratorio Expo); EU-FP7 CrESSI grant [613261],Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (Laboratorio Expo); EU-FP7 CrESSI grant,"The author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers, and Geoffrey Hodgson, Samuel Bowles, Ugo Pagano, Thorvald Gran, Renata Targetti, Francesco Scervini and Enrica Chiappero-Martinetti for comments on previous versions.

Methods: All patients newly diagnosed with FL in the UK's population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (www.hmm.org ) between 2004 and 2011 were followed until 2015 (N = 740). Treatment pathways, QALYs, and costs were incorporated into a discrete event simulation to reflect patient heterogeneity, including age and disease management. Two scenario analyses, based on the latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines (rituximab induction therapy for newly diagnosed asymptomatic patients and rituximab maintenance therapy for patients between treatments), were conducted and their economic impacts were compared to current practice. Results: Incidence-based analysis revealed expected average lifetime costs ranging from 6,165 pound [US $7,709] to 63,864 pound [US$79,862] per patient, and average life expectancy from 75 days to 17.56 years. Prevalence-based analysis estimated average annual treatment costs of 60-65 pound million [US$75-80 million], accounting for approximately 10% of the United Kingdom's annual National Health Service budget for hematological cancers as a whole. Assuming that treatment effects reported in trials are applicable to all patient groups, scenario analyses for two recent NICE guidelines demonstrated potential annual cost savings for the United Kingdom that ranged with uptake frequency from 0.6 pound million to 11 pound million [US$0.75-2.75 million]. Conclusions: Costs, survival, and QALYs associated with FL vary markedly with patient characteristics and disease management. Allowing the production of more realistic outcomes across the patient population as a whole, our model addresses this heterogeneity and is a useful tool with which to evaluate new technologies/treatments to support healthcare decision makers.","[Wang, Han-I; Roman, Eve; Crouch, Simon; Smith, Alexandra] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, ECSG, Seebohm Rowntree Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Aas, Eline] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Burton, Cathy] St James Univ Hosp, Haematol Malignancy Diagnost Serv, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Patmore, Russell] Castle Hill Hosp, Queens Ctr Oncol & Haematol, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of York - UK; University of Oslo; Saint James's University Hospital; University of Hull,"Wang, HI (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, ECSG, Seebohm Rowntree Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",han-i.wang@york.ac.uk,,"Roman, Eve/0000-0001-7603-3704",Bloodwise [15037],Bloodwise,The Haematological Malignancy Research Network is funded by Bloodwise: grant reference 15037.

Many commercial and business districts have been planned in the areas surrounding stations. This study examines and critiques the impacts of HSR on commercial land markets in Jiangsu: a pioneering province for HSR development in China. After considering various locational and contextual factors, this study focuses specifically on how HSR stations and the frequency of train services have affected the dynamics of commercial land markets, using a spatial panel approach. The results show that the opening of HSR services has significantly impacted trade volumes, while the frequency of train services has significantly affected trade prices. Further analysis shows variation in the impacts of HSR stations and train service frequency on commercial land markets between Jiangsu's developed south and less-developed central and northern sub-regions. The findings suggest that the study of HSR impacts is sensitive to the selected spatial scale. Moreover, HSR development may not result in the creation of dynamic commercial economies for every city. Consequently, locally based policies are needed to take advantage of the transport-induced opportunities.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Manchester Urban Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Yuan, Feng; Duan, Xuejun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Duan, XJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk; xjduan@niglas.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20161088]","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province)","This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20161088).

Although such falls are more common for the elderly and increase the cost of medical care, they also reduce younger passengers' satisfaction for the service. This study investigates the differences between natural gait and that resulting from the bus environment. Twenty-nine regular bus users, between 20 and 80 years old, were invited to participate in a series of experiments. Their natural gait whilst walking on a flat surface was monitored in a static laboratory and was compared to their gait whilst walking on the lower deck of a moving bus. A medium level of acceleration (1.5 m/s(2)) was examined, which falls in the range of accelerations experienced by passengers on the real bus service in London. A new method of measuring and analysing gait in dynamic environments was established. Chi-square tests were conducted on measures of changes in gait (step type), which encloses important information about body balance, considering participants' age and gender and the bus acceleration. The statistical analysis has shown that as acceleration increases bus passengers use more three-peak steps, which denote that the entire foot is under pressure and in full contact with the ground, thus increasing balance. This is the first study investigating people's gait inside moving vehicles, hence the gait of healthy people was examined so that the differences in walking patterns would be unaffected by health-related conditions, and to increase understanding of the real challenges passengers experience during bus journeys. The presented methods and outcomes can be used to improve research around eliminating risk of falling for people with mobility difficulties.","[Xenia, Karekla; Nick, Tyler] UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Xenia, K (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",x.karekla@ucl.ac.uk,,"Tyler, Nick/0000-0001-7079-1301; Karekla, Xenia/0000-0001-7889-361X",,,,,27,2,2,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We first explore the typical equilibrium mode-choice patterns with exogenous city boundary and population distribution, and then incorporate the residents' mode choice into an urban spatial equilibrium model, in which the residents' household consumption, the residential location choice and the property developers' housing production are also explicitly modeled. Using comparative static analysis, we find that the urban corridor expands with the increase of railway fare if there is no congestion in the bimodal transportation system, but it's not necessarily the case if highway congestion and transit crowding cannot be ignored. We provide numerical evidence to show that the urban corridor possibly shrinks with the increase of railway fare once congestion effects are considered. We also discuss the changes of urban form, utility level of residents and social welfare with different railway fare and subsidy policies. Numerical results show that the distance-based fare policy with low subsidy should be preferred because it can realize the Pareto-improved social welfare and utility level of residents.","[Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Tian-Liang; Huang, Hai-Jun] Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Ronghui] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Beihang University; University of Leeds,"Liu, TL (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",liutianliang@buaa.edu.cn,"Huang, Hai-Jun/AAP-2269-2020","Huang, Hai-Jun/0000-0002-9001-9172",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project [RSSB-T1071]; Royal Academy of Engineering [UK-CIAPP/286]; China Scholarship Council,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project; Royal Academy of Engineering(Royal Academy of Engineering - UK); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The research described in this paper was jointly supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71771007), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project RSSB-T1071 and the Royal Academy of Engineering Newton Fund project UK-CIAPP/286.

Based on 49328 inspection reports from Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) (2015-2017), we present a Bayesian Network (BN) model to determine vessel detention rates after adding company performance as a new indicator in PSC inspection. A strategic game model is formulated by incorporating the BN model outcomes. The optimal inspection rate from the game model can help improve port authority performance in PSC.

J,"Zacarés, JM",,,,"Zacares, Javier Moreno",,,Beyond market dependence: The origins of capitalism in Catalonia,JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Catalonia; political Marxism; proto-industry; transition debate,,"Buried in the footnotes of his famous 1976 essay, Robert Brenner left the remark that Catalonia had experienced an agrarian transition to capitalism in parallel to England. This important claim has been completely forgotten by his followers of the political Marxist tradition, who since then have developed his views on the origins of capitalism. Building on the specialist literature, this article revisits the question of the Catalan transition through the prism of political Marxism and teases out its implications. In particular, it argues that the Catalan case illustrates the centrality of agency and subjectivity in the process of capitalist change. Contrary to Brenner's claim, this paper will argue that pre-capitalist social property relations persisted in agriculture throughout the period of transition. Instead, the region's capitalist breakthrough was prompted by sociocultural struggles in its 18th-century proto-industry.","[Zacares, Javier Moreno] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Zacarés, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.moreno-zacares@warwick.ac.uk,,"Moreno Zacares, Javier/0000-0001-5918-3081",,,,,55,10,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Evidence from a multiple bubble test,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hub pricing; Bubbles; Natural gas; Oil indexation,CRUDE-OIL; MARKET FUNDAMENTALS; PRICES; ENERGY; STOCK; FINANCIALIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FUTURES; IMPACT; SHOCKS,"Oil indexation and hub-based pricing are two competing pricing mechanisms in the international natural gas markets. The debates over whether hub-based pricing is preferable to oil indexation have become intense among academics and practitioners, for example, whether and when East Asia should adopt hub pricing. This paper contributes empirically to the debate using a multiple bubble test. Adopting the generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller test proposed by Phillips et al. (2015), we show that more explosive bubbles exist in Japan and European gas prices than in the US prices. The argument is that hub-based pricing mechanism can better reflect fundamental values in the gas markets and thus is less subject to speculations. Given the recent trend of financialization in energy markets, gas prices are more likely to deviate from fundamental values when they are not clear to investors. Although oil indexation is simple and has been an effective tool over the past few decades, our results suggest that hub pricing is associated with less extreme price movements in the market and thus is a better choice for both policy makers and practitioners.

Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogota has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogota and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.","[Guzman, Luis A.] Univ Los Andes, Grp Sostenibilidad Urbana & Reg, SUR, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Edificio Mario Laserna Cra 1 Este 19a-40, Bogota, Colombia; [Oviedo, Daniel] UCL, Dev Planning Unit, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of London; University College London,"Guzman, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Grp Sostenibilidad Urbana & Reg, SUR, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Edificio Mario Laserna Cra 1 Este 19a-40, Bogota, Colombia.",la.guzman@uniandes.edu.co; d.oviedo.11@ucl.ac.uk,"Guzman, Luis A./F-7201-2019; Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/AGJ-6328-2022; Guzmán, Luis/HLH-3515-2023","Guzman, Luis A./0000-0002-6487-7579; Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/0000-0002-5692-6633;",World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"We would like to express our gratitude to the World Bank, for the funding a project called Accessibility and affordability impact evaluation of Bogota's SITP, which was the origin for the development of this paper.",,44,107,114,7,81,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We develop a three-location spatial applied general equilibrium model calibrated to the 2001 Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix to examine the impact of various public investment programs on household welfare across this diverse geography in which production and consumption are locationally specific and transport costs support equilibrium price differences across locations. We examine how different public investment packages combined with reforms in the transport sector alter the equilibrium structure and location of economic activity. The choice of financing arrangement matters for welfare, since tax incidence, relative price, and real exchange rate movements are non neutral. We show that the distributional consequences of alternative investment programs may matter more in terms of household welfare than the direct consequences of targeting investment to particular sectors or locations. For instance, under some financing scenarios, interventions that aid agriculture may lead to decreases in the welfare of the rural unskilled labor force, because the financing mechanisms create distortions that effectively skew the terms of trade sufficiently powerfully against the rural unskilled as to outweigh the direct welfare-enhancing effects of the public investment. We also note that welfare gains are generated by the movement of rural workers out of quasi-subsistence agriculture into higher productivity jobs in other sectors and locations.

Early methods developed to identify these social effects assumed that networks had formed exogenously, and were perfectly observed, both of which are unlikely to hold in practice. A more recent literature, both within economics and in other disciplines, develops methods that relax these assumptions. This paper reviews that literature. It starts by providing a general econometric framework for linear models of social effects, and illustrates how network endogeneity and missing data on the network complicate identification of social effects. Thereafter, it discusses methods for overcoming the problems caused by endogenous formation of networks. Finally, it outlines the stark consequences of missing data on measures of the network, and regression parameters, before describing potential solutions.","[Advani, Arun] Univ Warwick, Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Advani, Arun] CAGE, London, England; [Malde, Bansi] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Malde, Bansi] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick; University of Kent; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Malde, B (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England.;Malde, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",b.k.malde@kent.ac.uk,,"Malde, Bansi/0000-0003-1323-3383; Advani, Arun/0000-0002-4131-0609","ESRC-NCRM Node 'Programme Evaluation for Policy Analysis' [ES/I03685X/1]; ESRC [ES/K00123X/1]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/I02574X/1, ES/K00123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC-NCRM Node 'Programme Evaluation for Policy Analysis'(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Imran Rasul for his support and guidance on this project.

Inspired by ROSCAs, we offer different credit and saving contracts to subjects. We find that individuals often accept both credit and saving contract across experimental waves. This behaviour can be rationalised by assuming that individuals seek lump-sum payments and struggle to hold savings. Structural estimation of this model accounts for the behaviour of 75% of participants. Of these, two-thirds have high demand for lump-sum accumulation but savings difficulties. These results imply that the distinction between microlending and microsaving is largely illusory.","Lahore Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; Milan Politecn, Milan, Italy; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",Lahore School of Economics; Stanford University; University of Oxford,"Quinn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",simon.quinn@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"d'ADDA, GIOVANNA/0000-0002-2327-8481",UK Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the programme for Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth (iiG); Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations [RIDIE-STUDY-ID-528385f5d3034],UK Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the programme for Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth (iiG); Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations,"This project was funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the programme for Improving Institutions for Pro-Poor Growth (iiG).

The lecture argues that by contrast these aspects can be addressed by the Schumpeterian growth paradigm in which: (i) growth results primarily from innovation; (ii) innovation responds to incentives shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations replace old technologies (creative destruction).","[Aghion, Philippe] Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Aghion, Philippe] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universite PSL; College de France; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.;Aghion, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,3,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The HBP aims to create a digital research infrastructure for brain science, cognitive neuroscience, and brain-inspired computing. This paper builds on work undertaken in the HBP's Ethics and Society subproject (SP12). Collaborators from two activities in SP12, Foresight and Researcher Awareness on the one hand, and Ethics Management on the other, use the case of machine intelligence to illustrate key aspects of the dynamic processes through which questions of ethics and society, including existential risks, are approached in the organisational context of the HBP. The overall aim of the paper is to provide practice-based evidence, enriched by self-reflexive assessment of the approach used and its limitations, for guiding policy makers and communities who are, and will be, engaging with such questions.","[Aicardi, Christine] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London, England; [Fothergill, B.

Self-control and saving habit were tested as additional factors that potentially moderate the relationship between constructs representing reflective and impulsive processes and behavior, or exert indirect effects on behavior through these systems. A community sample of 594 participants completed measures of saving intention, buying impulsiveness. trait self-control, saving automaticity, and propensity to save money. A well-fitting variance-based structural equation model, goodness-of-fit index = 0.338, average path coefficient = .119, p < .001, accounted for statistically significant amounts of variance in the key dependent variables: intention to save, R-2 = .364, buying impulsiveness. R-2 = .232, and saving behavior, R-2 = .173. Self-control and saving habit were indirectly related to saving behavior through intention, and buying impulsiveness was directly related to behavior when saving habits were low. Findings indicate strong saving habits may help to protect against impulsive spending and offer several targets for interventions aimed at improving saving behavior.","[Allom, Vanessa; Mullan, Barbara Ann; Monds, Lauren; Hamilton, Kyra; Rebar, Amanda L.; Hagger, Martin S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia; [Orbell, Sheina] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester, Essex, England; [Hamilton, Kyra] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Rebar, Amanda L.] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Hlth & Human Res, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia; [Hagger, Martin S.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Sport & Hlth Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland",Curtin University; University of Essex; Griffith University; Central Queensland University; University of Jyvaskyla,"Mullan, BA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia.",barbara.mullan@curtin.edu.au,"Hagger, Martin S./G-5211-2012; Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Hagger, Martin S./0000-0002-2685-1546; Rebar, Amanda/0000-0003-3164-993X; Orbell, Sheina/0000-0002-8665-3541; Hamilton, Kyra/0000-0001-9975-685X; Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899",,,,,73,20,24,7,50,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Evidence from UK Twins,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; Obesity; Gene-environment interactions; Twins,BODY-MASS; DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY; BIRTH-WEIGHT; ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; STRATIFICATION; INHERITANCE; ATTAINMENT; SMOKING; US,"More education is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and likelihood of being obese. Obesity and BMI also have a strong genetic basis. Given these observations, we investigate whether more education can reduce obesity by attenuating the underlying genetic risk of being obese, through gene environment (GxE) interactions. We estimate associations between (i) education, (ii) a genetic risk score (GRS) and (iii) GxE interactions between education and the GRS through Ordinary least Squares (OLS) and twins fixed-effect regressions using data on female twins from the TwinsUK database. OLS estimates show that there are significant associations of education and genetics. Female twins with a university education are 14.3 percentage points less likely to be obese compared to twins with less than compulsory education, and a 1 standard deviation increase in the GRS increases the likelihood of being obese by 5.2 percentage points. The GxE interactions are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the marginal association of the GRS with obesity does not differ by educational attainment. When controlling for confounding through twins fixed-effects, we find a smaller role of genetics. The association of the GRS with obesity decreases to 0.040. Associations of educational attainment are substantially reduced and insignificant. GxE interactions also remain insignificant. Overall, we find little evidence of any GxE interactions.

We consider six versions of Battle-of-the-Sexes. Recommendations imply monetary payoffs that are equal ex ante, but unequal ex post. So, although following recommendations constitutes a Nash equilibrium under standard preferences, sufficiently inequity-averse players can rationally disobey a recommendation that would lead to a very unfavourable payoff distribution, as long as the cost of doing so is not too large. Our theoretical model incorporates inequity aversion, along with level-k reasoning. Our main experimental result is consistent with the model: as either payoff asymmetry increases or the cost of disobeying an unfavourable recommendation decreases, subjects are more likely to disobey recommendations.

A common approach to evaluate the opportunity cost of providing an environmental good is the exploitation of the distance function's dual relationship to the value function. This implies that the opportunity cost is assumed to be non-negative. This approach also requires a convex technology set. Focusing on crop diversification for a balanced sample of 44 cereal farms in the East of England for the years 2007-2013, this paper develops a novel opportunity cost measure that does not depend on these strong assumptions.

A new system dynamics model has been created. The World Energy Model (WEM) is based on the World3 model (The Limits to Growth, Meadows et al., 2004) with climate change and energy production replacing generic pollution and resources factors. WEM also tracks global population, food production and industrial output out to the year 2100. This paper presents a series of WEM's projections; each of which represent broad sweeps of what the future may bring. All scenarios project that global industrial output will continue growing until 2100. Scenarios based on current energy trends lead to a 50% increase in the average cost of energy production and 2.4-2.7 degrees C of global warming by 2100. WEM projects that limiting global warming to 2 degrees C will reduce the industrial output growth rate by 0.1-0.2%. However, WEM also plots industrial decline by 2150 for cases of uncontrolled climate change or increased population growth. The general behaviour of WEM is far more stable than World3 but its results still support the call for a managed decline in society's ecological footprint.","[Ansell, Thomas; Cayzer, Steve] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Ansell, T (通讯作者)，Pinhead House,Old Barnstaple Rd, Bideford EX39 4NF, Devon, England.",tomansell1@hotmail.com,"Cayzer, Steve/GLU-8192-2022","Cayzer, Steve/0000-0002-9854-289X",University of Bath,University of Bath,This work was supported by the University of Bath,,57,34,35,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,514,525,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.053,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440123300048,View Full Record in Web of Science

We check sources of performance for Israeli corporate and government bond funds, which together account for above 70% of the Israeli mutual fund market, using a unique monthly database of approximately 10-years. Our results reveal that active management is far more important than policy for corporate bond fund returns, which is mainly attributable to managers' security selection skills. The reverse is true for government bond funds and strategic long term policies account for a larger part of excess market return variability. Furthermore, if we take into account management fees, government bond funds lose from active management. The greater heterogeneity of investments open to corporate bond funds is a possible explanation for the difference in results. Copyright (C) 2018, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

We present two case studies based on the experience of the authors in promoting active learning in two large-class undergraduate modules in Introductory Macroeconomics and Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia. Both case-studies are based on a flipping model with in-class active learning delivered through peer instruction. However, the experience of each author differs in the way the teaching approach was introduced and integrated with additional pedagogies to meet specific needs of the student population, as well as the desired learning outcomes for both modules. In the Introductory Macroeconomics case-study, we discuss how combining peer instruction with a self-assessment component can support the development of students' metacognitive skills. In the Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry case-study, we demonstrate that peer instruction questions can be co-designed in partnership with students to foster engagement and challenge misconceptions. We argue that peer instruction can be used as an effective, scalable, and easily adaptable active learning pedagogy in many different learning environments. Reflecting on our experience, as well as the student voice, our concluding discussion considers: (i) the importance of careful question design, (ii) the role of audience response technologies, as well as (iii) present and future challenges to the promotion of active learning approaches in Higher Education.","[Arico, Fabio R.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lancaster, Simon J.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Chem, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Aricò, FR (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Lancaster, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Chem, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",F.Arico@uea.ac.uk; S.Lancaster@uea.ac.uk,,,University of East Anglia,University of East Anglia,"The authors are grateful for the support of The University of East Anglia and the counsel of Neil Ward, Adam Longcroft and Helena Gillespie.

The main source of clinical effectiveness data about IXA-LEN-DEX came from the Tourmaline-MM1 randomized controlled trial in which 771 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma received either IXA-LEN-DEX or placebo-LEN-DEX as their second-, third-, or fourth-line treatment. Takeda estimated the cost effectiveness of IXA-LEN-DEX using a de-novo partitioned-survival model with three health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and dead). In their first submission, this model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. bortezomib plus dexamethasone (BORT-DEX) in second-line treatment, and of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. LEN-DEX in third-line treatment. To estimate the relative clinical performance of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. BORT-DEX, Takeda conducted network meta-analyses for important outcomes. The network meta-analysis for overall survival was found to be flawed in several respects, but mainly because a hazard ratio input for one of the studies in the network had been inverted, resulting in a large inflation of the claimed superiority of IXA-LEN-DEX over BORT-DEX and a considerable overestimation of its cost effectiveness. In subsequent submissions, Takeda withdrew second-line treatment as an option for IXA-LEN-DEX. The manufacturer's first submission comparing IXA-LEN-DEX with LEN-DEX for third-line therapy employed Tourmaline-MM1 data from third- and fourth-line patients as proxy for a third-line population. The appraisal committee did not consider this reasonable because randomization in Tourmaline-MM1 was stratified according to one previous treatment and two or more previous treatments. A further deficiency was considered to be the manufacturer's use of interim survival data rather than the most mature data available. A second submission from the company focussed on IXA-LEN-DEX vs. LEN-DEX as third- or fourth-line treatment (the two or more previous lines population) and a new patient access scheme was introduced. Covariate modeling of survival outcomes was proposed using the most mature survival data. The Evidence Review Group's main criticisms of the new evidence included: the utility associated with the pre-progression health state was overestimated, treatment costs of ixazomib were underestimated, survival models were still associated with great uncertainty, leading to clinically implausible anomalies and highly variable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, and the company had not explored a strong assumption that the survival benefit of IXA-LEN-DEX over LEN-DEX would be fully maintained for a further 22 years beyond the observed data, which encompassed only approximately 2.5 years of observation. The appraisal committee remained unconvinced that ixazomib represented a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources. Takeda's third submission offered new base-case parametric models for survival outcomes, a new analysis of utilities, and proposed a commercial access agreement. In a brief critique of the third submission, the Evidence Review Group agreed that the selection of appropriate survival models was problematic and at the request of the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence investigated external sources of evidence regarding survival outcomes. The Evidence Review Group considered that some cost and utility estimates in the submission may have remained biased in favor of ixazomib. As a result of their third appraisal meeting, the committee judged that for the two to three prior therapies population, and at the price agreed in a commercial access agreement, ixazomib had the potential to be cost effective. It was referred to the Cancer Drugs Fund so that further data could accrue with the aim of diminishing the clinical uncertainties.","[Armoiry, Xavier; Connock, Martin; Tsertsvadze, Alexander; Melendez-Torres, G.

A significant size premium emerges, which is stable through time, robust to specification, not concentrated in microcaps, more consistent across seasons, and evident for non-price-based measures of size, and these results hold in 30 different industries and 24 international equity markets.

Each dealer's strategy is represented as a quantity-price schedule. We analyze the effect of trade decentralization and adverse selection on information diffusion, expected profits, trading costs, and welfare. Information diffusion through prices is not affected by dealers' strategic trading motives, and there is an informational externality that constrains the informativeness of prices. Trade decentralization can both increase or decrease welfare. A dealer's trading cost is driven by both her own and her counterparties' centrality.

Methods: This study was a substudy of a broader evaluation of measurement properties of PerfO measures. The PerfO measures assessed were timed up and go (TUG), four-step stair climb (4SC), long stair climb (LSC), and repeated chair stand (RCS). For this substudy, HF and eTHR participants were interviewed to evaluate the relevance and difficulty of each PerfO measure. Qualitative analysis was conducted on interview transcripts, and summaries of coded data were produced to assess saturation. Results: All 18 HF participants related the PerfO measures (TUG, 4SC, and RSC) to activities they completed in daily life, with slight variations in some specific aspects. For the eight eTHR participants, the correspondence between the PerfO measures (TUG, 4SC, and LSC) and activities in daily life varied: all participants saw similarity in the movements for the TUG; most undertook short stair climbs in daily life, but most did not regularly undertake LSC in daily life. Nevertheless, all HF and eTHR participants reported that the PerfO measures were relevant and had a level of difficulty similar to daily activities. Conclusions: This study contributes novel methods that adapt US regulatory guidance for patient-reported outcome measures to the evaluation of PerfO measures. A structured approach was used to explore specific details of each measure and correspondence to everyday life. This study demonstrates how content validity of PerfO measures can be meaningfully assessed.","[Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Kerr, Cicely; Mowbray, Fiona] ICON Clin Res, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Bush, Elizabeth Nicole] Eli Lilly & Co, Patient Focused Outcomes Ctr Expertise, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; Eli Lilly,"Ballinger, R (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res UK Ltd, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",rachel.ballinger@iconplc.com,,"Kerr, Cicely/0000-0003-3921-0841; Mowbray, Fiona/0000-0002-3297-4163",Eli Lilly and Co.,Eli Lilly and Co.(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co.,,12,3,3,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21,9,,,,,1115,1123,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.005,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224117,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000444833500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

We operate under the most flexible definition of piecewise stationarity, and estimate the number and locations of change-points consistently as well as identifying whether they originate in the common or idiosyncratic components. Through the use of wavelets, we transform the problem of change-point detection in the second-order structure of a high-dimensional time series, into the (relatively easier) problem of change-point detection in the means of high-dimensional panel data. Also, our methodology circumvents the difficult issue of the accurate estimation of the true number of factors in the presence of multiple change-points by adopting a screening procedure. We further show that consistent factor analysis is achieved over each segment defined by the change-points estimated by the proposed methodology. In extensive simulation studies, we observe that factor analysis prior to change-point detection improves the detectability of change-points, and identify and describe an interesting 'spillover' effect in which substantial breaks in the idiosyncratic components get, naturally enough, identified as change-points in the common components, which prompts us to regard the corresponding change-points as also acting as a form of 'factors'.

To this end, we investigate the effects of 306 seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) conducted by listed European banks between 2002 and 2014. We use propensity score matching and find that SEOs lead to asset expansion as opposed to any deleveraging. Further, we find a decrease in lending in the short-term followed by a subsequent increase, a reduction in profitability, and an increase in systemic risk. Regulators might not have fully considered this last negative externality when they imposed the tougher Basel III capital requirements. The effects of SEOs strongly depend on the reasons behind the recapitalizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

An important element of classroom flipping is that elements of active learning (e.g. games, experiments and polling) are brought into the classroom setting and that content delivery is moved (at least partially) from the classroom to the virtual learning environment. This paper discusses the developments that have prepared the ground for the increasing uptake of classroom flipping, namely technical innovations and a better appreciation of how students learn. In our view the flipped classroom approach has significant promise beyond the already existing implementations, mostly by enthusiastic teaching staff. As many of the technical challenges have been solved it is now the willingness, the availability of time, and the recognition and reward of any effort to change the delivery approach that will prove to be the most significant hurdles for further adoptions.","[Becker, Ralf] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Birdi, Alvin] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Birdi, Alvin] Econ Network, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Manchester; University of Bristol,"Becker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",ralf.becker@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,4,10,13,2,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

We use unsupervised methods to categorize requests, revealing the diversity of topics including environment, security, budgets, and government procurement and employees. While many topics have clear public accountability-seeking purposes, others are focused on more private, micro-political goals. Analysis over time and across states reveals linkage between information demand and issues of public interest such as environmental impacts and criminal violence.

England voted strongly to leave Europe while Scotland backed remain by 62% to 38%. The Scottish government published its draft bill on a second independence referendum in October 2016. The move does not mean another referendum will definitely be held, but this does raise the possibility that Scotland might choose independence and staying in the EU without the rest of the United Kingdom. If Scotland charts a course of independence from the rest of the United Kingdom, then they would likely either issue their own currency or join or form another currency area. In this paper, we test the microeconomic foundations of a common currency area for Scotland, United Kingdom, and the rest of the United Kingdom without Scotland. We find that the United Kingdom, Scotland, and the United Kingdom without Scotland all meet the microeconomic criteria for a common currency area. In contrast, banking data suggest that lending in Scotland is different from lending in the rest of the United Kingdom, adding some doubt to the issue of whether or not Scotland is a common currency area with the United Kingdom.","[Binner, Jane M.; Chaudhry, Sajid M.; Mullineux, Andrew W.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Swofford, James L.] Univ S Alabama, Mobile, AL USA",University of Birmingham; University of South Alabama,"Binner, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Chaudhry, Sajid/0000-0001-8769-8920",,,,,19,1,1,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Here we study gender differences in altruistic behaviour and, additionally, in expectations of altruistic behaviour, in a sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers living in the US. In Study 1, we report a mega-analysis of more than 3, 500 observations and we show that women are significantly more altruistic than men.

By making two key assumptions about the providers in such markets, namely that they are (partly) motivated and have decreasing marginal utility of income, we find, contrary to the existing literature, an unambiguously negative relationship between competition intensity and quality provision. This relationship holds regardless of whether quality and price decisions are made simultaneously or sequentially.

We obtain explicit links between persistent gaps in productivity growth and the incentives of resource-exporting (importing) countries to subsidize (tax) domestic resource use. The exporters' incentive to subsidize hinges on slower productivity growth and is disconnected from the importers' incentive to tax resource inflows-i.e., rent extraction. Moreover, faster productivity growth exacerbates the importers' incentive to tax, beyond the rent-extraction motive. In a strategic tax game, the only equilibrium is of Stackelberg type and features, for a wide range of parameter values, positive exporters' subsidies and positive importers' taxes at the same time.","[Bretschger, Lucas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Valente, Simone] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, ARTS 3-50, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of East Anglia,"Valente, S (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, ARTS 3-50, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.valente@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In this paper, we combine both strands and estimate time perception and time discounting functions at the individual level in an incentivized controlled laboratory environment. We find a negative and statistically significant correlation between time perception and time discounting: subjects who overestimate objective time intervals are less willing to delay gratification.

A much discussed question in this context is whether voluntary behaviour change initiatives can make a significant contribution to reaching this target. While providing individuals with general information on climate change or low carbon action is increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies argue that personalised information has greater potential to encourage behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this claim through a longitudinal field experiment which tested the effectiveness of a carbon calculator interview. It finds that the intervention significantly raised awareness of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon footprint. However, this increased awareness did not translate into measurable behaviour changes in relation to home energy and travel. Qualitative analysis shows that participants refer to infrastructural, social and psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more ambitious government and corporate action is required to speed up carbon reduction.","[Buchs, Milena] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Bahaj, AbuBakr S.; Blunden, Luke; Bourikas, Leonidas; James, Patrick; Wu, Yue] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Sustainable Energy Res Grp, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Falkingham, Jane] Univ Southampton, Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Kamanda, Mamusu] INDEPTH Network, 38 & 40 Mensah Wood Scree, Accra, Ghana",University of Leeds; University of Southampton; University of Southampton; INDEPTH Network,"Büchs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.m.buchs@leeds.ac.uk; A.S.Bahaj@soton.ac.uk; lsb1@soton.ac.uk; L.Bourikas@soton.ac.uk; J.C.Falkingham@soton.ac.uk; P.A.James@soton.ac.uk; mamusu.kamanda@indepth-network.org; Phil.Wu@soton.ac.uk,"Buchs, Milena/AAU-2581-2021; Bourikas, Leonidas/AAH-6565-2019; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; Blunden, Luke S/F-9749-2011; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Bahaj, AbuBakr/B-9111-2015","Buchs, Milena/0000-0001-6304-3196; Bourikas, Leonidas/0000-0002-5289-2157; Wu, Yue/0000-0002-4112-7935; Blunden, Luke/0000-0002-0046-5508; Bahaj, AbuBakr/0000-0002-0043-6045; JAMES, PATRICK/0000-0002-2694-7054; Falkingham, Jane/0000-0002-7135-5875",UK Engineering and Physical Research Council [EP/J017698/1]; EPSRC [EP/J017698/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This project was funded by UK Engineering and Physical Research Council grant Transforming the Engineering of Cities to Deliver Societal and Planetary Wellbeing, EP/J017698/1.",,54,35,37,4,68,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,284,293,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.030,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440123300027,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, institutions are not always binding, and the degree of institutional bindingness varies across contexts. This article examines the bindingness of village elections in China. Through the lens of land expropriation in pe-urban villages and using survey data, we find that institutional bindingness operationalized in terms of the power structure within village leadership strongly shapes the processes and outcomes of land expropriations and therefore the quality of village governance. Moreover, village power structure depends on political bargaining between ordinary villagers and local states. Our findings contribute to the understanding of quasi-democratic institutions in authoritarian regimes by explicitly examining how institutional bindingness affects governance outcomes and how bindingness is endogenously determined.

The first step is to show that models of industrial interdependencies (in the Leontief and Sraffa formulations) and vertically integrated models (in the Pasinetti formulation) imply profoundly different views on production, distribution, and socio-political conflicts. The next step is to focus on the process of vertical integration in itself on its being a 'bridge' between such different views. Because analytically equivalent representations of economic structures have such different socio-political implications, economic structures cannot be seen as univocally determining economic interests or conflicts in society. This result opens up a new field for structural analysis: studying how the formation of interests in society is influenced, but not determined, by economic structures. The article suggests a route to address the socio-political dimension of economic structures, which is largely left on the background by structural economic analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time these same factors do not relate to the size of the national savings. We use a sample of countries that established a SWF in the period 1998-2008 and compare them to those that did not set up a fund in the same period.

We find evidence of a strong intergenerational transmission through passive smoking and that this is around four times larger for mothers compared to fathers. Moreover, we estimate an intention to treat difference-in-differences (DiD) model using parental cotinine as a continuous measure of exposure to the treatment and we find that the level of transmission of cotinine from parents was reduced to 51 per cent of the previous level just after the spread in the use of e-cigarettes in England and to 77 per cent when considering transmission from mothers. This is confirmed also by a DiD model which considers interaction between cotinine levels and self-reported use of NDP by parents and suggests that lower taxation of these devices may be justified on externality grounds.

Our model combines a differential-game approach with a Hotelling spatial competition framework, and our analysis applies in particular to industries such as long-term care, health care, child care and education. If providers (nursing homes, hospitals, schools, nurseries) use closed-loop decision rules, which imply strategic interaction over time, we show that, although increased competition leads to higher quality in the steady state, quality provision is nevertheless lower than under open-loop rules, and also suboptimally low from a welfare perspective.

Specifically, we propose a data-driven procedure for constructing a class of simultaneous confidence regions for a subset of the entries of a large precision matrix. The confidence regions can be applied to test for specific structures of a precision matrix, and to recover its nonzero components. We first construct an estimator for the precision matrix via penalized node-wise regression. We then develop the Gaussian approximation to approximate the distribution of the maximum difference between the estimated and the true precision coefficients. A computationally feasible parametric bootstrap algorithm is developed to implement the proposed procedure. The theoretical justification is established under the setting which allows temporal dependence among observations.

We study the best subset selection procedure by which the covariates are chosen by maximizing Manski (1975, 1985)'s maximum score objective function subject to a constraint on the maximal number of selected variables. We show that this procedure can be equivalently reformulated as solving a mixed integer optimization problem, which enables computation of the exact or an approximate solution with a definite approximation error bound. In terms of theoretical results, we obtain non-asymptotic upper and lower risk bounds when the dimension of potential covariates is possibly much larger than the sample size. Our upper and lower risk bounds are minimax rate-optimal when the maximal number of selected variables is fixed and does not increase with the sample size. We illustrate usefulness of the best subset binary prediction approach via Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of the work-trip transportation mode choice. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

The smart mobility options include shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus facilities. While previous surveys on smart mobility options had investigated limited number of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the smart mobility options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135 alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design. The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the non-traditional survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional public transport modes are favoured over smart mobility options. These findings, as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement smart mobility options in Lisbon as well as in other cities.

One exception is a recent economics literature using the notion of incomplete markets to estimate the impacts of cattle ownership on children's milk consumption and growth outcomes in Eastern Africa. In addition to external validity concerns, an obvious internal validity concern is that dairy producers may systematically differ from non-dairy households, particularly in terms of latent wealth or nutritional knowledge. We re-examine these concerns by applying a novel double difference model to data from rural Bangladesh, a country with relatively low levels of milk consumption and high rates of stunting. We exploit the fact that a cow's lactation cycles provide an exogenous source of variation in household milk supply, which allows us to distinguish between a control group of households that do not own cows, a treatment group that own cows that have produced milk, and a placebo group of cow owning households that have not produced milk in the past 12 months. We find that household dairy production increases height-for-age Z scores by 0.52 standard deviations in the critical 6-23 month growth window, though in the first year of life we find that household dairy supply is associated with a 21.7 point decline in the rate of breastfeeding. The results therefore suggest that increasing access to dairy products can be extremely beneficial to children's nutrition, but may need to be accompanied by efforts to improve nutritional knowledge and appropriate breastfeeding practices.

We address the potential endogeneity concerns endemic in much of the existing literature by constructing an instrument for power outages based on the varying share of electricity produced by hydro-power as a result of variation in the local climate conditions. Using firm-level data for 14 countries from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we find evidence of a negative relationship between an unreliable electricity supply and firms' sales, with a stronger effect for firms that do not own a generator. We find that reducing average outage levels to those of South Africa would increase overall sales of firms in Sub-Saharan Africa by 85.1%, rising to 117.4% for firms without a generator.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

We use data on 77 Western Cape Province wine grape farms from 2005-2015 to estimate the impacts on employment. Previous post-apartheid labour market reforms increased minimum wages substantially, but re-entry to global markets after sanctions were lifted increased demand and this preserved jobs in the wine sector. However, by 2005 this demand growth had largely ceased. The long-run wage elasticity for permanent employees was found to be -0.4, but for casual workers the figure was -4.7, so the 51% wage increase is likely to decimate casual employment in the future. Thus, the poorest and most vulnerable casual workers lose most in terms of jobs, incomes and secure livelihoods, whereas 80% of full-time staff benefit from the higher minimum wages. Thus, the minimum wage change is likely to increase the gap between privileged permanent staff and casual workers. This result is not surprising in view of the long-standing interdependence between farmers and their permanent workers in wine grape production.","[Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Thirtle, Colin] Imperial Coll London, London, England",University of Cape Town; Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University; Imperial College London,"Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England.;Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,35,1,1,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

In this paper we propose a new procedure for testing optimal monetary policy, relying on moment inequalities that nest commitment and discretion as two special cases.

Several potential explanations are reviewed. It is argued that while some are unpersuasive it is too soon to know which carry the most weight. However, the slowdown does not appear to be an artefact of the data. A key, hotly disputed, issue is the future economic impact of today's technological progress. As with previous general purpose technologies, it is likely that there will be powerful effects but only with a lag. This has the implication that while the slowdown is real it is not necessarily permanent.","[Crafts, Nicholas] Univ Warwick, CAGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Crafts, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, CAGE, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",N.Crafts@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,24,25,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of tariff echoing - after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001-2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The paper therefore begins by examining this possibility of hostile manipulation of the brain in some detail. It then briefly reviews the current state of the chemical and biological arms control and disarmament regime as embodied in the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) following the 2016 8th Five Year Review Conference of the BTWC and in the lead up to the 2018 4th Five Year Review Conference of the CWC. Finally, our civil society initiative to assist in achieving a successful outcome of the 2018 CWC Review Conference is described. This initiative involves the production of a multi-authored edited book, to be published in advance of the Review Conference by the UK Royal Society of Chemistry that explores many of the critical issues facing the CWC States Parties as they seek to agree effective measures to prevent the development and use of chemical weapons, as the life and chemical sciences advance.","[Crowley, Michael; Shang, Lijun; Dando, Malcolm] Univ Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Dando, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.",mrdando@bradford.ac.uk,"Shang, Lijun/AAT-8172-2020","Shang, Lijun/0000-0001-5925-5903",,,,,26,2,2,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102,,,,SI,,125,133,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.006,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000443666900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: In this paper we illustrate the potential utility of these methods for finding optimal solutions to problems in health care delivery and policy. To do so, we selected three award-winning papers in health care delivery or policy development, reflecting a range of optimization algorithms. Two of the three papers are reviewed using the ISPOR Constrained Optimization Good Practice Checklist, adapted from the framework presented in the initial Optimization Task Force Report. The first case study illustrates application of linear programming to determine the optimal mix of screening and vaccination strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The second case illustrates application of the Markov Decision Process to find the optimal strategy for treating type 2 diabetes patients for hypercholesterolemia using statins. The third paper (described in Appendix 1) is used as an educational tool. The goal is to describe the characteristics of a radiation therapy optimization problem and then invite the reader to formulate the mathematical model for solving it. This example is particularly interesting because it lends itself to a range of possible models, including linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming formulations. From the case studies presented, we hope the reader will develop an appreciation for the wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods, as well as the variety of methods available. Conclusions: Constrained optimization methods are informative in providing insights to decision makers about optimal target solutions and the magnitude of the loss of benefit or increased costs associated with the ultimate clinical decision or policy choice. Failing to identify a mathematically superior or optimal solution represents a missed opportunity to improve economic efficiency in the delivery of care and clinical outcomes for patients. The ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force's first report provided an introduction to constrained optimization methods to solve important clinical and health policy problems. This report also outlined the relationship of constrained optimization methods relative to traditional health economic modeling, graphically illustrated a simple formulation, and identified some of the major variants of constrained optimization models, such as linear programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic programming. The second report illustrates the application of constrained optimization methods in health care decision making using three case studies. The studies focus on determining optimal screening and vaccination strategies for cervical cancer, optimal statin start times for diabetes, and an educational case to invite the reader to formulate radiation therapy optimization problems. These illustrate a wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods.","[Crown, William] OptumLabs, Boston, MA USA; [Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh] Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sir, Mustafa Y.; Pasupathy, Kalyan S.] Mayo Clin, Hlth Care Policy & Res, Informat & Decis Engn, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, Rochester, MN USA; [Thokala, Praveen] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Alberta Bone & Joint Hlth Inst, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Fac Sci,Fac Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Tosh, Jonathan C.] DRG Abacus, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ijzerman, Maarten J.] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Enschede, Netherlands; [Ijzerman, Maarten J.] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Hlth Econ & Evidence Synth Unit, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Padula, William V.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD USA",Optum; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Mayo Clinic; University of Sheffield; University of Strathclyde; University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Twente; Luxembourg Institute of Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Pasupathy, KS (通讯作者)，Mayo Clin, Clin Engn Learning Labs, Healthcare Policy & Res, Informat & Decis Engn,Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Deli, Rochester, MN 55904 USA.",pasupathyk@mayo.edu,"Padula, Bill/AGB-4625-2022; IJzerman, Maarten/AAB-6894-2020; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./V-3982-2018","IJzerman, Maarten/0000-0001-5788-5805; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./0000-0002-2021-9574; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",ISPOR,ISPOR,"None of the authors received financial support for their participation in this ISPOR Task Force.

There is a tension between the features that make science productive, and the need to govern geoengineering research, which has thus far gone underappreciated. I emphasize how geoengineering research requires governance which reaches beyond science's traditional boundaries, and moreover requires knowledge which itself reaches beyond what we traditionally expect scientists to know about.

This research examines four aspects of decision-making with respect to heating system upgrades: home-owner decisions on whether to upgrade, decisions on fuel choice, fuel switching patterns, and an examination of the reasons why home-owners make these decisions. Among the key findings are that proximity to energy infrastructure, e.g. gas network, is an important determinant of residential heating systems upgrades, including fuel choice. With one exception no clear trend emerges on the likelihood of a broad range of socio-demographic variables, including age, income, and working status on home-owner decisions. A cohort of home-owners defined across a few socio-demographic characteristics, including mortgage holders, are predisposed to investing in a heating system upgrade compared to their peers but for reasons unknown do not invest. We also find that environmental concerns, across a number of dimensions, are not an important determining factor in either the decision to upgrade or the subsequent choice of heating system. Information on heating system alternatives is critical for good decision-making but we find that home-owners do not always rely on independent energy consultants for guidance.","[Curtis, John; McCoy, Daire; Aravena, Claudia] Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [McCoy, Daire] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Aravena, Claudia] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Heriot Watt University,"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Sir John Rogersons Quay, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; Aravena, Claudia/0009-0002-3905-9184",Science Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2302]; Gas Networks Ireland through the Gas Innovation Group [2015-SR-002]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI - Marine Renewable Energy Ireland Research cluster; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre; Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/K006576/1],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Gas Networks Ireland through the Gas Innovation Group; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI - Marine Renewable Energy Ireland Research cluster(Science Foundation Ireland); ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre; Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research is supported by Science Foundation Ireland under Grant No. 12/RC/2302.

This paper develops a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley's financial balances approach and postulates that private sector's propensity to spend is driven by a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism. It also includes two fiscal rules: a Maastricht-type fiscal rule, according to which the fiscal authorities adjust the government expenditures based on a target net government debt ratio; and a Godley-Minsky fiscal rule, which links government expenditures with private indebtedness following a counter-cyclical logic. The analysis shows that (i) the interaction between the propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type fiscal rule is destabilising while the Godley-Minsky fiscal rule is stabilising; and (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector.","[Dafermos, Yannis] Univ West England, Frenchay Campus, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Dafermos, Y (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Yannis.Dafermos@uwe.ac.uk,,"Dafermos, Yannis/0000-0002-8127-6249",,,,,54,15,17,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We analyse the effects of creating an extra prize by reducing the prize in the main competition. Contestants differ in ability and agents with relatively low ability belong to a disadvantaged minority. All contestants compete for the main prize, but only disadvantaged agents can win the extra prize. We show that an extra prize is a powerful tool to ensure participation of disadvantaged agents. Moreover, for intermediate levels of the disadvantage of the minority, introducing an extra prize increases total equilibrium effort compared to a standard contest. Thus, even a contest designer not interested in affirmative action might establish an extra prize in order to enhance competition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The complex and time varying relationship between oil prices and stock markets has caught the attention of the financial press, investors, policymakers, researchers, and the general public in recent years. In light of such attention, this paper reviews research on the oil price and stock market relationship. The majority of papers we survey study the impacts of oil markets on stock markets, whereas, little research in the reverse direction exists. Our review finds that the causal effects between oil and stock markets depend heavily on whether research is performed using aggregate stock market indices, sectorial indices, or firm-level data and whether stock markets operate in net oil-importing or net oil-exporting countries. Additionally, conclusions vary depending on whether studies use symmetric or asymmetric changes in the price of oil, or whether they focus on unexpected changes in oil prices. Finally, we find that most studies show oil price volatility transmits to stock market volatility, and that including measures of stock market performance improves forecasts of oil prices and oil price volatility. Several important avenues for further research are identified.","[Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England; [Arora, Vipin] US Energy Informat Adm, 100 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA",Panteion University; Bournemouth University,"Filis, G (通讯作者)，Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece.;Filis, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022","Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973",,,,,187,129,136,5,146,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2018,39,5,,,,,85,130,,10.5547/01956574.39.5.sdeg,http://dx.doi.org/10.5547/01956574.39.5.sdeg,,,46,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GR6AF,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000442725200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the quantile-causality test shows that rare disaster-risks strongly affect both WTI returns and volatility, with stronger evidence of predictability observed at lower quantiles of the respective conditional distributions.

Consistent with the happiness results, we also find that relative to Catholics, Protestants and non-believers, those of Eastern Orthodox religion have less social capital and prefer old ideas and safe jobs. In addition, Orthodoxy is associated with left-leaning political preferences and stronger support for government involvement in the economy. Compared to non-believers and Orthodox adherents, Catholics and Protestants are less likely to agree that government ownership is a good thing, and Protestants are less likely to agree that getting rich can only happen at the expense of others. These differences in life satisfaction and other attitudes and values persisted despite the fact that communist elites sought to eradicate church-going in Eastern Europe, since communists maintained many aspects of Orthodox theology which were useful for the advancement of the communist doctrine. The findings are consistent with Berdyaev's (1933, 1937) hypothesis of communism as a successor of Orthodoxy.","[Djankov, Simeon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Djankov, Simeon] Peter G Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Nikolova, Elena] Cent European Labor Studies Inst, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Nikolova, Elena] Leibniz Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Regensburg, Germany; [Nikolova, Elena] UCL, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Peterson Institute for International Economics; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; University of London; University College London,"Djankov, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",S.Djankov@lse.ac.uk; e.nikolova@ucl.ac.uk,"Nikolova, Elena/HKN-1043-2023","Nikolova, Elena/0000-0002-6924-5415; Nikolova, Elena/0000-0001-9566-1167; Djankov, Simeon/0000-0002-0822-6456",UCL Centre for Comparative Studies of Emerging Economies,UCL Centre for Comparative Studies of Emerging Economies,"We would like to thank Sergei Guriev, Olena Nizalova, Marcus Noland, Jakub Polansky, Nicolas Veron, Andrei Shleifer, seminar participants at Leibniz IOS-Regensburg, anonymous referees, and participants at the conference People Matter: Quality of Life in Post Transition Economies for useful comments.

Indeed, it is argued that the so-called 'Smart Mobility' transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.","[Docherty, Iain] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Marsden, Greg; Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Glasgow; University of Leeds,"Docherty, I (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Iain.Docherty@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793; Docherty, Iain/0000-0002-4070-4294","RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award [EP/J00460X/1]; EPSRC [EP/J00460X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This paper is partly based on research undertaken as part of the Disruption: the raw material for low carbon change project, funded under the RCUK Energy Programme, ESPRC Award No. EP/J00460X/1.

Methods: A cross-sectional and longitudinal design was used to assess the PerfO measurement properties using the US Food and Drug Administration guidance for industry around patient-reported outcome measures to support labeling claims. Patient-reported outcome measures and patient- and clinician-reported global concept items were completed along with four PerfO measures at visit 1 and two follow-up visits. Measurement properties assessed included reliability, construct validity, ability to detect change, and estimates of meaningful change. Results: A total of 280 patients (100 eTHR, 105 eTKR, and 75 HF) were recruited, with most (n = 276) providing data at visit 1. Most of the patients were female (64%) and retired (64%), and had at least one comorbidity (91%). Inter-rater and test-retest reliability ranged from good to excellent (0.73 < intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.95) for each PerfO measure. Known-groups validity was demonstrated for all PerfO measures, with those reporting less pain better physical functioning and those who did not use an assistive device having quicker mean completion times. Construct validity and ability to detect change were demonstrated and estimates of meaningful change derived. Conclusions: This study found the measurement properties of four PerfO measures in samples of patients with eTHR, eTKR, and HF to be supported for consideration of future use, and provided estimates for interpretation of change.","[Doll, Helen; Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Gentile, Brittany] ICON Clin Res, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bush, Elizabeth Nicole] Eli Lilly & Co, Patient Focused Outcomes Ctr Expertise, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; Eli Lilly,"Ballinger, R (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res UK Ltd, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",rachel.ballinger@iconplc.com,,"Gentile, Brittany/0000-0002-6302-5593",Eli Lilly and Co.,Eli Lilly and Co.(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co.,,34,14,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21,9,,,,,1104,1114,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.006,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224116,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000444833500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alas, investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) does not take place in a vacuum. Such cases are decided by a tribunal typically consisting of three arbitrators, one each nominated by the two parties while the president is mutually agreed upon. We demonstrate that the kind of involvement of these arbitrators in previous ISDS cases matters for the case under dispute. Specifically, we show that what we label the presidents' pro-investor appointment biasthe number of times they have previously been nominated by an investor minus the number of times they have represented respondent statesraises the likelihood that an investor wins an ISDS case. The same holds for the pro-investor appointment bias of state-appointed arbitrators. Given the president's crucial role, the main implication of our findings is that presidents should be drawn from among those who have not systematically represented more one side than the other in previous cases.","[Donaubauer, Julian] Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Neumayer, Eric] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, London, England; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Donaubauer, J (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",julian.donaubauer@hsu-hh.de,"Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563",,,,,37,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Local commissioning bodies need to prioritise investments in health care, but previous studies provide limited evidence to inform the decision to expand existing services on the basis of cost-effectiveness. We examine the impact of specialist rehabilitation services in the subregion on hospital length of stay (LoS) and associated costs compared to routine care. Methods Comparison of hospital LoS and associated costs in centres with greater access (Hull) and limited access (i.e. routine care, York and Northern Lincolnshire), to specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disabilities following illness or injury, using Hospital Episodes Statistics data. Results Average LoS and duration costs by Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) were lower for the majority of patients with greater access to specialist rehabilitation compared to routine care. Difference in LoS between groups widened with level of complexity within each HRG. For the more frequent HRG codes, the LoS difference was as high as 34 days longer for York compared to Hull and pound 7900 more costly. Conclusion Rehabilitation patients within York and Northern Lincolnshire areas appear to have longer LoS and higher associated costs compared to those admitted to the Hull Trust. This analysis suggests that specialist rehabilitation may be cost saving compared to routine care and supports the case for expansion of the existing services to improve coverage in the area.","[Duarte, A.; Bojke, L.; Richardson, G.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bojke, C.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Fac Med & Hlth, Leeds LS2 9NL, W Yorkshire, England; [Cayton, W.; Salawu, A.] Hull & East Yorkshire Hosp NHS Trust, Kingston Upon Hull HU3 2JZ, N Humberside, England; [Salawu, A.] Hull York Med Sch, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Salawu, A.] Univ Hull, Dept Hlth Sports & Exercise Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Case, B.] NHS Vale York Clin Commissioning Grp, York YO1 6GA, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Leeds; University of York - UK; University of Hull; University of Hull,"Duarte, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ana.duarte@york.ac.uk,,"Salawu, Abayomi/0000-0003-2496-0826; Duarte, Ana/0000-0002-0528-4773; Bojke, Chris/0000-0003-2601-0314; Richardson, Gerald Anthony/0000-0002-2360-4566",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study has been partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber.

This paper presents the Compass4D project, which deployed a C-ITS system in seven European cities and coordinated the common evaluation of the technology for three services focusing specifically on safety and environmental objectives under real-world driving conditions. The significance of the Compass4D deployments and results provides some of the first evidence of the effectiveness of C-ITS in real world conditions. Both light and heavy vehicles showed efficiency savings of 2-6%. Equipped buses exhibited a variety of results with one pilot site showing a reduction of greater than 200gCO(2) per bus route per trip whilst other buses showed an increase in total emissions. The paper presents results from both field trials and microscopic simulation studies (to understand the network- or city-wide impacts of the technology). It discusses the results in detail before outlining the potential for further deployment in terms of the impact on energy efficiency and environmental objectives. Government and road operators will benefit from the results to gain an understanding of the potential impact of services given specific deployment characteristics.","[Edwards, S.; Hill, G.; Goodman, P.; Blythe, P.; Mitchell, P.; Huebner, Y.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Edwards, S (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",simon.edwards@ncl.ac.uk,,"Goodman, Paul/0000-0001-9952-3394; Blythe, Phil/0000-0003-2134-1253","European Commission under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme [CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.2, 325179]; EPSRC [EP/K037579/1, EP/K012398/1, EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Commission under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was funded by the European Commission under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP-ICT-PSP.2012.1.2, Grant agreement 325179).",,40,16,16,0,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The surplus process of the considered insurance entity is assumed to follow a Brownian motion with drift. The changes in the interest rate are described via a Markov-switching process. It turns out that in times with a positive rate, it is optimal to inject capital only if the company becomes insolvent. However, if the rate is negative it might be optimal to hold a strictly positive reserve. We establish an algorithm for finding the value function and the optimal strategy, which is proved to be of barrier type. Using the iteration argument, we show that the value function solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, corresponding to the problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we explain these results and conclude by extracting lessons from this analysis for creating wind power policy better aligned with developers' interests.","[Enevoldsen, Peter; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] BTECH Aarhus BSS Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Ctr Pk 15, Aarhus, Denmark; [Valentine, Scott Victor] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",National University of Singapore; University of Sussex,"Enevoldsen, P (通讯作者)，BTECH Aarhus BSS Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Ctr Pk 15, Aarhus, Denmark.",peterenevoldsen@btech.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Enevoldsen, Peter/0000-0001-6684-7747",,,,,31,28,29,0,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,1,7,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.022,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440123300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is put on the interaction between market power and investment incentives, and the trade-off it introduces when designing the optimal regulatory instruments. In contrast to the energy-only market paradigm that assumes perfect competition, our model demonstrates that in the presence of market power scarcity prices do not promote efficient investments, even among risk-neutral investors. Combining price caps and capacity payments allows to disentangle the two-fold objective of inducing the right investment incentives while mitigating market power. Bundling capacity payments with financial obligations further mitigates market power as long as strike prices are set sufficiently close to marginal costs.

We used three scenarios to estimate China's Peak uranium. And the results are quite robust. According to Scenario 3, the Hubbert Peak uranium production is expected to be reached in 2065 with 4605 t per year. Before the peak, China's uranium demand will grow at the rate of about 7.69% per year, which is about three times the growth rate of production. China's uranium import dependence is estimated to continue to increase. In order to improve uranium resources security, the Chinese government needs to increase investment in uranium ore exploration, encourage private sector's investment in uranium production to promote competition, and improve cooperation with non-uranium mining enterprises for more efficient use of resources. To enhance the country's uranium security, China should establish development funds, accelerate acquisition of uranium enterprises abroad, increase R&D in the unconventional uranium resources such as phosphate mine, and take advantage of price downturn in uranium market to increase strategic reserves.","[Fang, Jianchun] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Fang, Jianchun] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Lu, Zhou] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wanshan] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Huddersfield; Tianjin University of Commerce; Zhejiang University,"Wu, WS (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fangjch@cass.org.cn; c.lau@hud.ac.uk; luzhou59@gmail.com; wuwanshan@zju.edu.cn,"Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; fang, jianchun/0000-0003-0142-8730; Wu, Wanshan/0000-0002-2191-8713",National Social Science Fund of China [16BJY052],National Social Science Fund of China,"We thank anonymous reviewers, editors for their helpful comments and advice.

It may, for example, be desirable to stimulate passengers to switch from crowded buses and over to higher capacity rail. This requires a good understanding of drivers of transit modal substitution. The evidence put forward in this paper is based on more than 150 empirically estimated cross elasticities between PT modes from over 20 sources collected from Australia, Europe and USA. These sources include scientifically published evidence as well as grey literature. This evidence is coded into a database from which our paper presents and analyses the available cross-PT-modal demand relations. We focus on evidence for how fares, travel time and service intervals on PT 'mode A' affect the demand for PT 'mode B'. Despite generally low levels of substitution between PT modes, passengers are particularly sensitive to in vehicle, access/egress and waiting time in choosing PT mode and less so for fare variations. In general, rail demand is less sensitive to changes in bus than bus demand is to changes in rail. We also find that peak-hour demand more markedly switches between PT modes than off-peak demand does.","[Fearnley, Nils; Flugel, Stefan; Gregersen, Fredrik A.; Killi, Marit] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Currie, Graham] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Toner, Jeremy] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wardman, Mark] SYSTRA, Manchester, Lancs, England",Institute of Transport Economics; Monash University; University of Leeds,"Fearnley, N (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",naf@toi.no; graham.currie@monash.edu; sfl@toi.no; fag@toi.no; mki@toi.no; jtoner@its.leeds.ac.uk; mwardman@outlook.com,"Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020; Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Fearnley, Nils/AAE-7449-2020; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; Fearnley, Nils/0000-0001-5665-0246; Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829",Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project [246836],Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project,"The work leading to this paper work is financed by the Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project (grant number 246836).

We specify a Markov queuing model and use data collected from administrative records to estimate the link between two proxy indicators of across-sector complexity of discharge arrangements and post-operative length of stay in hospital for older people undergoing hip replacements. The results suggest that the number of local authorities involved in care planning and commissioning of social care services for discharges from a given hospital is significantly positively correlated with longer post-operative lengths of stay. A particularly strong effect is found between variability through time in the number of authorities involved in discharges from a given hospital and lengths of stay. The results suggest that improving information systems and joint assessment processes used during the discharge of patients with social care needs is likely to achieve significant efficiency gains in the health care system as a whole.

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations pass through to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013-15 appreciation was more muted. We also apply this framework to forecast the extent of pass-through from sterling's sharp depreciation corresponding to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We conceptualise this relationship by integrating insights from the management literature on innovation barriers with those derived from the international business and economic geography perspectives on the interplay of ownership and location advantages. By exploiting a firm-level panel dataset based on the UK Innovation Survey for the period 2002-2008, we test the relationship between perception of market risk and innovation behaviour in relation to firm ownership-i.e. multinational enterprises (MNEs) versus single domestic enterprises-and location-across regional contexts characterised by different degrees of technological dynamism. Our main results show that ownership advantages operate as a moderator by fundamentally affecting the direction of the relationship: while MNEs react positively to risk perception, single domestic firms reduce their innovation engagement as a strategy to cope with market uncertainty.

Using a sample of 60,058 observations-drawn from the European Central Bank-Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (ECB-SAFE)-related to small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) chartered in 11 Euro-area countries during the period 2009-2014, we first investigate whether female-led businesses are more likely, than male-led ones, to refrain from applying for bank credit. Finally, we assess whether corruption actually matters in the women's decision not to relying on the bank-lending channel. Our results-robust to various model specifications-highlight that women-led SMEs face a higher probability to self-refrain from applying for loans vis-a-vis their male counterparts. In addition, although corruption appears strongly correlated to the self-restraint attitudes of firms, our empirical analysis reveals that women-led SMEs generally tend to refrain from applying for loans, more than men, regardless of the quality of the surrounding environment.","[Galli, Emma] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci DiSSE, Rome, Italy; [Mascia, Danilo Valerio] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Nottingham, England; [Rossi, Stefania Patrizia Sonia] Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Business Math & Stat DEAMS, Trieste, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Nottingham; University of Trieste,"Galli, E (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci DiSSE, Rome, Italy.",emma.galli@uniroma1.it; danilo.mascia@gmail.com; stefania.rossi@deams.units.it,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Mascia, Danilo V./0000-0002-3776-0420","Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Legge Regionale 2007 [CRP-59890]","Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Legge Regionale 2007","The authors thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their useful and constructive comments.

However, the employment and output impact of government contracts remains controversial. We use georeferenced data on United States (US) federal contracts, distinguishing between the location of the recipient and the location of the activity, for the years 2005-2014 in order to assess the employment and output impacts of federal contracting in metropolitan areas of the US. We resort to a shift-share instrument and precise location-specific fixed effects to estimate the causal impact of spending. Cities that receive more contract expenditure witness an expansion in output - with contracts generating $1.4 per dollar spent - but experience only modest increases in employment. The impact is also constrained geographically and short-lived. The results suggest that, on average, the effects of federal contracting on local economies are modest, meaning that attracting federal contracts may not be an effective urban development strategy.","[Gerritse, Michiel] Erasmus Univ, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",gerritse@ese.eur.nl; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,23,6,7,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

It implies mobile storages that could - during long phases of immobility - provide services for the electricity sector. However, this technical option - called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) - requires the vehicle users to temporarily abstain from the usage of their batteries for V2G. A reasonable estimate of the potential of V2G thus considers which individual, technical and economic parameters are decisive for the willingness of vehicle users to participate. To answer these questions a representative sample of vehicle users in Germany has been surveyed - including a discrete choice experiment. 'Range anxiety' and the 'minimum range' proved most important determinants of the willingness of vehicle users to participate in V2G. If these concerns are smoothed out, even without remuneration, high participation rates might be achieved. To increase the participation in the V2G technology, the transition from 'tank control' to 'mobility demand articulation' should be facilitated for vehicle users. Therefore, companies could tailor the V2G design to customers' needs and policy could improve information about V2G. Remuneration, however, cannot be expected to be very supportive.","[Geske, Joachim] Imperial Coll London, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Schumann, Diana] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Syst Anal & Technol Evaluat IEK STE, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Imperial College London; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Geske, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, London SW7 2AZ, England.",j.geske@imperial.ac.uk,,"Schumann, Diana/0000-0002-5533-4871","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWI) [FKZ 03ET4005]","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWI)","This research is part of the project 'grid integration of mobile energy storage: test based evaluation, technical potentials and willingness of vehicle user (NET-INES)'.

Using bounding scenarios of attributional lifecycle analysis, this study finds that the climate impacts of United States exports to China, Japan, India, or South Korea could vary significantly, with annual global lifecycle emissions ranging from -88,000 metric tons CO(2)e to + 170,000 metric tons CO(2)e per Bcf of exports. Exact emissions will depend on factors such as (a) the final end-use of the LNG, (b) domestic market impacts from increased natural gas prices in the United States, (c) induced additional energy consumption in importing countries, and (d) methane leakage rates. Country specific greenhouse gas outcomes can differ from global outcomes, with major implications for extraction and consumption based emissions accounting. The study's results indicate the need for more robust consideration of the climate impacts of all energy exports in terms of country specific energy analyses, global climate regulations, and market uncertainty. Thus, how gas is governed becomes of critical importance, for it will determine whether LNG is a net sink or source of additional emissions.","[Gilbert, Alexander Q.] Spark Lib, Washington, DC USA; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aarhus University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",alexgilbert@sparklibrary.com; BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Gilbert, Alexander/0000-0001-7906-6106",,,,,43,10,11,2,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,635,643,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440123300059,View Full Record in Web of Science

The New Development Bank can provide an effective intervention mechanism for the BRIGS in Africa. New BRICS' policy initiatives suggest a more accelerated approach on renewable energy investment and technological cooperation. However, for the foreseeable future, individual members will be the drivers of the transfer process, particularly China and India. In terms of policy, the BRICS need to elaborate a specific strategy for renewable energy cooperation for both intra-BRICS and extra-BRICE development.

In this regard, we, first, estimate a dynamic factor model with time-varying loadings and stochastic volatility (DFM-TV-SV). Then, in the second step, we use a quantile-on-quantile (QQ) predictive regression model to capture the effect of EPU on the common factor and stochastic volatility derived from the DFM-TV-SV for the states and MSAs. Our results show that EPU has a significant negative effect on the common economic activity of both the states and MASs, and it also significantly increases the common volatility. However, the impact of uncertainty varies substantially depending on the initial states (quantiles) of both common output or volatility and EPU.

J,"Guriev, S; Melnikov, N",,,,"Guriev, Sergei; Melnikov, Nikita",,,Happiness convergence in transition countries,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LIFE; GAP,"The transition happiness gap has been one of the most robust findings in the literature on life satisfaction. Until very recently, scholars using various datasets have shown that residents of post-communist countries were significantly less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts in non-transition countries (controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics). The literature has explained this finding by the great macroeconomic instability of the 1990s, by a substantial decrease in the quality and accessibility of public goods, by the major increase in inequality, and by the rapid depreciation of pre-transition human capital. All these factors were expected to subside over time at least after the post-Great-Recession recovery. In this paper, we consider two most recent datasets the third wave of the Life in Transition Survey (administered in 2015-16) and the 2010-2016 waves of the annual Gallup World Poll. We find that by 2016 the transition happiness gap had closed. This convergence has taken place both due to a happiness recovery in post-communist countries after the Great Recession and due to a decrease in life satisfaction in comparator countries in recent years. We also find that the convergence in life satisfaction was primarily driven by middle-income young, educated individuals, regardless of gender.","[Guriev, Sergei] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Guriev, Sergei] CEPR, London, England; [Melnikov, Nikita] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",sergei.guriev@sciencespo.fr,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169; Melnikov, Nikita/0000-0003-0702-3443",,,,,12,20,21,0,17,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Yet, in the EU, the energy- and emissions-saving potentials of this strategy continue to be framed as secondary outcomes of resource-related policies. Understanding why material efficiency has been overlooked as an energy/climate solution is a prerequisite for proposing ways of changing its framing, but existing studies have failed to do so. This paper fills this gap by triangulating interviews, policy documents and three policy theories: namely, historical and rational choice institutionalism, and multiple streams framework. Factors discouraging material efficiency as an energy and climate strategy include: difficulties in reframing the prevailing rationale to pursue it; the inadequacy of monitored indicators; the lack of high-level political buy-in from DG Energy and Clima; the ETS policy lock-in; uncoordinated policy management across Directorates; the lack of a designated industry lobby. Policy solutions are proposed. Before 2030, these are limited to minor amendments, e.g. guidance on embodied energy calculations or industry standards. Post-2030, more radical interventions are possible, such as introducing new fiscal drivers, re-designing the ETS emissions cap or benchmarks for allowances. This evidence suggests that the transition to a low-carbon industry will require Member State- and industry-level action.","[Hernandez, Ana Gonzalez; Skelton, Alexandra C.

But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how - if at all - the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador's national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers' engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito's local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these priority goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation.

Our results suggest that diet measured as calories, fat, protein, and diversity of food consumption has a statistically significant effect on life satisfaction levels of the Russian population. In addition, living in a region with higher per capita income increases population's life satisfaction. While living in a rural area, having health problems, and having young children affect individual life satisfaction in Russia in a negative and statistically significantly way. Life satisfaction is also positively correlated with education and income, and negatively with unemployment.

Theoretically, we exploit a structural gravity model to derive a closed-form solution for a widely-used measure of market potential. We are thus able to express market potential as a function of directly observable and easily estimated variables. Empirically, we collect a large dataset on aggregate and bilateral trade flows as well as output for 51 countries. We find that market potential exhibits an upward trend across all regions of the world from the early 1930s and that this trend significantly deviates from the evolution of world GDP. Finally, using exogenous variation in trade-related distances to world markets, we demonstrate a significant causal role of market potential in driving global income growth over this period.

Can such frameworks deliver maximal investment when agents are motivated by reciprocity? We demonstrate that indeed they can, but not how one might expect. If maximal investment is impossible in the absence of the institution and public good returns are high, then an agreement signed by all parties cannot lead to full investment. However, if all parties reject the agreement, then full investment is attainable via a gentlemen's agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU). Agreement institutions may thus do more than just facilitate the signing of binding agreements; they may play a critical role in igniting informal cooperation underpinned by reciprocity.

In such models, groups with different compositions of individuals generally co-exist and the reproductive success (fitness) of a specific strategy varies with the frequencies of different group types. These frequencies crucially depend on the matching process. For arbitrary matching processes (called matching rules), we study Nash equilibrium and ESS in the associated population game and show that several results that are known to hold for population games under uniform random matching carry through to our setting. In our most novel contribution, we derive results on the efficiency of the Nash equilibria of population games and show that for any (fixed) payoff structure, there always exists some matching rule leading to average fitnessmaximization. Finally, we provide a series of applications to commonly studied normal-form games.","[Jensen, Martin Kaae] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Rigos, Alexandros] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",University of Surrey; Lund University,"Jensen, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford, Surrey, England.",m.k.jensen@surrey.ac.uk,,"Rigos, Alexandros/0000-0003-3787-5030",,,,,49,10,13,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Unit root tests are applied to examine the time-series properties of the variables, while the Johansen cointegration test is performed to confirm or not the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables. Moreover, the multivariate Granger causality test and a modified version of Wald test are applied to examine the direction of the short-run and long-run causality respectively. The cointegration analysis reveals that manufactured exports contribute more to economic growth than primary exports in the long-run. In addition, this research provides evidence to support a bi-directional causality between manufactured exports and economic growth in the short-run, while the Growth-Led Exports (GLE) hypothesis is valid in the long-run for UAE.","[Kalaitzi, Athanasia S.; Cleeve, Emmanuel] Manchester Metropolitan Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University,"Kalaitzi, AS (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",kalaitzi.athanasia@gmail.com; e.cleeve@mmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,25,29,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

It combines semi-structured interviews with foreign exchange market participants in Brazil and London and advanced time-series econometrics. In line with Post Keynesian theory and critical realist ontology, the interviews uncover the context-specific expectations and underlying processes and structures that condition exchange rate dynamics in Brazil and emerging economies more generally. The results point to important structural changes in Brazil's financial integration in the form of currency internationalisation and financialisation. Moreover, they show that this internationalisation has been mediated through a structured and hierarchic international monetary system which fundamentally distinguishes exchange rate drivers in emerging economies from those in developed ones.","[Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Econ Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Kaltenbrunner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Econ Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",A.Kaltenbrunner@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,13,14,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using alternative estimators for efficiency, our results show that Takaful operators are inefficient suggesting the presence of widespread managerial lethargy and operational inefficiency. Additional analyses indicate that non-executive directors, audit committees, and product diversification do not improve technical efficiency. Rather, audit committees and regulatory jurisdiction tends to reduce scale efficiency. We also find that CEO/chair duality, board size, organizational age, regulatory jurisdiction and firm size have a positive relationship with technical efficiency. We further report that non-executive directors, Shari'ah board, product diversification and institutional ownership improve scale efficiency. In particular, the study provides new and extended regional evidence on the efficiency of the Takaful industry in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) and the Southeast East Asian (ASEAN) region.

Poor small-scale farmers in this region are particularly vulnerable to this variability. As a result, households may be reluctant to adopt new agricultural water management (AWM) technologies when they involve more risk than what they mitigate. Despite risk's role in AWM investments, there have been few attempts to estimate the magnitude and nature of risk aversion in relation to this type of farm decisions. To partially close this gap, this article uses an experimental approach applied to 137 households in Northern Ghana. We find that more than 70% of households are moderately or slightly risk averse. This contrasts with other studies in SSA, where most household decision-makers exhibit severe to extreme risk aversion. We also find that households that stand to lose as well as gain something from participation in games are less risk averse than households playing gains-only games. This result suggests that most farmers' current wealth put them at risk of falling into a poverty trap. Thus, the losses from the riskiest investments on AWM technologies may fall more heavily on the poor, suggesting that additional efforts be given to the creation of viable insurance mechanisms.","[Katic, Pamela] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Ellis, Tim] Environm Southland, Invercargill, New Zealand",University of Greenwich,"Katic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England.",p.g.katic@gre.ac.uk,,,USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme,USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),We wish to acknowledge the USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme for funding this study.

Here, we present a novel comprehensive bottom-up process chain framework that is applied to 19 electricity generation technologies, consistently incorporating 12 life-cycle phases from extraction to decommissioning. For each life-cycle phase of each technology the following 4 key metrics were assessed: material consumption, energy return ratios, job requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. We also calculate a novel global electricity to grid average for these metrics and present a metric variability analysis by altering transport distance, load factors, efficiency, and fuel density per technology. This work quantitatively supports model-to-policy frameworks that drive technology selection and investment based on energetic-economic viability, job creation and carbon emission reduction of technologies. The results suggest energetic-economic infeasibility of electricity generation networks with substantial shares of: i) liquefied natural gas transport, ii) long distance transport based hard and brown coal and pipeline natural gas, and iii) low-load factor solar-photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind. Direct sector jobs can be expected to double in renewable-majority scenarios. All combustion-powered technologies without natural (bio-mass) or artificial carbon capture (fossil fuels) are not compatible with a low carbon electricity generation future.","[Kis, Zoltan; Pandya, Nikul] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, Fac Engn, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Koppelaar, Rembrandt H.

This paper searches for empirical evidence to support this formulation. We show that travellers who indicate that a shorter trip duration is useful or a longer trip duration is very inconvenient have a higher value of travel time. Furthermore, we show that people who can spend their travel time usefully have a lower value of travel time. Finally, the availability of a computer, laptop etc. during the trip increases the probability of travel time being useful. This study determines the sizes of these effects in a case study for The Netherlands. This is important since the value of travel time is likely to change over time. The outcomes of this paper can be used to estimate the size of the expected reduction in value of travel time as a result of future comfort improvements that increase the possibility to work, read a book, watch a movie and communicate during a trip.","[Kouwenhoven, Marco; de Jong, Gerard] Significance, The Hague, Netherlands; [Kouwenhoven, Marco] Delft Univ Technol, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands; [de Jong, Gerard] Univ Leeds, ITS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Delft University of Technology; University of Leeds,"Kouwenhoven, M (通讯作者)，Significance, The Hague, Netherlands.",kouwenhoven@significance.nl,,,KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment,KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment,This work was funded by the KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.,,30,32,37,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Furthermore, with non-synchronous trading and contamination of microstructure noise, we propose a nonparametrically eigenvalue-regularized integrated covariance matrix estimator (NERIVE) which does not assume specific structures for the underlying integrated covariance matrix. We show that NERIVE is positive definite in probability, with extreme eigenvalues shrunk nonlinearly under the high dimensional framework p/n -> c > 0. We also prove that in portfolio allocation, the minimum variance optimal weight vector constructed using NERIVE has maximum exposure and actual risk upper bounds of order P-1/2. Incidentally, the same maximum exposure bound is also satisfied by the theoretical minimum variance portfolio weights. All these results hold true also under a jump-diffusion model for the log-price processes with jumps removed using the wavelet method proposed in Fan and Wang (2007). They are further extended to accommodate the existence of pervasive factors such as a market factor under the setting p(3/2)/n -> c > 0. The practical performance of NERIVE is illustrated by comparing to the usual two-scale realized covariance matrix as well as some other nonparametric alternatives using different simulation settings and a real data set.

We found that consumption-based CO2 emissions were more than 30% higher than production-based emissions in Shanghai. In recent years, both production- and consumption-based CO2 emissions in Shanghai declined because of changes in China's economic development mode. The production-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in the production structure and energy mix, while the consumption-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in consumption patterns and domestic interregional emission flows.

The approach provides a detailed investigation of the consequences on economic growth following changes in countries' supply chains. We apply the method to data from Brazil and other countries. The results suggest that the substitution of imported for national inputs is a key factor in SDA, assuming that the impact of technological change is underestimated if this substitution is not taken into account. The findings also show that the substitution of imported inputs is essential to understanding the Brazilian growth path in the 2000s. The positive impact of export growth on total output was offset by the increase in imported inputs, especially in highly technological sectors. The results in Brazil stand in contrast with those in Korea, China, and Germany, where high-tech sectors benefited the most from the substitution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It suggests these differences can be viewed as an expression of cultural habits. We explore different ways of defining exposure to the communist regime: using number of years a person spent under the regime and also a dummy indicator for spending formative years (18-25) in it. We find both to be strong factors in explaining alcohol consumption behaviour. We consider differences in frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking using European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) micro data from Eurostat. Estimations are run with ordered probit model for men and women separately. Evidence suggests a statistically significant effect of experiencing communist regimes, which is larger for women's alcohol consumption frequency than for men's. It is also the most important factor in explaining more frequent male binge drinking. These effects hold after controlling for socio-economic, country level and time characteristics. This suggests the attitudes towards alcohol consumption could be more permissive in the Eastern Bloc countries.","[Malisauskaite, Gintare; Klein, Alexander] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Malisauskaite, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England.",G.Malisauskaite@kent.ac.uk,"Klein, Alexander/KBQ-6003-2024","Malisauskaite, Gintare/0000-0002-0797-5949",,,,,21,5,5,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

We distinguish close social networks (composed of friends and family) abroad and at the current location, and broad social networks (composed of same-country residents with intention to migrate, either internationally or locally). We find that social networks abroad are the most important driving forces of international migration intentions, with close and broad networks jointly explaining about 37% of variation in the probability intentions. Social networks are found to be more important factors driving migration intentions than work-related aspects or wealth (wealth accounts for less than 3% of the variation). In addition, we find that having stronger close social networks at home has the opposite effect by reducing the likelihood of migration intentions, both internationally and locally.

Early stages of new international conservation and development programs, often involving pilot projects designed to test intervention concepts at village level, are characterized by large amounts of resources and attention, along with high expectations of success. However, evidence shows that these early expectations are rarely fulfilled. Despite this repeated pattern and growing engagement with expectations in critical conservation and development literature, little is known about the dynamics of expectations in conservation and development pilot projects. We address this knowledge gap first by exploring concepts from the sociology of expectations. We then unpack expectations in a case study of REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, using extensive qualitative data reflecting the perspectives and experiences of a wide range of actors involved. Our study finds that expectations play a performative role, mobilizing actors and resources, despite uncertainty identified among policy-makers and practitioners. We also find that once raised, expectations are dynamic and continually mediated by actors and social contexts, which conflicts with attempts to 'manage' them. We argue therefore that a trade-off exists between fully piloting new initiatives and raising expectations. We also argue that failure to address this trade-off has implications beyond pilot project objectives and timelines, which are experienced most acutely by village communities. We argue for more critical engagement with expectations and the embedding of accountability for expectations in conservation and development practice. Our findings also challenge the discourse of 'needing' to pilot, which prioritizes awareness, impact and innovation without fully considering the potential negative impact of unfulfilled expectations.

It looks at the positions taken by the periodical over the years and asks, What kind of print object was it? It places the publication within a twentieth century history of left political economy periodicals and compares it with its closest contemporaries in the cultures of print of the American Left, notably Monthly Review and Radical America. The attention to the print ventures of radical economics in the 1970s is a contribution to a new kind of historiography that takes an expanded and extra-curricular outlook of economics.","[Mata, Tiago] UCL, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Mata, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",t.mata@ucl.ac.uk,"Mata, Tiago/A-3850-2010","Mata, Tiago/0000-0002-6423-299X",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [283754]; European Research Council (ERC) [283754] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author acknowledges and thanks financial support of the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), grant agreement n degrees 283754, Economics in the Public Sphere.",,47,6,6,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Here, we ask: what is equitable resilience? Our focus is on what resilience does on the ground in relation to development, adaptation and disaster management, and on identifying critical issues for engaging with equity in resilience practice. Using techniques from systematic reviews, with variants of equitable resilience as our key search terms, we carried out an analytical literature review which reveals four interconnected themes: subjectivities, inclusion, cross-scale interactions, and transformation. Drawing on this analysis, we find that 'equitable resilience' is increasingly likely when resilience practice takes into account issues of social vulnerability and differential access to power, knowledge, and resources; it requires starting from people's own perception of their position within their human environmental system, and it accounts for their realities and for their need for a change of circumstance to avoid imbalances of power into the future. Our approach moves beyond debates that focus on the ontological disconnect between resilience and social theory, to provide a definition that can be used in practice alongside resilience indicators to drive ground level interventions towards equitable outcomes. Defined in this way, equitable resilience is able to support the development of social-ecological systems that are contextually rooted, responsive to change and socially just, and thus relevant to global sustain ability challenges.

This paper attempts to answer that question by examining how government systems influence macroeconomic performance. We find that presidential regimes consistently are associated with less favorable outcomes than parliamentary regimes: slower output growth, higher and more volatile inflation and greater income inequality. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is sizable. For example, annual output growth is between 0.6 and 1.2 percentage points lower and inflation is estimated to be at least four percentage points higher under presidential regimes relative to those under parliamentary ones. The difference in distributional outcomes is even starker; income inequality is 12 to 24% worse under presidential systems.","[McManus, Richard] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Christ Church Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ozkan, F.

This has been particularly marked in Britain, often in historic cities (such as York, Oxford and Cambridge). Development of busways has also provided opportunities for complementary P&R development. Nonetheless, a net increase in passenger car unit (pcu)-kilometres may be observed, despite a reduction on the principal radial corridor. This is due to increased car-kilometres in catchment areas of P&R sites, but this simple additive approach to changes in pcu-km may not reflect overall impacts if pcu-km are removed from a congested urban corridor. By using monetised external cost per pcu-km for different road types and traffic conditions (such as those in 'WebTAG' guidance in Britain), the net effect can be expressed in economic terms. Presented here is a case study of the Chelmsford system, showing that a net economic benefit may be attained, even though a net increase in pcu-km has occurred.

This paper presents an integrated electricity expansion model (IEEM) for South Africa that seeks to incorporate demand side management (DSM) in providing a roadmap for improving and increasing energy (electricity) access that is sustainable, viable, ethically compliant and cost effective. In modelling IEEM, a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) would be utilized in simulating the dispatch of DSM loads (residential houses only) across the country. This paper advances traditional grid expansion planning by presenting smart policy discussions on the usefulness of IEEM in reducing associated network losses, enhancing utilization of local energy sources and minimizing expansion and plant operations costs. This paper also discusses the impact of the IEEM on the quality of life (QoL) of households and quality of service (QoS) of the utility.

Employing a Time-Varying Vector Auto-regressive framework on monthly data from January 1990 to June 2015 in which the sources of time variation were both the coefficients and variance-covariance matrix of the innovations, this study found that historically oil price shocks have negatively affected the stock market, however the energy sector stock has always responded positively holding their title as hedge against oil shocks. It was also found that the shift from net oil exporter to net oil importer did not influence the association between the UK, stock market and oil shocks much. Including the discrete break and subsampling of series led to controlling for the prior beliefs and agent's behaviour in the Pre-GFC period. It turned out that the GFC had been a game changer and the stock market as well as the energy sector showed a positive and symmetric response to oil shocks. These findings have profound implications in terms of depressed global aggregate demand and oil shocks dynamics in the Post-GFC world.","[Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Rizvi, Sabin Abass] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Rossi, Matted] Univ Sannio, Dept Econ, Benevento, Italy",Leeds Beckett University; University of Sannio,"Nasir, MA (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Rossi, Matteo/AAC-3929-2019; Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019","Rossi, Matteo/0000-0002-3669-7976; Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854",,,,,109,34,34,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The Global Apollo Programme called for collective action to develop renewable energy. This paper sets out a method for assessing whether a trajectory of investment that involves initial subsidies is justified by the subsequent learning-by-doing spillovers and if so, computes the maximum justifiable additional subsidy to provide, taking account of the special features of renewable electricity - geographically dispersed and variable quality resource base and local saturation. Given current costs and learning rates, accelerating the current rate of investment appears globally socially beneficial for solar PV in most but not all cases, less so for on-shore wind.

We test whether past unemployment experience can explain this transition happiness gap in the context of Ukraine, a country with a painful delayed transition from planned to market economy. We analyze unique longitudinal data for the period 2003-2012. Current unemployment substantially reduces subjective wellbeing, and the effect is roughly 50% larger for men than for women. The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment.

The commodity composition of the two trade collapses was quite similar, but the latter collapse was much sharper due to the spread of manufacturing across the globe during the intervening period. The increasing importance of manufacturing also meant that the trade collapse was more geographically balanced in the later episode. Protectionism was much more severe during the 1930s than after 2008, and in the UK case at least helped to skew the direction of trade away from multilateralism and towards Empire. This had dangerous political consequences.","[O'Rourke, Kevin Hjortshoj] All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England",University of Oxford,"O'Rourke, KH (通讯作者)，All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England.",kevin.orourke@all-souls.ox.ac.uk,"O'Rourke, Kevin/B-5927-2008","O'Rourke, Kevin/0000-0001-6272-2090",European Research Council under the European Union [249546]; European Research Council (ERC) [249546] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Revised version of a paper prepared for IMF-BNM-IMFER Conference on Globalization in the Aftermath of the Crisis and the IMF Economic Review.

This class generalizes the strategies studied by Mobius () in the context of a favor-exchange model and the strategies studied in our companion paper, Olszewski and Safronov (). In two-player games, if players have private values and their types evolve according to independent Markov chains, then under very mild conditions on the stage game, the efficient outcome can be approximated by chip-strategy equilibria when the discount factor tends to 1. We extend this result (assuming stronger conditions) to stage games with any number of players.

Intuitively, in these equilibria, players exchange favors by taking individually suboptimal actions if these actions create a gain for the opponent larger than the player's loss from taking them. In exchange, the player who provides a favor implicitly obtains from the opponent a chip that entitles the player to receiving a favor at some future date. Players are initially endowed with a number of chips, and a player who runs out of chips is no longer entitled to receive any favors until she provides a favor to the opponent, in which case she receives one chip back. We show that such simple chip strategies approximate efficient outcomes in a class of repeated symmetric games with incomplete information, in which each player has two possible types, when discounting vanishes. This class includes many important applications, studied in numerous previous papers, such as the favor-exchange model of Mobius (), repeated auctions, and the repeated version of Spulber duopolies of Athey and Bagwell (), among others. We also show the limitation of chip strategies. For example, if players have more than two types, then such simple chip strategies may not approximate efficient outcomes even in symmetric games.","[Olszewski, Wojciech] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Safronov, Mikhail] Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge, England",Northwestern University; University of Cambridge,"Olszewski, W (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",wo@northwestern.edu; mikhailsafronov2014@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,28,3,6,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The Ramsey rule can be extended to regime-dependent interest-rate formulas for discounting future regime changes. Notwithstanding debate about empirically plausible values of the rate of pure time preference, I theoretically show that the effect of pure time preference is overwhelmingly dominated by the effect of the regime switching parameter.

Discrete event simulations (DESs) have been proposed as a superior approach. Objective We developed a state-transition model and a DES using the discretely integrated condition event (DICE) framework and compared the cost-effectiveness results. We performed scenario analysis using the DES to explore the impact of alternative assumptions. Methods The models estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the intervention and comparator from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. The models considered five comorbidities: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. The state-transition model used prevalence data, and the DES used incidence. The costs and utility inputs were the same between two models and consistent with those used in previous analyses for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Results In the state-transition model, the intervention produced an additional 0.16 QALYs at a cost of 540 pound, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3438 pound. The comparable DES scenario produced an ICER of 5577 pound. The ICER for the DES increased to 18,354 pound when long-term relapse was included. Conclusions The model structures themselves did not influence smoking cessation cost-effectiveness results, but long-term assumptions did. When there is variation in long-term predictions between interventions, economic models need a structure that can reflect this.","[Pennington, Becky] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Pennington, Becky; Owen, Lesley] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, 10 Spring Gardens, London SW1A 2BU, England; [Filby, Alex; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of York - UK,"Pennington, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.;Pennington, B (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, 10 Spring Gardens, London SW1A 2BU, England.",b.pennington@sheffield.ac.uk,"Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","Pennington, Becky/0000-0002-1002-022X",NICE,NICE,"When this work was undertaken, Becky Pennington and Lesley Owen were employed by the NICE.

Beyond the context of economic evaluation, evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health state utility values can be used to inform broader health policy decisions. This paper provides practical guidance on how to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of health state utility values. The paper outlines a number of stages in conducting a systematic review, including identifying the appropriate evidence, study selection, data extraction and presentation, and quality and relevance assessment. The paper outlines three broad approaches that can be used to synthesise multiple estimates of health utilities for a given health state or condition, namely fixed-effect meta-analysis, random-effects meta-analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression. Each approach is illustrated by a synthesis of utility values for a hypothetical decision problem, and software code is provided. The paper highlights a number of methodological issues pertinent to the conduct of meta-analysis or meta-regression. These include the importance of limiting synthesis to 'comparable' utility estimates, for example those derived using common utility measurement approaches and sources of valuation; the effects of reliance on limited or poorly reported published data from primary utility assessment studies; the use of aggregate outcomes within analyses; approaches to generating measures of uncertainty; handling of median utility values; challenges surrounding the disentanglement of utility estimates collected serially within the context of prospective observational studies or prospective randomised trials; challenges surrounding the disentanglement of intervention effects; and approaches to measuring model validity. Areas of methodological debate and avenues for future research are highlighted.","[Petrou, Stavros; Madan, Jason] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Kwon, Joseph] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Warwick; University of Sheffield,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Kwon, Joseph/0000-0002-2860-7280; Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480","MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,69,22,22,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36,9,,,,,1043,1061,,10.1007/s40273-018-0670-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0670-1,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29750430,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000439998500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we draw upon interviews to interpret site selection consultants as intermediaries between a demand for locations emanating from MNEs and a supply of locations provided by national and subnational territories. We show how this intermediary role extends beyond the economizing on search costs and into the rarely appreciated market-creating and value adding opportunities offered by location. We also show how the knowledge mobilised by consultants is quintessentially geographical. Paradoxically, it is the geographical nature of the knowledge mobilised by site selection consultants that presents frictions to the professionalisation and globalisation of the industry despite its seminal role in promoting the mobility of economic activities. In conclusion, we explore elements of a future research agenda centred on the mediated nature of MNE location decisions.","[Phelps, Nicholas A.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Wood, Andrew M.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, 857 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of London; University College London; University of Kentucky,"Phelps, NA (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",n.phelps@ucl.ac.uk,,"Wood, Andrew/0000-0001-5931-2621","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","The authors are grateful for research funding for this research provided by the Bartlett School of Planning, University College London and the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky.",,68,19,20,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Several studies have noted that there are methodological challenges to conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. Objective: Our objective was to examine key methodological challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests, prioritize these challenges for future research, and identify how studies have attempted solutions to address these challenges. Methods: We identified challenges for economic evaluations of NGS tests using prior literature and expert judgment of the co-authors. We used a modified Delphi assessment to prioritize challenges, based on importance and probability of resolution. Using a structured literature review and article extraction we then assessed whether published economic evaluations had addressed these challenges. Results: We identified 11 challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. The experts identified three challenges as the top priorities for future research: complex model structure, timeframe, and type of analysis and comparators used. Of the 15 published studies included in our literature review, four studies described specific solutions relevant to five of the 11 identified challenges. Conclusions: Major methodological challenges to economic evaluations of NGS tests remain to be addressed. Our results can be used to guide future research and inform decision-makers on how to prioritize research on the economic assessment of NGS tests.","[Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med TRANSP, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Deverka, Patricia A.] Amer Inst Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Wordsworth, Sarah; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Med Sci Div, Oxford, England; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Canc Control BC, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Christensen, Kurt D.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; American Institutes for Research; University of Calgary; University of Oxford; University of British Columbia; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Phillips, KA (通讯作者)，Dept Clin Pharm, 3333 Calif St,Room 420,POB 0613, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kathryn.Phillips@ucsf.edu,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040",National Human Genome Research Institute [R01 HG007063],National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)),This study was funded by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (R01 HG007063) and consulting agreement with Illumina (no number).,,32,50,53,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21,9,,,,,1033,1042,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.017,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224106,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000444833500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To this end, a comprehensive database of commercial Light Water Reactors (LWR) was developed and a statistical analysis was conducted. Findings reveal a significant delay in lead-time, especially for the last generation reactors constructed from 2010s, with 3/4 of the sample showing significant construction delays. This results in an escalation of capital costs rather than in a decline. Average OCC of newer reactors is 60% higher than the ones implemented in the earlier stages of the nuclear era. This suggests a discontinuity of the learning curve for both OCC and lead-time, which threats the market and financial sustainability of current and future nuclear energy projects. Although this is a general trend, this discontinuity is country specific and, thus, induced by national policies and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, the role of nuclear technology as an alternative to cope with the need for a decarbonisation of the power sector must be better evaluated, taking into account the real cost impacts of nuclear technology implementation.","[Portugal-Pereira, J.; Szklo, A.; Schaeffer, R.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Tecnol, Energy Planning Program, Grad Sch Engn, Bloco C,Sala 211,Cidade Univ, BR-21941972 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Portugal-Pereira, J.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Weeks Bldg 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1BA, England; [Ferreira, P.; Cunha, J.; Araujo, M.] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Ctr, Sch Engn, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Imperial College London; Universidade do Minho,"Portugal-Pereira, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Weeks Bldg 16-18 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1BA, England.",j.portugal@imperial.ac.uk,"Pereira, Joana/IQT-1620-2023; Portugal-Pereira, Joana/ABF-1654-2020; Schaeffer, Roberto/AAY-4357-2020; Ferreira, Paula/H-8646-2012; Araujo, Madalena T/I-2673-2013; Szklo, Alexandre/AAP-8970-2021; Szklo, Alexandre/C-3315-2013; Schaeffer, Roberto/F-9262-2012; Cunha, Jorge/M-6099-2013","Portugal-Pereira, Joana/0000-0003-1260-6950; Ferreira, Paula/0000-0002-3712-4803; Araujo, Madalena T/0000-0002-3515-0135; Szklo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7101-1810; Schaeffer, Roberto/0000-0002-3709-7323; Cunha, Jorge/0000-0002-6267-708X","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq) [166074/2015-2]; Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning [PIRSES-GA-2013-612263]","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning(European Union (EU))","This work was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development agency (CNPq) (166074/2015-2) and the Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship within the 7th European Union Framework Programme, under the project NETEP- European Brazilian Network on Energy Planning (PIRSES-GA-2013-612263).

The developments have been reported at past Thredbo Conferences, including by the author in 2007 and 2015. The franchising regime has been remarkably resilient and has been through at least five phases. Using the concept of regulatory cycles, this paper reviews the prospects for a sixth and possibly final phase. Rail statistics are reviewed and a welfare analysis of rail reforms in Britain is undertaken, building on and updating work presented in 2011. This suggests that franchising has been modestly welfare enhancing over the substantive phases of franchising to date, even though the transaction costs associated with franchising are substantial and apparently increasing. However, there remain concerns. Train operating costs remain high. There are also concerns about the costs that the vertical separation of operations and infrastructure impose on the system and there are plans for experiments with forms of integration. The competitive picture is evolving, in part in response to the commissioning of High Speed 2 and the Competition and Markets Authority's recommendations. Given this backdrop, this paper will consider some of the pros and cons of further changes to the franchising regime.","[Preston, John] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Transportat Grp, Room 4003,Bldg 176,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO16 7QF, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Preston, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Transportat Grp, Room 4003,Bldg 176,Burgess Rd, Southampton SO16 7QF, Hants, England.",jpreston@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This continuing disagreement can be explained in significant part by problems associated with low-quality government revenue data: it has undermined the robustness of many existing findings, while leading other researchers to rely on alternative measures of resource income as their primary explanatory variable - a highly imperfect measures of the underlying relationship of interest. We re-examine the relationship between taxation, non-tax revenue and democracy by employing dramatically improved data developed specifically for this research. We find the strongest evidence to date of a political resource curse, and provide evidence about the specific details of the underlying relationship: (i) natural resource wealth is anti-democratic, rather than merely stabilizing; (ii) it is driven primarily by changes in the composition of government revenue; (iii) it is best understood as a long-term relationship, rather than short-term changes in resource wealth being quickly translated into major political changes; and (iv) it is driven primarily by oil wealth, rather than mineral wealth, because governments are comparatively effective at translating oil wealth into the government revenues that drive the political resource curse.

The target population were women aged 15-49 in the capital cities of the nine states of the Northeast region of Brazil. We find that more educated women were less likely to report suffering from Zika (or its symptoms) and more likely to report having taken precaution against Zika, such as having used long and light-colored clothes, having used mosquito repellent or insecticides, having used mosquito protective screens or kept windows closed, and having dumped standing water where mosquitoes can breed. In addition, more educated women were more likely to report being informed about the association between Zika and microcephaly and to avoid pregnancy in the last 12 months. Finally, we also find that women who reported experiencing sexual domestic violence in the last 12 months were more likely to report suffering from Zika. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This is partly due to a lack of clinical and economic studies, with the latter increasingly challenged to examine patient preferences for health and nonhealth outcomes (e.g., false-positive rate). Objectives: To conduct a structured review of studies valuing patients' preference-based utility for NGS outcomes, to highlight identified methodological challenges, and to consider how studies addressed identified challenges. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science for published studies examining outcomes from health care decisions informed by NGS. We focused our search on direct elicitations of preference-based utility. We reviewed included studies and qualitatively grouped and summarized stated challenges and solutions by theme. Results: Eleven studies were included. Most of them (n = 6) used discrete choice experiments to value utility. We categorized challenges into four themes: 1) valuing the full range of NGS outcomes, 2) accounting for accuracy and uncertainty surrounding effectiveness, 3) allowing for simultaneous multiple and cascading risks, and 4) incorporating downstream consequences. Studies found strong evidence of utility for NGS information, regardless of health improvement. Investigators addressed challenges by simplifying complex choices, by including health outcomes alongside nonhealth outcomes, and by using multiple elicitation techniques. Conclusions: The breadth and complexity of NGS-derived information makes the technology a unique and challenging application for utility valuation. Failing to account for the utility or disutility of NGS-related nonhealth outcomes may lead to overinvestment or underinvestment in NGS, and so there is a need for research addressing unresolved challenges.","[Regier, Dean A.; Weymann, Deirdre] BC Canc, Canc Control Res, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Buchanan, James; Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Oxford; University of Calgary,"Regier, DA (通讯作者)，BC Canc, Canc Control Res, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada.",dregier@bccrc.ca,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008",Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control; Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute [2015-019789],Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control; Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute(Canadian Cancer Society (CCS)),"Dr. Regier was supported by the Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control, which receives funding from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute grant #2015-019789.

We rely on both firm-level administrative data and individual panel data to show that reducing taxes once registration costs have already been eliminated reduces firm informality. This effect comes from the formalization of existing informal firms, and not from the creation of new formal businesses nor greater formal firm survival.

I study the effect of introducing two idealist candidates to the model who are non-strategic (i.e., fixed to their policy platforms), while allowing for an unlimited number of strategic candidates. Doing so, I show that equilibrium is restored for a non-degenerate set of unimodal distributions. In addition, the equilibria have the following features: (1) the left-most and right-most candidates (i.e., extremists) are idealists; (2) strategic candidates never share their policy platforms, which instead are spread out across the policy space; and (3) if more than one strategic candidate enters, the distribution of voter preferences must be asymmetric.

I develop a new theoretical and empirical framework to analyze the accumulation of capital in its productive and unproductive forms. I also develop a methodology to compute Marxist categories predicated on the idea that the production of knowledge and information is an unproductive activity that relies on the creation of knowledge-rents. In particular, I provide new empirical estimates to uncover the shifting balance between productive and unproductive forms of accumulation. The accumulation pattern observed during the 1947-79 phase that prioritized productive accumulation gave way after the 1980s to a contrasting pattern prioritizing unproductive accumulation. Unproductive activity has been growing at a fast pace in terms of incomes, fixed assets and employment. Among all forms of unproductive activity, my approach places special attention on how the production of knowledge and information has constituted a rising share of total unproductive income and capital stock. Additionally, productive stagnation and rapid unproductive accumulation have been related to greater exploitation of productive workers and to widening income inequality.","[Rotta, Tomas N.] Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England; [Rotta, Tomas N.] Univ Greenwich, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England",University of Greenwich; University of Greenwich,"Rotta, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.;Rotta, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",tomasrotta@gmail.com,,"Rotta, Tomas/0000-0002-5304-9890",,,,,51,11,13,4,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

To do so, I develop a two-country DSGE monetary union model, which I calibrate to the core and periphery regions of the euro area. Monetary policy is set by the ECB, while macroprudential policies, based on the loan-to-value ratio (LW), are set nationally. Results show that, given that the economy in the periphery is more leveraged, macroprudential policies need to be more aggressive in that region. I also find that, when LTV policies are set independently in a non-coordinated manner by each authority, albeit being beneficial for both countries and for the union as a whole, welfare gains are not as high as when they are coordinated and supervised by a separate body.

Importantly, we find that the economic variables have equal or stronger long run impact on females than males, with both groups reacting to changes in family circumstances. Finally, we show that the short run family circumstances are better predictors of self-employment choices rather than economic factors, with self-employment being a means of adjustment to new personal circumstances and economic needs.","[Saridakis, George] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Mohammed, Anne-Marie] Univ West Indies, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Garcia-Iglesias, Jesus M.] Univ Extremadura, Fac Business Finance & Tourism, Caceres, Spain; [Torres, Rebeca I.

We find significant differences in their operating behavior over this period and show that the operating behavior varies with the form of ownership. We also investigate the potential causes of the failure of all DBS in the UK. Our findings show significant changes in the funding and lending strategies of DBS which expose them to higher risk. We also find a strained capital formation and deteriorating capital base of DBS in the post-conversion period. Our results suggest that changes in the business model, diminished capital base and, in part, failing to get all the necessary funding from the wholesale market at the time of the financial crisis of 2007-08 contributed to the demise of a once a successful financial institution in the UK.

J,"Simshauser, P",,,,"Simshauser, Paul",,,Price discrimination and the modes of failure in deregulated retail electricity markets,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price discrimination; Electricity prices; Jawboning,NONDISCRIMINATION CLAUSES; RENEWABLE ENERGY; WEALTH TRANSFERS; COMPETITION; WELFARE; DEMAND; POLICY; DISPERSION; AUSTRALIA; TAXATION,"In Australia, as with Great Britain, governments have shown rising concern with the health of competitive residential electricity markets. A core concern is the practice of price discrimination and the rising dispersion of prices. After almost a decade of Full Retail Contestability, the State of Queensland finally removed its regulated price cap from the residential electricity market in 2016, while almost simultaneously, the two jurisdictions that pioneered this price deregulation reform, Great Britain and Victoria, were questioning their prior policy decision. Queensland makes for a fascinating case study because Southeast Queensland comprises a fully deregulated retail market while Regional Queensland is a regulated monopoly - with common input costs across both zones. Consequently, a regulated monopoly with a uniform tariff and 640,000 customers forms a very large control group, which can be directly compared to the competitive market of more than 13 million customers - making such analysis globally unique. Analysis of Queensland market conditions concludes the policy is welfare enhancing, and that British and Victorian concerns regarding price discrimination practices are misguided. To be clear, rising electricity prices are a problem, but price discrimination is not. The deregulated competitive market is, perhaps unsurprisingly, better at regulating the overall average tariff and consumer welfare has been enhanced by $184 million per annum - with some consumer segments very materially better off. However, certain modes of failure remain, viz. an inter-consumer misallocation problem and lack of transparency vis-a-vis the anchoring of discounts - known as the discounts off what? problem. The former is currently trivial, and the latter requires further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Strengthening cooperation for cross-border electricity trade in South Asia makes it possible for the region to take advantage of significant benefits from greater regional coordination in capacity investments. Trade can complement domestic investment to increase the availability and reliability of supply, bringing economies of scale in investments and more cost-effective expansion of renewable electricity. Efforts to expand cross-border electricity cooperation and trade in SAR need to address not only regional barriers, but also barriers stemming from domestic electricity sector policies in the region. Expanding the scope of bilateral electricity cooperation in the short- and medium-term, and especially opening up to commercial as well as government-to government projects, can build confidence in the process of cross-border trade and the potential benefits it can provide. The longer-term desirable goal is emergence of a well-functioning regional market for electricity, supported by a regional organization or forum for cross-country coordination.","[Singh, Anoop] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Nepal, Rabindra] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Toman, Michael] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur; Durham University; Massey University; The World Bank,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England.",anoops@iitk.ac.in; tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019; Singh, Anoop/H-5985-2016","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206;",,,,,64,36,36,5,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120,,,,,,741,748,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.048,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440123300068,View Full Record in Web of Science

A two-sector new-Keynesian model is developed in which the sectors are connected through factor demand linkages. Moreover, they differ in price stickiness. We obtain two important results: first, the presence of factor demand linkages causes amplification effects in resource mis-allocation and, hence, the concern for price stability becomes relatively more important. Second, the optimal price index is not the same as the aggregate price index, although it does not directly depend on the factor demand linkages themselves. Furthermore, based on the micro-founded loss function we derive a policy rule that implements the optimal allocation.","[Singh, Swapnil] Bank Lithuania, Ctr Excellence Finance & Econ Res, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Singh, Swapnil] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Beetsma, Roel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, MN Chair Pens Econ, POB 15867, NL-1001 NJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beetsma, Roel] European Fiscal Board, Brussels, Belgium; [Beetsma, Roel] CEPR, London, England; [Beetsma, Roel] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Beetsma, Roel] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Beetsma, Roel] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Bank of Lithuania; Kaunas University of Technology; University of Amsterdam; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; Tilburg University; Tinbergen Institute,"Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, MN Chair Pens Econ, POB 15867, NL-1001 NJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，European Fiscal Board, Brussels, Belgium.;Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands.;Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ssingh@lb.lt; R.M.W.J.Beetsma@uva.nl,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2018,166,3,,,,,309,336,,10.1007/s10645-018-9327-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10645-018-9327-x,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4AM,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000439942300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also see wider implications for household economic welfare, demonstrated by reduced self-reported financial distress, better resilience to economic shocks, and a greater capacity to securing basic needs. We argue that program impact may run through three effect channels, namely improved self-efficacy, higher family and community social support, and greater optimism.

We find that Chinese and Russian entrepreneurs have a higher level of well-being, while Ukrainian self-employed individuals have more dissatisfaction. The link between financial development and the utility of entrepreneurs varies as well. The utility differences between the self-employed and paid workers in Russia reduce with financial development and the effect is stronger for job satisfaction. However, financial development barely correlates with Ukrainian entrepreneurs' happiness while having no correlation with life satisfaction of Chinese self-employed. Further investigation suggests that the financial development entrepreneurial utility association works through both monetary and non-monetary channels.","[Tho Pham] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Zhang, Mao] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9RJ, Fife, Scotland",University of Reading; Swansea University; University of St Andrews,"Talavera, O (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",o.talavera@swansea.ac.uk,"Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021","Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X; Pham, Tho/0000-0003-2311-912X",,,,,88,11,12,4,56,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

The negative impacts of financial incomes from interests and dividends are particularly strong for the pre-crisis period.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for TOF is based predominantly on four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of TOF against placebo. Three RCTs investigated TOF in combination with methotrexate (MTX), and one RCT investigated TOF monotherapy. All four RCTs compared TOF with placebo plus cDMARDs, one RCT also included adalimumab as a comparator. The study population in the four RCTs comprised patients who were MTX inadequate responders or cDMARD inadequate responders (cDMARD-IR). The company performed network meta-analyses (NMA) to assess the relative efficacy of TOF compared with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) in patients who were cDMARD-IR or bDMARD-IR with moderate-to-severe RA for European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response and change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index at 6 months. The company's NMA concluded that TOF had comparable efficacy to bDMARDs currently recommended by NICE. The company submitted a de novo model that assessed the cost-effectiveness of TOF versus its comparators in six different populations: (1) cDMARD-IR with severe RA; (2) cDMARD-IR with severe RA for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (3) bDMARD-IR; (4) bDMARD-IR for whom rituximab (RTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated; (5) bDMARD-IR for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; and, (6) cDMARD-IR with moderate RA. According to the company's economic analyses, in cDMARD-IR with severe RA, TOF plus MTX dominates or extendedly dominates most comparators, whilst TOF monotherapy is slightly less effective and less expensive than its comparators, with the cost saved per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lost always higher than 50,000 pound. In bDMARD-IR with severe RA, RTX plus MTX dominated TOF plus MTX, but in patients for whom RTX was not an option, TOF plus MTX dominated all comparators included in the analysis (four comparators recommended by NICE were not included). In cDMARD-IR with moderate RA, the cost per QALY for TOF in combination with MTX or as monotherapy compared with a sequence of cDMARDs was estimated to be greater than 50,000 pound/QALY. The ERG identified a number of limitations in the company's analyses, including use of a fixed-effects model in the NMA and the use of treatment sequences in the cost-effectiveness model which did not reflect NICE recommendations. These limitations were addressed partly by the company during the clarification round and partly by the ERG. The exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG resulted in similar conclusions: (1) TOF plus MTX was dominated by RTX plus MTX; (2) TOF in combination with MTX or as monotherapy dominates or extendedly dominates some of its comparators in cDMARD-IR and bDMARD-IR with severe RA for whom RTX plus MTX was not an option; and (3) in cDMARD-IR with moderate RA, the cost per QALY of TOF in combination with MTX or as a monotherapy versus cDMARDs was in excess of 47,000 pound. The NICE Appraisal Committee consequently recommended TOF plus MTX as an option for patients whose disease has responded inadequately to intensive therapy with a combination of cDMARDs only if (1) disease is severe [a Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of more than 5.1] and (2) the company provides TOF with the discount agreed in the Patient Access Scheme (PAS). TOF plus MTX is also recommended as an option for adults whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot have, other DMARDs, including at least one bDMARD, only if (1) disease is severe, (2) they cannot have RTX, and (3) the company provides TOF with the discount agreed in the PAS. For patients who are intolerant of MTX, or where MTX is contraindicated, TOF monotherapy is recommended where TOF plus MTX would be recommended.","[Uttley, Lesley; Bermejo, Inigo; Ren, Shijie; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Wong, Ruth; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Lifespan & Chron Illness Res, Coll Lane, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; University of Hertfordshire,"Uttley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",l.uttley@sheffield.ac.uk,"Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022; Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; Uttley, Lesley/0000-0003-4603-9069; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [19/04/17],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 19/04/17).

I extend the collective model (Chiappori 1988, 1997) to allow labor choices to affect future bargaining power by raising the value of outside options. Even if household consumption sharing is efficient, labor choices are no longer efficient. Using data on Malawi, where there is predetermined variation in land rights that determine outside options in marriage, I show that individuals spend more time on agricultural labor and less time on wage labor when household land is theirs. They also have lower overall income and consumption. The results are inconsistent with the fully efficient collective model but consistent with a noncooperative model with limited commitment, where individuals allocate their labor supply to maximize future bargaining power. Limited commitment can lead to inefficient allocations that reduce household welfare.","[Walther, Selma] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Walther, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",s.walther@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,15,19,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

It is now clear that climate change and its devastating impacts cannot be resolved by new technology or governance alone. They require a broader, cultural shift. As a result, the role of human beings 'inner dimensions' and related transformations is attracting increased attention from researchers. Recent advances in neuroscience suggest for instance that mindfulness can open new pathways towards sustainability. However, the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation has been largely ignored. This paper is the first exploratory empirical investigation into linking individuals' intrinsic mindfulness (as opposed to outside mindfulness interventions) to pro- and reactive climate adaptation. Based on a survey of citizens at risk from severe climate events, we explore if, and how individual mindfulness is correlated with climate adaptation at different scales. The results show that individual mindfulness coincides with higher motivation to take climate adaptation actions or to support them, especially actions that are 'other-focused' or support pro-environmental behaviour. Mindfulness may also corroborate the acknowledgement of climate change and associated risk perception, and it may steer people away from fatalistic attitudes. We conclude with a call for more research into the relationship between human beings' inner dimensions and climate adaptation in the wider public domain.","[Warnsler, Christine; Brink, Ebba] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Global Dev Inst, Global Urbanism Res Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Warnsler, Christine] Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Lund Univ, CRAM, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Lund University,"Warnsler, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, LUCSUS, Box 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.warrisler@lucsus.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project [2011-901],Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project,"This research has been conducted in the context of the Contemplative Sustainable Futures Program at LUCSUS, Lund University.

It provides a range of powers, mostly permissive rather than mandatory. The general emphasis of the Act displays marked shift from the previous focus on competition as a major policy aim, to one in which partnerships between operators and local transport authorities are encouraged. Procedures for franchising are simplified, in contrast to those under the 2000 and 2008 Acts, which did not result in any franchising scheme outside London being introduced. The changes relate to a number of themes examined in previous Thredbo conferences, including aspects of competition law, service tendering, data disclosure and network planning. This paper begins by examining the historical background to the Act, then discusses its main provisions. Data requirements for research to monitor the possible effects of its implementation are outlined. It is concluded that the Act has the potential to encourage greater bus use, but the extent of this is highly uncertain.","[White, Peter] Univ Westminster, Dept Planning & Transport, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Westminster,"White, P (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Dept Planning & Transport, London NW1 5LS, England.",whitep1@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,9,9,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

One obstacle to translating NGS into routine health care has been a lack of clinical trials evaluating NGS technologies, which could be used to populate cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). A key question is whether big data can be used to partially support CEAs of NGS. This question has been brought into sharp focus with the creation of large national sequencing initiatives. In this article we summarize the main methodological and practical challenges of using big data as an input into CEAs of NGS. Our focus is on the challenges of using large observational datasets and cohort studies and linking these data to the genomic information obtained from NGS, as is being pursued in the conduct of large genomic sequencing initiatives. We propose potential solutions to these key challenges. We conclude that the use of genomic big data to support and inform CEAs of NGS technologies holds great promise. Nevertheless, health economists face substantial challenges when using these data and must be cognizant of them before big data can be confidently used to produce evidence on the cost-effectiveness of NGS.","[Wordsworth, Sarah; Doble, Brett; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Richard Doll Bldg,Old Rd Campus, Oxford 0X3 7AE, England; [Wordsworth, Sarah; Doble, Brett; Buchanan, James] Oxford Natl Inst Hlth Res, Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Sch Hlth Sci, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Div Populat Hlth Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [McCabe, Christopher] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] BC Canc, Canc Control Res, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control ARCC, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Manchester; University of Calgary; University of Alberta; University of British Columbia,"Wordsworth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Richard Doll Bldg,Old Rd Campus, Oxford 0X3 7AE, England.",sarah.wordsworth@ndph.ox.ac.uk,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Doble, Brett/0000-0002-4948-8831; Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040","Oxford National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK","Oxford National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK","S.W., B.D., and J.B. are partly funded by the Oxford National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK.

A nested Markov model was employed using the perspective of the British National Health Service (NHS). Effectiveness outcomes were the 10-year CVD risk of individuals with mild (4-6 mmol/l) and high (above 6 mmol/l) cholesterol by gender and age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-85 years); CVD events avoided and QALY gains over 20 years. This study found that daily consumption of enriched spread reduces CVD risks more for men and older age groups. Assuming 50% compliance, 69 CVD events per 10,000 men and 40 CVD events per 10,000 women would be saved over 20 years. If the NHS pays the excess cost of enriched spreads, for the high-cholesterol group, the probability of enriched spreads being cost-effective is 100% for men aged over 64 years and women over 74, at 20,000 pound/QALY threshold. Probabilities of cost-effectiveness are lower at younger ages, with mildly elevated cholesterol and over a 10-year time horizon. If consumers bear the full cost of enriched spreads, NHS savings arise from reduced CVD events.","[Yang, Wei] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Gage, Heather; Jackson, Daniel] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Raats, Monique] Univ Surrey, Food Consumer Behav & Hlth Res Ctr, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Sch Psychol, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Surrey; University of Surrey,"Yang, W (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London WC2R 2LS, England.",wei.yang@kcl.ac.uk; h.gage@surrey.ac.uk; d.jackson@surry.ac.uk; m.raats@surrey.ac.uk,"Raats, Monique/G-5348-2012","Raats, Monique/0000-0002-8057-2783; Gage, Heather/0000-0002-2049-9406",,,,,49,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this paper we characterize surplus-maximizing (efficient) and revenue-maximizing (optimal) mechanisms in a spectrum sharing context where a principal allocates transmitted power among a group of potentially interested users (transmitter-receiver pairs). Under regularity conditions about value distributions and non-interference constraints, we show that efficiency (optimality) typically involves spectrum sharing by multiple users, and the exact allocation of transmitted power is determined such that the ratio of marginal value (virtual value) over marginal cost (in terms of the cost to the interference generated) is equal among all shared users. We show that efficient and optimal mechanisms in our setting are actually dominant-strategy incentive compatible, and that they can also be implemented by well-designed all-pay or discriminatory-price auctions.

This generates a number of internal inconsistencies and anomalies. The FTPL is not about endogenous money issuance guaranteeing solvency of the State when public spending and taxes are exogenous. The problem is not about empirical content or the realism of the assumptions, but about flawed internal logic. The issue is not just of academic interest. If fiscal authorities were to take the FTPL seriously, costly policy accidents, including sovereign default and hyperinflation, could result. Interpreting the FTPL as an equilibrium selection mechanism in models with multiple equilibria does not help. Attempts by Sims to extend the FTPL to models with nominal price rigidities fail. The attempted resurrection of the FTPL fails.","[Buiter, Willem H.] Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Sibert, Anne C.] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA.",willem.buiter@citi.com,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 2,2018,12,,,,,,,,201848,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-48,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-48,,,56,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GQ0PM,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000441321700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Empirical insights from India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Group farming; Women's groups; Small family farms; Agricultural productivity and profitability; Asia; India,AGRICULTURE; COLLECTIVIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; TRANSITION; STRATEGY; VIETNAM,"Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala's groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context. (C) 2018 The Author.

However, recent surveys highlight the growing tendency by younger generations to change drinking-style. This increases the concern over adoption of unhealthy consumption behaviours that might be carried over in later age. What remains unexplored are the details of these emerging consumption patterns. The objective of this paper is to cast some light on these phenomena using stated choice data. This study quantitatively explores consumption contexts and links them to characteristics of young Italians. Data collected from a questionnaire completed by 556 respondents are used to estimate a Latent Class Model. Results reveal the existence of eight distinct consumption patterns, some of them far from the Mediterranean tradition. Socialization is the main motivation for alcohol consumption.

While at the product level, the pattern of specialisation barely changed, exporters exhibit new dynamics in international markets: firms not only expanded sales abroad by increasing their exports in existing markets, but also by entering into new destinations and adding new products. That is, new export strategies allowed exporters achieve greater resistance to the variations in the macroeconomic environment. We find that the importance of the different export margins changes overtime: while the currency is depreciated, the intensive margin explains most of export growth, whereas the subextensive and extensive margins become the main source of export growth once the currency appreciates. We also uncover a strong complementarity between import and export growth.","[Albornoz, Facundo] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Albornoz, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Nottingham, England; [Lembergman, Ezequiel Garcia] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Juarez, Leticia] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Nottingham; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England.;Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Nottingham, England.",,,"Albornoz, Facundo/0000-0001-8123-0550",,,,,30,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2018,41,8,,,SI,,2129,2148,,10.1111/twec.12653,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12653,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GQ1ZZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000441445000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using Census data from the years before and after democratization, we compare the evolution of conflict across districts experiencing differential changes in ethnic composition. We find that ethnic polarization and inequality within the Black majority correlate strongly and positively with the incidence of armed confrontations between Black-dominated groups.

More specifically, we use unique data from the US, UK, and Italy to show that two major classes of social resource-personality and social capital-are significant predictors of planning capacity. We use the data to estimate frontier models that help establish three empirical facts about the ability to plan. First, planning ability depends on a rich array of social resources including networks, the freedom to participate, neighbourhood co-operation, and trust (social capital) and personality traits such as extroversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. Secondly, we provide evidence that some personalities are more efficient than others in using resources to help them plan. Thirdly, we develop evidence of three personality profiles, referred to as 'over-controlled', 'resilient' and 'under-controlled,' and highlight the fact that these three profiles benefit differently from various aspects of social resources capital. We discuss these findings and conclude that a wide range of economic policies designed to facilitate individual planning may need to allow for heterogeneities in social resources if they are to be successful.","[Anand, Paul] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Anand, Paul] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Anand, Paul] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Poggi, Ambra] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Poggi, Ambra] Coll Carlo Alberto, Lab R Revelli, Turin, Italy",Open University - UK; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Milano-Bicocca; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Anand, P (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",paul.anand@open.ac.uk,,"Anand, Paul/0000-0002-7701-6903",,,,,127,9,9,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2018,71,3,,,,,343,373,,10.1111/kykl.12173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/kykl.12173,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4RL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000440000700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, we decompose the wage gap using the counterfactual decomposition into endowment effect (explained by differences in characteristics) and a discrimination effect (attributable to unequal returns to covariates).

Our identification strategy relies on the quasi-random assignment of students to different class sizes based on maximum class size rules. In Germany, students are tracked into more or less academic middle school types at about age ten based, to a large extent, on academic achievement in elementary school. We mostly find no or small effects of class size in elementary school on receiving a recommendation or on the actual choice to attend the more academic middle school type. For male students, we find that an increase in class size by 10 students would reduce their chance of attending the higher school track-which more than 40% of students attend-by 3 percentage points.","[Argaw, Bethlehem A.; Puhani, Patrick A.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Arbeitsokon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Puhani, Patrick A.] UCL, CReAM, London, England; [Puhani, Patrick A.] Univ St Gallen, SEW, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Puhani, Patrick A.] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Puhani, Patrick A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; University College London; University of St Gallen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Puhani, PA (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Arbeitsokon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",puhani@aoek.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,26,3,5,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Centralization and routinization are negatively related to dynamic capabilities, and formalization has a significantly positive effect.

The technology has spread rapidly in the developing world, leapfrogging the provision of formal banking services by solving the problems of weak institutional infrastructure and the cost structure of conventional banking. This article examines the evolution of mobile money and its important role in widening financial inclusion. It explores the channels of economic influence of mobile money from a micro perspective, and critically reviews the empirical literature on the economic impact of mobile money. The evidence convincingly suggests that mobile money fosters risk-sharing, but direct evidence of the promotion of welfare and saving is still mostly rather less robust.","[Aron, Janine] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Aron, Janine] Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Aron, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England.;Aron, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Study African Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",,,,Gates Foundation [MQRYDE00]; Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School,Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School,"Janine Aron is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, UK; Centre for the Study of African Economies, Department of Economics, Manor Road Building, Oxford OX1 3UQ.

The empirical evidence is based on 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008. Domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism variables are used. Absolute (or unconditional) and conditional catch-ups are estimated using Generalised Method of Moments. We establish consistently that, the rate of catch-up is higher in domestic terrorism relative to transnational terrorism. The time to full catch-up required for the implementation of common policies without distinction of nationality is found to be in a horizon of 13-20years for domestic terrorism and 24-28years for transnational terrorism. Hence, from a projection date of 2009, in spite of decreasing cross-country differences in terrorists' attacks, there is still a long way to go before feasible common policy initiatives can be fully implemented without distinction of nationality. The paper is original by its contribution to the empirics of conflict resolution through decreasing cross-country differences in terrorism tendencies.

Policymakers require objective evidence to base decisions on which public policies or investments to pursue. In this paper we develop an economy-wide approach to assessing public investments in tourism. The approach is powerful in that it considers all intersectoral linkages that are critical for tourism-sector analysis. This framework is linked to a microsimulation module that enables estimation of household-level and destination-specific impacts and the distribution of benefits. To illustrate the framework and the insights it can generate, we apply it to a public investment in Belize's Cayo District. Our findings show that the overall level of economic activity increases while an appreciation of the real regional exchange rate results in slower growth in traditional nontourism exports. Greater availability of capital and labor to meet increased demand would reduce this effect. The investment results in a reduction in the poverty headcount on the order of 0.7 percentage points, though there is a small increase in inequality that is a function of the skill requirements of the new positions created as a result of the investment.","[Banerjee, Onil; Moreda, Adela] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Cicowiez, Martin] Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Morris, Emily J.] UCL, London, England",Inter-American Development Bank; National University of La Plata; University of London; University College London,"Banerjee, O (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",onilb@iadb.org,"Morris, Emily/JRY-8556-2023; Morris, Emily/HZJ-5380-2023","Morris, Emily/0000-0002-9171-1080; Cicowiez, Martin/0000-0001-6616-7370",Inter-American Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank,This study was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank.,,44,7,7,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants' endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists' prescriptions.

Building on the results, we make a twofold contribution. First, we propose a novel stable money demand equation relying on two crucial factors: a speculative motive, represented by domestic and foreign price-earnings ratios, and a precautionary motive, measured by changes in unemployment. Second, we use the model to derive relevant policy implications for the ECB, since excess liquidity looks more useful for forecasting stock market busts than future inflation. Overall, this evidence points to (i) a possible evolution of the monetary pillar in the direction of pursuing financial stability and (ii) the exclusion of a sudden liquidity-driven inflationary burst after the exit from the prolonged period of unconventional monetary measures.","[Barigozzi, Matteo] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Conti, Antonio M.] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy; [Conti, Antonio M.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Conti, AM (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Rome, Italy.;Conti, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",antoniomaria.conti@bancaditalia.it,"Barigozzi, Matteo/B-7145-2017","Barigozzi, Matteo/0000-0001-9090-5708",,,,,69,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

We conjecture that discrimination will be weaker when social norms oppose it. Our results support this prediction. Using a Krupka-Weber social norm elicitation task, we find participants perceive it to be more socially inappropriate to discriminate on the basis of nationality than on the basis of social identities artificially induced using a trivial minimal group technique. Correspondingly, we find that participants discriminate more in the artificial identity setting. Our results suggest norms and the preference to comply with them affect discriminatory decisions and that the social inappropriateness of discrimination moderates discriminatory behaviour.

Although largely isolated from the other large economies until 2007, growth in China is subsequently strongly related to that of the US and the Euro area. The effects are illustrated using generalised impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions. The increased international synchronisation found may be associated with the effects of the Great Recession on the US and Euro area together with China's extraordinary export growth since joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001.","[Bataa, Erdenebat] Natl Univ Mongolia, Dept Econ, Baga Toiruu 4, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Osborn, Denise R.; Sensier, Marianne] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Osborn, Denise R.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas, Australia",National University of Mongolia; University of Manchester; University of Tasmania,"Sensier, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",tsors79@yahoo.com; denise.osborn@manchester.ac.uk; marianne.sensier@manchester.ac.uk,"Bataa, Erdenebat/HKM-4412-2023; Bataa, Erdenebat/AAY-9358-2021; Osborn, Denise/B-8692-2008; Purevsuren, Tseveg/O-6645-2019; Bataa, Erdenebat/L-5104-2019","Sensier, Marianne/0000-0001-8966-2403; Bataa, Erdenebat/0000-0001-5087-5989; Osborn, Denise/0000-0001-5534-8926",National University of Mongolia [P2017-2466]; Economic and Social Research Council Rising Powers project [ES/J012785/1],National University of Mongolia; Economic and Social Research Council Rising Powers project,This work was supported by the National University of Mongolia [grant number P2017-2466]; and Economic and Social Research Council Rising Powers project [grant number ES/J012785/1].,,36,9,9,2,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The paper presents a novel explanation of order effects, relating to attention and novelty. Typically, multiple valuation tasks for consumer goods use the same good for valuation in each task. In this experiment the type of good valued in each task is varied, allowing two potential mechanisms to be disentangled: experimental novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with completing later tasks, and good-specific novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with the goods used in later tasks. The results find a particular importance of the first task; goods in the first task are valued significantly higher than later valued goods, evidence of experimental novelty effects, and goods of a similar type to the good in the first task are valued significantly higher than goods of a different type to the first, evidence of good-specific novelty. The paper discusses the potential implications of these findings.","[Belton, Cameron A.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Sugden, Robert] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Ctr Behav & Expt Social Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University of East Anglia,"Sugden, R (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Ctr Behav & Expt Social Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",cameron.belton@esri.ie; r.sugden@uea.ac.uk,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012","Belton, Cameron/0000-0002-7344-250X; Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139",Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS); University of East Anglia,Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS); University of East Anglia,The authors would like to give thanks to the Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS) and the University of East Anglia for financial support.

In this paper we investigate both the temporal and spatial dynamics of formative phases by which energy technologies prepare for growth. Drawing on a review of diverse literatures, we offer a definition of the formative phase which clarifies its scope and duration, and identifies its main technological and economic determinants. We use parametric hazard models to assess the relative strengths of these determinants on formative phase durations for a sample of 15 energy technologies diffusing over time in their respective initial markets. We find that substitutability has stronger effects in accelerating the end of formative phases than installed capacity and prices. We extend our analysis using nonparametric models to analyze the spatial diffusion of formative phase durations from initial to follower markets. We find that formative phase durations are long outside initial markets as well, showing only signs of acceleration in latecomer regions. Our results imply risks for policies trying to accelerate the diffusion of large innovations without ready markets in both initial and follower markets.","[Bento, Nuno] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bento, Nuno] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Charlie] UEA, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wilson, Charlie] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Ctr Environm Energy & Nat Resource Governance, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Harvard University; University of East Anglia; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Cambridge,"Bento, N (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",Nuno.Bento@iscte.pt,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011","Bento, Nuno/0000-0002-5923-0666; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BPD/91183/2012]; European Union [730403 - INNOPATHS],International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research on which this article is based was supported by a grant from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and Harvard Kennedy School.

The stated objective of this policy is to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development in the global South. In spite of the widespread use of this policy tool, very little is known about its effect on emissions. In this paper we perform an empirical audit of the effectiveness of energy-related aid in tackling CO2 and SO2 emissions. Using a global panel dataset covering 128 countries over the period 1971-2011 and estimating a parsimonious model using the Anderson and Hsiao estimator, we do not find any evidence of a systematic effect of energy-related aid on emissions. We also find that the non-effect is not conditional on institutional quality or level of income. Countries located in Europe and Central Asia do better than others in utilizing this aid to reduce CO2 emissions. Our results are robust after controlling for the environmental Kuznets curve, country fixed effects, country-specific trends, and time-varying common shocks.","[Bhattacharyya, Sambit; Intartaglia, Maurizio; Mckay, Andy] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Bhattacharyya, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",S.bhattacharyya@sussex.ac.uk,"Bhattacharyya, Sambit/F-6814-2011","McKay, Andy/0000-0002-5815-1739; Bhattacharyya, Sambit/0000-0001-5932-6943",Directorate-General for Research and Innovation [308601],Directorate-General for Research and Innovation,"Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Grant/Award Number: 308601",,34,13,14,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This is an aspect of the endogeneity of the optimum currency area criteria that has been largely ignored. Empirical evidence from three currency unions tends to suggest some degree of endogeneity of price flexibility, but the rate of adjustment is slow. Self-selection into currency unions by countries with naturally greater price flexibility does not appear to be a significant factor.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Yin, Lin] China Railway Party Sch, Econ Res Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk; 951298673@qq.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

In this setting, we find that the big four eurozone economies (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) can effectively escape from their liquidity trap through fiscal policy interventions caused by government purchases. We estimate the government spending multiplier to be above 1.8 when this policy is associated with a long-term commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate at the zero lower bound, as suggested by Krugman (1998). Notably, the short-term deficit effect on the budget balance can be offset five years after the implementation of a large spending program. We also show that alternative policies with tax cuts that expand the supply do not appear to have the same power in the short run. Moreover, we provide novel empirical evidence that a large government debt renders a government spending policy ineffective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the conditional quantile dependence and indicate that the global financial stress index strongly Granger-causes Bitcoin returns at the left and right tail of the distribution of the Bitcoin returns, conditional on the global financial stress index. Finally, we use a bivariate cross-quantilogram approach and show only limited directional predictability from the global financial stress index to Bitcoin returns in the medium term, for which Bitcoin can act as a safe-haven against global financial stress.

In the absence of majority ties-e.g., when there is an odd number of agents with linear preferences-the majority relation is antisymmetric and complete and can thus conveniently be represented by a tournament. Tournaments have a rich mathematical theory and many formal results for majoritarian functions assume that the majority relation constitutes a tournament. Moreover, most majoritarian functions have only been defined for tournaments and allow for a variety of generalizations to unrestricted preference profiles, none of which can be seen as the unequivocal extension of the original function. In this paper, we argue that restricting attention to tournaments is justified by the existence of a conservative extension, which inherits most of the commonly considered properties from its underlying tournament solution.","[Brandt, Felix] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Informat, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Brill, Markus] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Softwaretech & Theoret Informat, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Harrenstein, Paul] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 3QD, England",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Berlin; University of Oxford,"Brill, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Softwaretech & Theoret Informat, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",brandtf@in.tum.de; brill@tu-berlin.de; paul.harrenstein@cs.ox.ac.uk,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023","Brill, Markus/0000-0001-9509-7017","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/7-2]; Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ERC [291528, 639945]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Grant BR 2312/7-2, by a Feodor Lynen research fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and by the ERC under Advanced Grant 291528 (RACE) and Starting Grant 639945 (ACCORD).

However, little is known about how CTs achieve this impact. We conducted a mixed-method review of studies in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fourteen quantitative and eight qualitative studies met our inclusion criteria, of which eleven and five, respectively, demonstrated evidence that CTs decrease IPV. We found little support for increases in IPV, with only two studies showing overall mixed or adverse impacts. Drawing on these studies, as well as related bodies of evidence, we developed a program theory proposing three pathways through which CT could impact IPV: (a) economic security and emotional well-being, (b) intra-household conflict, and (c) women's empowerment. The economic security and well-being pathway hypothesizes decreases in IPV, while the other two pathways have ambiguous effects depending on program design features and behavioral responses to program components. Future studies should improve IPV measurement, empirical analysis of program mechanisms, and fill regional gaps. Program framing and complementary activities, including those with the ability to shift intra-household power relations are likely to be important design features for understanding how to maximize and leverage the impact of CTs for reducing IPV, and mitigating potential adverse impacts.

We suggest that existing work on effectiveness of macroprudential policy may be vulnerable to bias due to omission of long run cointegration effects. This paper seeks to offer a fresh baseline for work in this area by adopting a cointegration framework which is robust to a variety of alternative techniques and compares favourably with non-cointegrated alternatives. We assess the impact of typical macroprudential policy interventions on house price and household credit growth in up to 19 OECD countries, using three datasets from the IMF and BIS, thus giving both a wider range of control variables and broader coverage of instruments than in most extant work. We find evidence that macroprudential polices remain effective in both short- and long-run at curbing house price and household credit growth even within a cointegration framework, albeit some tools are more effective than others. These include, in particular, taxes on financial institutions, general capital requirements, strict loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratio limits. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Despite this is crucial to design effective policies of formal elderly care, empirical evidence is scant due to the lack of credible identification strategies to account for the endogeneity of formal care. We propose a novel instrument, an index that captures individuals' eligibility status for the long-term care programs implemented in the region of residence. Our estimates, which are robust to a number of different specifications, suggest that higher formal care provision would lead to an increase in informal care utilization as well. In the context of current theoretical economic model of care use, this result points to the existence of a substantial unmet demand of care among older people in Europe.","[Carrino, Ludovico] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London, England; [Carrino, Ludovico; Orso, Cristina Elisa; Pasini, Giacomo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Pasini, Giacomo] NETSPAR, Networks Studies Pens Aging & Retirement, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of London; King's College London; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Tilburg University,"Pasini, G (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",giacomo.pasini@unive.it,"Pasini, Giacomo/E-7032-2014","Pasini, Giacomo/0000-0002-2052-3453; Carrino, Ludovico/0000-0002-5082-5508",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P000487/1]; Fondazione Farmafactoring; ESRC [ES/P000487/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Fondazione Farmafactoring(Fondazione CarifeFondazione Caritro); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ES/P000487/1; Fondazione Farmafactoring, Grant/Award Number: Research Award 2015",,35,23,23,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27,8,,,,,1175,1188,,10.1002/hec.3665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3665,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29696714,Green Published,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000437114300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use a questionnaire survey to collect data from 325 SMEs in the semi-arid regions of Kenya and Senegal and analyze this information to estimate the quality of current adaptation measures, distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable adaptation. We then study the link between these current adaptation practices and adaptation planning for future climate change. We find that financial barriers are a key reason why firms resort to unsustainable adaptation, while general business support, access to information technology and adaptation assistance encourages sustainable adaptation responses. Engaging in adaptation today also increases the likelihood that a firm is preparing for future climate change. The finding lends support to the strategy of many development agencies who use adaptation to current climate variability as a way of building resilience to future climate change. There is a clear role for public policy in facilitating good adaptation. The ability of firms to respond to climate risks depends in no small measure on factors such as business environment that can be shaped through policy intervention.

It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrantscontributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.","[Crymble, Adam] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Dennett, Adam] UCL, London, England; [Hitchcock, Tim] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Hertfordshire; University of London; University College London; University of Sussex,"Crymble, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England.",adam.crymble@gmail.com,"Dennett, Adam/P-1681-2018","Dennett, Adam/0000-0001-8036-0185",British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [SG120758]; AHRC [AH/L006863/1] Funding Source: UKRI,British Academy/Leverhulme Trust; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The authors would like to thank Louise Falcini, Hannah Fry, Ian Gazeley, Guy Abel, and Emma Dennett for support and advice on earlier drafts of this article, and to the audiences at the Long Eighteenth Century Seminar at the University of Oxford (2013), the European Social Science History Conference (2014), the GIS Research UK conference (2015), and the First International Conference on Geographies of Migration and Mobility (2016) for feedback.

Our empirical analysis is based on a novel panel data set of 177 Western European banks observed from 2008 to 2015, in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. We find that IRB banks were able to curb the increase in credit risk driven by the macroeconomic slowdown better than banks under the standardized approach.

Analyzing geo-enriched data on nearly 4,800 hotel transactions in the United States, we find that the relative positioning of an asset's attributes - particularly at the extremes - has a significant impact on transaction prices. We also detect separating equilibria for extreme attributes across the premium and discount hotel segments. Extreme attributes stand out and are value enhancing in premium hotel segments. In contrast, extreme attributes are value diminishing in the discount hotel segment. The relative degree to which the asset's attributes are extreme is important. Being a locally largest asset has a negative effect on price, however the negative effect is more than offset if the hotel is among the largest hotels nationally. The results suggest that locally extreme assets, unless also nationally extreme, are considered atypical and trade at a discount.","[Das, Prashant] Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Smith, Patrick] San Diego State Univ, Fowler Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Gallimore, Paul] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Reading,"Das, P (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland.",prashant.das@ehl.ch; patrick.smith@sdsu.edu; p.gallimore@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Das, Prashant/0000-0002-3628-7213",,,,,55,7,9,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Methods: This mapping study used data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologic Interventions Register-a pharmacovigilance register comprising patients with moderate to severe psoriasis on systemic therapies. Conceptual overlap between the EQ-5D-3L and DLQI was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficients and exploratory factor analysis. Six regression methods to predict the EQ-5D-3L index (direct mapping) and two regression methods to predict EQ-5D-3L domain responses (response mapping) were tested. Random effects models were explored to account for repeated observations from the same individual. Estimated and actual EQ-5D-3L utility scores were compared using 10-fold cross-validation (in-sample) to evaluate predictive performance. Final models were selected using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean error. Results: The data set comprised 22,085 observations for which DLQI and EQ-5D-3L were recorded on the same day. A moderate correlation was found between the measures (r = -0.47). Exploratory factor analysis showed that two EQ-5D-3L domains (pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety) were associated with all six DLQI domains. The best-performing model used ordinary least squares with DLQI items, age, and sex as explanatory variables (with squared, cubic, and interaction terms). A tool was produced to allow users to map their data to the EQ-5D-3L, and includes algorithms that require fewer variables (e.g., total DLQI scores). Conclusions: This study produced mapping algorithms that can generate EQ-5D-3L utility scores from DLQI data for economic evaluations of health interventions for patients with psoriasis.","[Davison, Niall J.; Thompson, Alexander J.; Turner, Alexander J.; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, 4th Floor Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Longworth, Louise] Berkeley Works, PHMR, London, England; [McElhone, Kathleen; Griffiths, Christopher E.

Economic assessment of adaptation options needs to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty of future climate conditions and should recognise that uncertainties may diminish over time as a result of improved understanding and learning. Real options analysis (ROA) is an appraisal tool developed to incorporate concepts of flexibility and learning that relies on probabilistic data to characterise uncertainties. It is also a relatively resource-intensive decision support tool. We test whether, and to what extent, learning can result from the use of successive generations of real life climate scenarios, and how non-probabilistic uncertainties can be handled through adapting the principles of ROA in coastal economic adaptation decisions. Using a relatively simple form of ROA on a vulnerable piece of coastal rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom, and two successive UK climate assessments, we estimate the values associated with utilising up-dated information on sea-level rise. The value of learning can be compared to the capital cost of adaptation investment, and may be used to illustrate the potential scale of the value of learning in coastal protection, and other adaptation contexts.","[Dawson, David A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Civil Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hunt, Alistair] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Shaw, Jon] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Gehrels, W.

Large variations in energy expenditure shares are identified, with the shares being significantly higher in New Member States than the EU15. First, these variations indicate that a single expenditure-based pan-EU fuel poverty metric is problematic; there is a trade-off between a metric identifying households in most need within individual Member States and one identifying households in a similar position across Member States. Second, household-level data from the UK, France and the Republic of Ireland are used to simulate the impact of 'policy interventions', involving energy expenditure reductions or income increases, on the recorded rate of fuel poverty. These simulations highlight that emphasising high-level fuel poverty metrics may distort policymakers' choices towards improving the 'picture' of fuel poverty rather than maximising welfare improvements. Robust impact assessments identifying the fuel poverty interventions which deliver the greatest welfare increases for a given cost offer a better means of policy evaluation.","[Deller, David] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Deller, D (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",david.deller@uea.ac.uk,,"Deller, David/0000-0001-7398-6083","Microsoft; EDF Energy; Utility Regulator Northern Ireland; E-Control, Austrian energy regulator through Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE); EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Microsoft(Microsoft); EDF Energy; Utility Regulator Northern Ireland; E-Control, Austrian energy regulator through Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by Microsoft, EDF Energy, the Utility Regulator Northern Ireland and E-Control, the Austrian energy regulator, through the Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE).",,33,30,30,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119,,,,,,168,182,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.033,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000439671200017,View Full Record in Web of Science

For instance, a retailer might raise the retail price of an item just before a sale and then promote the product by listing the initial price as the sales price. This paper addresses the question under what conditions would a firm give such a 'false' promotion and with what regularity? with an analytical model composed of two competing retailers and two segments of consumers. The duopoly firms sell substitutable products in a finite number of periods to consumers. In each period, each firm can choose to offer a real promotion, a false promotion, or no promotion. One segment of consumers is sophisticated and is able to discern false promotions based on the two firms' promotional offerings. The other segment of consumers is naive and trusts each firm's claimed promotional offering. Sophisticated consumers pass information on the existence of false promotions via word-of-mouth (WOM) to a fraction of naive consumers. We find that the possibility of offering false promotions can improve the payoffs for both firms, especially when the market is more competitive. Moreover, even when consumers can identify that a firm is offering a false promotion and pass this information to others, a firm still finds it optimal to offer such promotions from time to time. In general, the firm is more likely to offer false promotions in an environment with lower competition, fewer sophisticated consumers, and weaker WOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Dioikitopoulos, EV",,,,"Dioikitopoulos, Evangelos V.",,,Dynamic adjustment of fiscal policy under a debt crisis,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal sustainability; Fiscal rules; Bond-financed deficits,OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS; PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE; GOVERNMENT; INVESTMENT,"In an overlapping generations framework that allows for the presence of a debt crisis scenario (debt bubbles), we introduce productive government expenditures, and endogenous deficits through a dynamic fiscal rule that combines fiscal stimulus and fiscal consolidation. We formally argue that a fiscal rule must be pro-cyclical to output for government investment financing and simultaneously has to control for the level of debt adjusting taxation for a policy aiming to escape a situation of exploding debt and low economic activity. Then, when the economy becomes sustainable (or in an economy's high initial private capital), the same rule, has to endogenously adapt to the actual level of debt and income in order to stimulate private investment through lower taxes. We provide a numerical example for our theoretical results and show that in economies with sufficiently low levels of capital and high levels of debt, the tax rate has to adjust non-monotonically during the recover process, reflecting the two counter-balancing properties of the examined fiscal policy rule. However, under a threshold level of initial capital stock, taxes must adjust monotonically (negatively) to boost private investment activity, and in turn, alleviating the volume of debt though a higher tax base.

Perspective UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Results In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below 10,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was 4927 pound per QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in the biologic-naive population. Conclusions Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with active AS. Further research on long-term radiographic progression outcomes would be valuable for future cost-effectiveness analyses in AS.","[Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Rheumat & Musculoskeletal Med, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Leeds Teaching Hosp NHS Trust, NIHR Leeds Biomed Res Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Van Keep, Marjolijn] BresMed Netherlands BV, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Beard, Steve] BresMed, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Chris; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Jugl, Steffen Marc] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, India; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England",University of Leeds; Leeds Biomedical Research Centre; University of Leeds; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis,"Halliday, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.co,"emery, paul/B-3560-2013","Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095; Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,23,14,15,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2018,36,8,,,,,1015,1027,,10.1007/s40273-018-0675-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0675-9,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GK9SK,29797186,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000436593900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A Markov decision model was constructed. Effectiveness was measured by re-intervention on the truncal vein, re-treatment of residual varicosities, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 5 years. Model inputs were estimated from systematic review, the UK National Health Service unit costs, and manufacturers' list prices. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Results: CONS has the lowest overall cost and quality of life per person over 5 years; HL/S, EVLA, RFA, and MOCA have on average similar costs and effectiveness; and CAE has the highest overall cost but is no more effective than other therapies. The incremental cost per QALY of RFA versus CONS was 5,148 pound/QALY. Time to return to work or normal activities was significantly longer after HL/S than after other procedures. Conclusions: At a threshold of 20,000 pound/QALY, RFA was the treatment with highest median rank for net benefit, with MOCA second, EVLA third, HL/S fourth, CAE fifth, and CONS and UGFS sixth. Further evidence on effectiveness and health-related quality of life for MOCA and CAE is needed. At current prices, CAE is not a cost-effective option because it is costlier but has not been shown to be more effective than other options.","[Epstein, David] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Sch Econ & Business Studies, Granada, Spain; [Onida, Sarah; Bootun, Roshan; Davies, Alun H.] Imperial Coll London, Acad Sect Vasc Surg, Div Surg, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England; [Onida, Sarah; Bootun, Roshan; Davies, Alun H.] Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Ortega-Ortega, Marta] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of Granada; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Complutense University of Madrid,"Ortega-Ortega, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",martao@ucm.es,"Epstein, David/I-2839-2019; Bootun, Roshan/AAB-8035-2020","Epstein, David/0000-0002-2275-0916; Bootun, Roshan/0000-0002-2378-6232; ORTEGA-ORTEGA, MARTA/0000-0001-8164-9415; Onida, Sarah/0000-0001-5926-4578",Vascular Insights,Vascular Insights,"This study was financed by Vascular Insights, manufacturer of ClariVein.

In this paper, we describe the evolution of this market in the UK. Using an inductive qualitative longitudinal research design, we analyse the emerging views of entrepreneurs and investors towards ECF. Our interviewees include large and small-scale investors, as well as market participants who have chosen not to invest or raise funds via ECF. We find that the large financial flows to entrepreneurs in the UK via the ECF platforms, nearly half a billion GBP since 2011, have probably been largely incremental to traditional sources of early stage entrepreneurial finance. Moreover, our research indicates that for the most part, investors appear to understand and appropriately evaluate the risks that they are bearing; ECF investments are perceived as a high risk, high return component within individuals' portfolios. Investors also use their communication with peers and entrepreneurs via the ECF platform as a learning tool. On the entrepreneurs' side, ECF allows them to test their products, to develop their brand, to build a loyal customer base and to turn customers into investors. We conclude that policymakers, with the support of a locally appropriate regulatory framework, could support equity crowdfunding as one of the market choices available for entrepreneurs looking to start or grow their ventures.","[Estrin, Saul; Khavul, Susanna] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Whiteknights Reading, England; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Lucas Coll, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Sydney; University of Reading; California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University,"Estrin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk; daniel.gozman@gmail.com; susanna.khavul@sjsu.edu,"Gozman, Daniel/JDC-4259-2023; estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","Gozman, Daniel/0000-0002-7399-9201; estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",EU Horizon 2020 programme [649378]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EU Horizon 2020 programme(Horizon 2020); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the research assistance from Lolo Chen, Linde de Nie, Mary Fox, Ioanna Gouseti, Andrea Guerini-Rocco, Ines Steimelweger and Dustin Voss.

This paper considers endogenous cultural amenities as a location factor for high-skilled workers. To overcome selection in the provision of cultural amenities, we exploit variation in contemporaneous cultural amenities that is explained by the path-dependence of historical agglomerations of the cultural activities. To assess spillovers from high-skilled workers attracted by cultural amenities, we use a 1% sample drawn from the population of all West German workers under social security during the period 1975-2010. This panel of individual observations allows us to compare wages of similar individuals who work in locations with different levels of high-skilled workers who are attracted by cultural amenities. To account for non-random selection of workers among cities, we use individual-location fixed effects. Our results show that cultural amenities are an important factor in the location decision of high-skilled workers. The positive effect of the local share of high-skilled workers on unskilled, skilled and high-skilled wages indicates strong and productive spillovers.","[Falck, Oliver] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Falck, Oliver] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Munich, Germany; [Falck, Oliver; Heblich, Stephan] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Heblich, Stephan] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Heblich, Stephan] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Heblich, Stephan] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Otto, Anne] IAB Rheinland Pfalz Saarland, Eschberger Weg 68, D-66121 Saarbrucken, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); University of Bristol; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Heblich, S (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",falck@ifo.de; m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; stephan.heblich@bristol.ac.uk; anne.otto@iab.de,"Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021; Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182; Heblich, Stephan/0000-0001-6486-3727",ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,13,14,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Our analysis makes use of a new approach for calibrating the model to historical default rates that leads to more precise estimates of investment-grade default probabilities.","[Feldhutter, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Schaefer, Stephen M.] London Business Sch, London, England",Copenhagen Business School; University of London; London Business School,"Feldhütter, P (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",pf.fi@cbs.dk,"Schaefer, Stephen M/I-1605-2012","Feldhutter, Peter/0000-0002-0025-6159",Center for Financial Frictions (FRIC) [DNRF102],Center for Financial Frictions (FRIC),"We are grateful to the Q-Group for the Jack Treynor Prize.

Discrete Choice Experiment with duration (or DCETTO) is free of such bias, but respondents find this cognitively more challenging. This paper explores non-iterative TTO with or without lead time: NI(LT)TTO. In NI(LT)TTO, respondents see a series of independent pairwise choices without iteration (similar to DCETTO), but one of the two scenarios always involves full health for a shorter duration (similar to TTO). We compare three different types of NI(LT)TTO relative to DCETTO. Each type is presented in two modes: (a) verbally tabulated (as in a DCE) and (b) with visual aids (as in a TTO). The study has 8 survey variants, each with 12 experimental choice tasks and a 13th task with a logically determined answer. Data on the 12 experimental choices from an online survey of 6,618 respondents are modelled, by variant, using conditional logistic regressions. The results indicate that NI(LT)TTO is feasible, but some relatively mild states appear to have implausibly low predicted values, and the range of predicted values is much narrower than in DCETTO. The presentation of NI(LT)TTO tasks needs further improvement.","[Feng, Yan] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Hole, Arne Risa; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Karimi, Milad] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Karimi, Milad; Tsuchiya, Aki; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Sheffield,"Tsuchiya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",a.tsuchiya@sheffield.ac.uk,"Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; Hole, Arne Risa/JNE-2362-2023; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Van Hout, Ben/0000-0001-9698-6094; Karimi, Milad/0000-0002-5298-174X; Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126",EuroQol Research Foundation,EuroQol Research Foundation,"EuroQol Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 19 June 2015; EuroQol Research Foundation",,16,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27,8,,,,,1247,1263,,10.1002/hec.3773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3773,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29774632,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000437114300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using panel data over the period 1998-2008 and for 108 countries, it emerges that the effect of 'decentralization' (taken to be an increase in the number of government levels) broadly decreases both diesel and gasoline subsidies, with this effect being more pronounced when the level of political accountability is low. For developing countries, for which political accountability is low, decentralization decreases gasoline and diesel subsidies by at least 6.98% and 12.99%, respectively. For developed countries, for which political accountability is high, decentralization does not have any impact on both gasoline and diesel. What this evidence points to is that in developing economies, where voters are poorly informed and accountability is low, decentralization appears to be associated with lower fuel subsidies.

Preservation of these soils is in conflict with their current intensive use, as preservation would require restricting drainage. Due to spatial interdependencies of organic soil areas, rewetting these soils requires cooperation among farmers. Agglomeration payments are a potential option to foster such cooperation. In order to test the effectiveness of this policy approach, we developed a dynamic and framed economic experiment to represent the decision situation of farmers operating on organic soils in Switzerland. Our sample population are farm apprentices. Unlike previous experiments on agglomeration payments, our design allows for heterogeneity and dynamic changes in farmers' opportunity costs and for side payments between players. We compared the effects of constant vs. variable agglomeration payment schemes on the adoption of sustainable use of organic soils. The variable payment mirrors the evolution of farmers' opportunity costs over time. We find that while both policy options promote sustainable land use, the constant payment option performs best in terms of environmental effectiveness. The constant payment also yields lower inequality in income and is more cost-effective than the variable option. Furthermore, risk aversion and inequality aversion appear to influence behavior and reduce cooperation among players.","[Ferre, Marie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ferre, Marie] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Engel, Stefanie] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Environm Eco, Osnabruck, Germany; [Gsottbauer, Elisabeth] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Publ Finance, Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Leeds; University Osnabruck; University of Innsbruck,"Ferré, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.ferre@leeds.ac.uk,"Engel, Stefanie/B-6533-2009","Engel, Stefanie/0000-0002-3568-5500; Gsottbauer, Elisabeth/0000-0001-5849-8137","Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a National Research Program [406840-143145, NRP 68]; Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [406840_143145] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a National Research Program(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We acknowledge the support from the Swiss National Science Foundation, which funded this project (Sustainable management of organic soils in Switzerland, project number 406840-143145) as part of a National Research Program (NRP 68), and the Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation for complementary funding.

Through a narrative analysis, we identify historical policy changes leading to expansions or contractions in agency mortgage holdings. Based on those regulatory events that we classify as unrelated to short-run cyclical or credit market shocks, we find that an increase in mortgage purchases by the agencies boosts mortgage lending, in particular refinancing, and lowers mortgage rates. Agency purchases also influence prices in other asset markets, stimulate residential investment, and expand homeownership.

The relationship between the level of regional autonomy and the provision of local public services exhibits a u-shape: both low and high autonomy lead to better local public services.

A three-stage procedure is proposed to estimate the parameters. In a first stage, the spatial lag panel data model is estimated using an instrumental variable (IV) estimator. In a second stage, a generalized moments (GM) approach is developed to estimate the SMA parameter and the variance components of the disturbance process using IV residuals from the first stage. In a third stage, to purge the equation of the specific structure of the disturbances a Cochrane-Orcutt-type transformation is applied combined with the IV principle. This leads to the GM spatial IV estimator and the regression parameter estimates. Monte Carlo simulations show that our estimators are not very different in terms of root mean square error from those produced by maximum likelihood. The approach is applied to European Union regional employment data for regions nested within countries.","[Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Le Gallo, Julie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CESAER UMR1041, AgroSup Dijon, INRA, 26 Blvd Petitjean, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Pirotte, Alain] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of Cambridge; INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Fingleton, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",bf100@cam.ac.uk; julie.le-gallo@agrosupdijon.fr; alain.pirotte@u-paris2.fr,"Le Gallo, Julie/F-9167-2018; Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022","Le Gallo, Julie/0000-0002-7296-2415; Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X",ESRC [ES/L011921/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,10,10,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To address this issue we exploit a unique natural experiment in Britain: the closure of thousands of train stations, known as the Beeching Cuts, on the eve of General Election of 1964. We use several statistical methods to show that policy implementation was unaffected by partisan considerations and therefore it can be regarded as an exogenous intervention. An individual-level model of voting intentions from the first British Election Study conducted in 1963, and an aggregate model of party vote shares in the General Election of 1964 show that the closures significantly changed voting support for the Conservative party. The 1964 election was very competitive and the closures clearly contributed to the defeat of the incumbent government after.. years of uninterrupted rule.","[Flores, Alejandro Quiroz; Whiteley, Paul] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Flores, AQ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",aquiro@essex.ac.uk; whiteley@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We show that low past returns (losers) forecast future negative abnormal returns only among stocks with high leverage levels, but not among stocks with low leverage levels. However, high past returns (winners) forecast future positive abnormal returns independently of leverage level. As a result, the negative relation between leverage and future abnormal returns is only observed among loser stocks, and the positive relation between past returns and future abnormal returns is only shown among non-low leverage stocks. Our results are important in achieving better investment strategies: buying winners' stocks (independently of their level of leverage) and short-selling losers' stocks with high leverage yield higher abnormal returns than strategies based on only one of these variables. Our two-dimensional strategy yields risk-adjusted abnormal returns of 15.66% per annum, whereas the single leverage or momentum strategies yield 7.70% and 7.96% per annum, respectively. The difference is nearly 8% and economically significant. If leverage is considered as proxy for default risk, our results, contrary to previous evidence, show that momentum profits are not exclusive of default stocks, and that momentum returns are not only driven by negative returns yielded by distress stocks.","[Forner, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Muradoglu, Yaz Guelnur] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Sivaprasad, Sheeja] Univ Westminster, London, England",Universitat d'Alacant; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Westminster,"Forner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",carlos.forner@ua.es,"Muradoglu, Gulnur/HHM-5469-2022","Muradoglu, Gulnur/0000-0002-6392-6746; Sivaprasad, Sheeja/0000-0002-0112-5636; Forner, Carlos/0000-0002-0470-8802",,,,,50,3,3,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Based on considerations about wage costs and replacement costs, we discuss steep seniority wage profiles as incentives for firms to dismiss older workers before retirement. Conditional on individual retirement incentives, e.g., social security wealth accrual rates or health status, the steepness of the wage profile will have different incentives for workers as compared to firms to maintain the employment relationship. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for selection of workers in our firms and for reverse causality, we find that firms with higher labor costs for older workers have on average a lower job exit age and a higher incidence of golden handshakes.

This positive impact is stronger among individuals holding wage jobs at the time of re-entry compared to those that do not.

It offers opportunities for research application but also raises concerns over potentially negative consequences for academic research and its dissemination. For a sample of social, natural, and engineering science academics in Germany, and controlling for the selection into consulting, we investigate the effect of consulting with public and private sector organizations on research performance. While previous research suggested that consulting activities might come at the cost of reduced research output, our analysis provides a more nuanced picture. Public sector consulting comes with lower average citations, particularly for junior researchers. Moreover, engagement in consulting increases the probability to cease publishing research altogether, particularly for private sector consulting. The probability of exit from academic research increases with the intensity of consulting engagement for those at the start or towards the end of their academic career and in fields for which the public-private wage gap and opportunities for engagement in duties outside academia are higher. We draw lessons for research institutions and policy about the promotion of academic consulting.","[Fudickar, Roman; Hottenrott, Hanna] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Hottenrott, Hanna] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Hottenrott, Hanna] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Lawson, Cornelia] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Technical University of Munich; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); KU Leuven; University of Bath,"Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",roman.fudickar@tum.de; hanna.hottenrott@tum.de; c.lawson@bath.ac.uk,"Hottenrott, Hanna/AAE-7037-2021; Hottenrott, Hanna/H-4014-2018","Hottenrott, Hanna/0000-0002-1584-8106; Fudickar, Roman/0000-0001-9613-668X; Lawson, Cornelia/0000-0002-1262-5142",DFG [HO-5390/1-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank the ZEW for providing the survey data and particularly Maikel Pellens for his support.

The intensification of gendered divisions of paid and unpaid work after the birth of a child create unequal constraints and expectations such that, all else equal, mothers earn less than childless women, but fathers earn a wage premium. The fatherhood wage premium, however, varies substantially among men. Analyses of linked workplace-employee data from Canada reveal how organizational context conditions educational, occupational and family-status variation in fatherhood premiums. More formal employment relations (collective bargaining and human resource departments) reduce both overall fatherhood premiums and group differences in them, while performance pay systems (merit and incentive pay) have mixed effects. Shifting entrenched gendered divisions of household labour is thus not the only pathway to minimizing fathers' wage advantage.","[Fuller, Sylvia] Univ British Columbia, Sociol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Cooke, Lynn Prince] Univ Bath, Social Policy, Bath, Avon, England",University of British Columbia; University of Bath,"Fuller, S (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, 6303 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",sylvia.fuller@ubc.ca,,"Cooke, Lynn Prince/0000-0001-9307-9501",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [430-2014-00140]; European Research Council (ERC) under European Union [680958]; European Research Council (ERC) [680958] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); European Research Council (ERC) under European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Research was supported by Sylvia Fuller's funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC, grant no. 430-2014-00140).

Throttling the flow of merchandise through such places drove trade, and consequently economic growth, to those other places that enjoyed a convenient Legal Quay. In places without such quays, regulation and the farming of customs caused (and also facilitated) the suppression not only of international trade but also of domestic maritime trade. Though otherwise encouraged by Crown policy, entrepreneurial endeavour in Christchurch was stifled by customs regulation, in particular by the logistical burden introduced with remote record-keeping for coastal trade in the port books.

Informed managers outperform after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager's performance depends on the number of noise allocators.

Consistent with microevidence, fast-growing firms invest more in recruiting activities and achieve higher job-filling rates. These hiring decisions of firms aggregate into an index of economy-wide recruiting intensity. We study how aggregate shocks transmit to recruiting intensity, and whether this channel can account for the dynamics of aggregate matching efficiency during the Great Recession. Productivity and financial shocks lead to sizable procyclical fluctuations in matching efficiency through recruiting effort.

Descriptive analysis of the data indicates a cyclical nature of these defaults over a longer period. Regression results highlight the importance of the international monetary conditions as the volatilities of US treasury bills rates and USD-denominated LIBOR exert significant impacts on defaults. Political uncertainty increases the probability of default. Export (import) growth reduces (increases) the probability of default. Similarly, a 1% increase in inflation would increase the probability of defaults by 7%. Higher debt/GDP ratio is also linked to higher probability of default. A 1% increase in external debt would lead to a five to 7% increase in the probability of default. Higher GDP per capita reduces the probability of default. A previous banking crisis is linked to higher chances of sovereign defaults. Further analysis of entry into (out of) sovereign defaults indicates that higher US treasury rates would initiate sovereign defaults and would make it difficult for countries to come out of default. The same is true for central government debt/GDP, higher current account deficit and exchange rate volatility. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

More risk-averse agents can commit to larger transfers, as long as their consumption is less risky than their endowment. With sufficiently large idiosyncratic risk and sufficient discounting of the future, matching is positive assortative, unlike under full commitment.

In light of conflicting findings, this paper (i) reinvestigates the behavioral impact of so-called cognitive style in the PGG; and (ii) connects it with an earlier literature on the role of cognitive failure (confusion). This is motivated by the possibility that the method of time pressure, commonly used to identify cognitive style, invites confusion as a confounding factor. Two channels for such confounds are identified and experimentally tested: A heterogeneous treatment effect of time pressure depending on subjects' confusion status and a direct impact of time pressure on subjects' likelihood of being confused. Our reinvestigation of the behavioral impact of time pressure confirms that cognitive style matters, but that deliberation rather than intuition drives cooperation. The confounding effect of confusion is not found to be direct, but to operate through a heterogeneous treatment effect. Time pressure selectively reduces average contributions among those subjects whose contributions can confidently be interpreted as cooperative rather than confused. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To address both questions, we show it is crucial to account for consumer mileage heterogeneity. We use product-level data for a panel of European countries and exploit fuel cost variation by engine. Despite a modest undervaluation of fuel costs, fuel taxes are more effective in reducing fuel usage than product taxes. They also perform better in terms of welfare, even when usage demand is held fixed. The reason is that fuel taxes better target high mileage consumers to purchase fuel efficient cars.

Methods for obtaining such estimates include constant uptake estimates based on expert opinion or analogous technologies and on extrapolation from initial data points using parametric curves-but remain divorced from established diffusion theory and modeling. We propose an approach to obtaining diffusion estimates using experts' beliefs calibrated to an established diffusion model to address this methodologic gap. Methods: We performed an elicitation of experts' beliefs on future diffusion of a new preterm birth screening illustrative case study technology. The elicited quantities were chosen such that they could be calibrated to yield the parameters of the Bass model of new product growth, which was chosen based on a review of the diffusion literature. Results: With the elicitation of only three quantities per diffusion curve, our approach enabled us to quantify uncertainty about diffusion of the new technology in different scenarios. Pooled results showed that the attainable number of adoptions was predicted to be relatively low compared with what was thought possible. Further research evidence improved the attainable number of adoptions only slightly but resulted in greater speed of diffusion. Conclusions: The proposed approach of eliciting experts' beliefs about diffusion and informing the Bass model has the potential to fill the methodologic gap evident in value of implementation and research, as well as budget impact and some cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Grimm, Sabine E.] Maastricht Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Stevens, John W.; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Maastricht University; University of Sheffield,"Grimm, SE (通讯作者)，Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Oxford Bldg,P Debyelaan 25,POB 5800, NL-6202 AZ Maastricht, Netherlands.",sabine.grimm@mumc.nl,"Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/HSE-7402-2023","Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/0000-0002-2175-7999; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency","Financial support for this study was provided by a grant from the Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency.

Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component.

In the CRYSTAL study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal of consent. Objective To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness. Methods We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year (LY) and cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of patients with mCRC: all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT), tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS protein ('KRAS wt') and no detectable mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4 of NRAS ('RAS wt'). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio, and a cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts. Results The deterministic base-case ICER (cost per QALY gained) was A 130,929 pound in the ITT, A 72,053 pound in the KRAS wt and A 44,185 pound in the RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone. At a A 50,000 pound willingness-to-pay threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8, 20 and 63% probability of being cost-effective for the ITT, KRAS wt and RAS wt cohorts, respectively, versus FOLFIRI alone. Conclusion Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient selection.","[Harty, Gerard] Merck Serono Ltd, Stanwell Rd, Feltham TW14 8NX, Middx, England; [Jarrett, James] Mapi Grp Ltd, 73 Collier St, London N1 9BE, England; [Jofre-Bonet, Mireia] City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.; City University London,"Jofre-Bonet, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",mireia.jofre-bonet.1@city.ac.uk,"Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/V-8673-2019","Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0002-2055-2166; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0001-6168-0407",Merck KGaA,Merck KGaA(Merck & Company),This study was sponsored by Merck KGaA.,,41,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Simple examples are used to illustrate important exact properties of the estimator that follow from this representation. In general models a complete exact analysis is not possible, but a higher-order (saddlepoint) approximation is made available by the main result. We use this approximation to construct confidence intervals for the autoregressive parameter.

These are important in their own right, but they are especially notable because Cambridge heterodox economists have been devoted mainly to other approaches, including Marxism and post-Keynesianism.

The model suggests that large changes in the tax code may be easier to enact than marginal reforms. The tax base faces a tipping point where even the beneficiaries from tax exemptions support reform. At this tipping point, tax reform is Pareto improving. Politically feasible tax reform occurs when fiscal needs are large, but may nonetheless involve reductions in marginal tax rates. There is strategic complementarity in lobbying for tax exemptions, resulting in multiple equilibria. The model's main predictions are consistent with recent tax reforms in OECD countries.

This article explores such in the South African case. The article shows a precipitous growth in the magnitude of South African assets held and traded by international investors - increasingly institutional investors and other' financial institutions, such as hedge funds and complex investment vehicles. The composition of these assets, and the motivation for trading, has also altered, shifting towards a complex set of rand-denominated, short-term assets in equity, bond and derivatives markets traded for capital gains. Given this, the article contends that it is the portfolio considerations of such investors, rather than economic fundamentals', that have come to determine key economic prices, including the exchange rate, causing volatility, large swings and sudden adjustments. This, it is argued, places monetary policy in a predicament. In the context of liberalized capital accounts, together with the prioritization of inflation targeting, open-market interventions are ineffective at managing exchange rate movements and volatility, and often reinforce both the patterns of trading and subsequent vulnerabilities while carrying their own costs. In these respects, the nature of South Africa's global financial integrations has exposed it to new forms of external vulnerability, with both these developments, and associated monetary policies, deepening the financialization of the South African economy.","[Isaacs, Gilad] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Dept Econ, Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Witwatersrand; University of Leeds,"Isaacs, G (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa.",gilad.isaacs@wits.ac.za,,"Isaacs, Gilad/0000-0002-2419-9777",,,,,112,13,13,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

This question is addressed by analysing international co-movements of value added growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, region factors, sector factors, country factors, and idiosyncratic components. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods for 9 disaggregated sectors in 5 developed economies (G5) and 19 emerging economies for the 1972-2009 period. The results suggest that, while there exists a common 'regional business cycle' in the G5, fluctuations in sectoral value added growth are dominated by country-specific factors in the emerging markets. Despite that, the international factor (the sum of world and sector factors) is more important than the region factor, suggesting that the emerging markets are more synchronized with the G5. A simple regression shows that (i) the world factor would be more important the larger the share of agriculture in output; (ii) in more open economies the sector factor is more important in explaining sectoral value added growth fluctuations; (iii) the region factors is more important the richer and the less volatile the economy. Finally, a comparison of the variance of sectoral value added growth accounted for by each factor from the pre- to the post-globalization period shows convergence of the business cycles within the G5 and EM, respectively. The changes in the contribution of the world, sector and region factor are due to changes in the importance of those factors within sectors. However, for the emerging markets, the fall in the importance of the country factors is dominated by changes in the structural composition of the economies. Therefore, the evolution of the structural composition in the emerging markets could be an important driver for more synchronized business cycles at the regional and international level.

The paper argues that rather than the volume of non-financial corporations' financial investment, the composition of financial assets is crucial to assess corporate financialization in the country. Non-financial businesses in South Africa fundamentally transformed their investment behaviour during the 1990s, shifting from more productive uses such as trade credit towards highly liquid and potentially innovative (and therefore risky) financial investment. Following the direction of financial flows the article shows that companies' financial operations - fuelled by foreign capital inflows - are linked to the price inflation in South African property markets.","[Karwowski, Ewa] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Karwowski, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",E.Karwowski@herts.ac.uk,,"Karwowski, Ewa/0000-0001-6350-1839",,,,,104,15,15,3,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Consequently, the body of literature on NSTT is mature, while the body on SSTT and SNTT is still in its infancy. This paper provides a meta-synthesis of the scholarly writings on NSTT, SSTT and SNTT from the past 30 years. We specifically discuss core drivers and inhibitors of technology transfer and cooperation, outcomes as well as outcome determinants. We find policies and practices for low carbon development to be the main driver, both pushed by governments and international aid programs, as well as by firms that are interested in expanding overseas. Inhibitors include a non-existent market in the host countries and the abundance of cheap fossil fuel resources that price out renewables. The literature is divided on whether intellectual property rights are inhibitors or drivers of technology transfer to the Global South. Outcomes of technology transfer and cooperation are mixed with approximately one-third of instances reported as successful technology transfer and another one-third reported as failures. Core key success factors were identified as suitable government policies as well as adequate capacities in the recipient country. This analysis is then followed by an introduction of the papers of the special issue 'South-South Technology Transfer and Cooperation for Low Carbon Energy Technologies'. Finally, a research agenda for future work on NSTT, SSTT and SNTT is proposed.","[Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Urban, Frauke] Univ London, SOAS, London, England",Utrecht University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019",,ESRC [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,88,39,39,9,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119,,,,,,600,609,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.001,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000439671200056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given an initial international distribution of honest and dishonest taxpayers, the tax system (e.g., tax rates and degrees of progressivity) and the salary in each country, individuals decide where to reside and how much time to spend working. The model allows us to study in a dynamic setting how the distribution of honest and dishonest earners is geographically affected by fiscal reforms (e.g., variations in tax rates) and auditing efforts (e.g., probability of auditing and fines) of different countries. We show that various dynamic long term scenarios can be generated. The particular convergence of the model depends crucially on the initial geographic distribution of dishonest agents. This implies that tax reforms that have been successful in reducing tax evasion in one country may produce very different results in others, if initial conditions are significantly different. Chaotic cyclical behavior may also arise if individual propensity to migrate is sufficiently high.","[Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Pezzino, Mario] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Calabria; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Lamantia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, DESF, Via P Bucci 1-C, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",fabio.lamantia@unical.it,,"Pezzino, Mario/0000-0001-9620-7660; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979","E.U.

The German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) is unique in following both the flexible employee and their partner over time. The study utilizes this feature to investigate whether the take-up of work hour flexibility is detrimental for the flexible employee's wage development. Men and women benefit from flexible working hours. For women, this positive wage effect occurs late, suggesting that, unlike men, they must first prove their commitment. Moreover, it tests for the first time whether flexible workers' partners profit from the increased couple-level flexibility. The positive cross-partner effect for the inflexible partner is particularly pronounced for mothers' wages, suggesting that men may use flexible working hours to support their wives' careers. These measures are not necessarily used more frequently by those in need (e.g. parents or women). Instead, they seem to be accessed by those in sought-after positions.","[Langner, Laura Antonia] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Langner, Laura Antonia] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Langner, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.;Langner, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",laura.langner@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/ N001575/1, ES/L011662/1]; Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft; ERC [339703]; ESRC [ES/L011662/1, ES/N001575/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [339703] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant numbers ES/ N001575/1, ES/L011662/1], the Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft and the ERC [339703].",,43,24,25,9,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Missing data are, however, a common issue that can seriously undermine their validity. A major concern is that the chance of data being missing may be directly linked to the unobserved value itself [missing not at random (MNAR)]. For example, patients with poorer health may be less likely to complete quality-of-life questionnaires. However, the extent to which this occurs cannot be ascertained from the data at hand. Guidelines recommend conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of conclusions to plausible MNAR assumptions, but this is rarely done in practice, possibly because of a lack of practical guidance. This tutorial aims to address this by presenting an accessible framework and practical guidance for conducting sensitivity analysis for MNAR data in trial-based CEA. We review some of the methods for conducting sensitivity analysis, but focus on one particularly accessible approach, where the data are multiply-imputed and then modified to reflect plausible MNAR scenarios. We illustrate the implementation of this approach on a weight-loss trial, providing the software code. We then explore further issues around its use in practice.","[Leurent, Baptiste; Carpenter, James R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Gomes, Manuel; Morris, Stephen] UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, London, England; [Faria, Rita] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Grieve, Richard] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Carpenter, James R.] UCL, MRC, Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; University College London; University of York - UK; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London,"Leurent, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",baptiste.leurent@lshtm.ac.uk,"Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; Morris, Stephen/0000-0002-5828-3563; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566; Gomes, Manuel/0000-0002-1428-1232; Grieve, Richard/0000-0001-8899-1301; Carpenter, James/0000-0003-3890-6206; Leurent, Baptiste/0000-0001-6420-6567","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-12437, SRF-2013-06-016]; NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust; Medical Research Council (MRC) [MC_UU_12023/21]; MRC [MC_UU_12023/21] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust; Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This report is independent research supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (Doctoral Research Fellowship, B.

Methodological populism in the Bangladesh health and education sectors,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Participation; Policy process; Populism; Ethnography; Development management; Bangladesh; Health; Education,,"Policy makers are frequently characterized as being out of touch with the communities they serve. But closing the gap between policy makers and people is not straightforward, since distancing effects are produced by a combination of geography, politics and knowledge. This article analyses the case of an experimental initiative in Bangladesh known as the reality check that attempted to influence policy makers in the health and education sectors by providing them with people-centered data gathered at community level. The case is analyzed as an example of methodological populism that combined participatory and ethnographic approaches, and as one that challenged current managerialist cultures of what can be considered as acceptable evidence for policy. The case highlights tensions between participation, populism and policy that are potentially productive but constrained by three sets of factors: (i) contestations over the status of popular knowledge, (ii) the need for critical policy spaces within policy processes in which policy makers can engage with such knowledge, and (iii) the disruptive temporalities within policy processes that tend to inhibit learning. Drawing on the guarded hopefulness of meta-modernist theory, the paper concludes that if more attention can be paid to such issues, initiatives informed by methodological populism such as the reality check could be further built upon in ways that may contribute to the humanization or peopling of policy processes.

Normatively, decision makers should be sensitive to inflation rates when evaluating delayed rewards because the value of a delayed outcome is eroded by inflation. We hypothesised that participants from countries with direct experience of high inflation would be particularly sensitive to inflation rates when making intertemporal choices; i.e. they may be more likely to take into consideration the effect of inflation on future rewards. This study compares intertemporal choices of participants from countries with dramatically different histories of inflation: Argentina and Britain. Participants completed a delay discounting task under two inflation rate conditions (2% and 20%, between subjects). We found that people discounted future rewards more steeply under the 20% inflation rate condition than under the 2% condition. Participants from Argentina, the country with much higher current and historical inflation rates, discounted future rewards more steeply in both inflation rate conditions than participants from the UK. However, Argentines were not more sensitive to inflation rates than British people.","[Macchia, Lucia; Plagnol, Anke C.; Reimers, Stian] City Univ London, Dept Psychol, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Macchia, L (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Psychol, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",lucia.macchia@city.ac.uk,"Macchia, Lucía/IUN-0194-2023; Reimers, Stian/A-9512-2008; Plagnol, Anke/N-1477-2019; Macchia, Lucía/AAH-4846-2021","Macchia, Lucía/0000-0001-9558-4747; Plagnol, Anke/0000-0001-5705-8949; Macchia, Lucía/0000-0001-9558-4747; Reimers, Stian/0000-0002-9497-0942",,,,,43,5,6,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We find that coroporate social responsibility (CSR) investments are higher under FDI than under exports. The multinational firm's incentives to serve the foreign country through FDI are increasing in the average consumer's valuation for CSR and in the intensity of the foreign country's market competition, but only if the average consumer's valuation for CSR in this country is sufficiently high. These incentives are mitigated by the multinational firm's liability in this country under exports. We also find that there is misalignment of preferences between the stakeholders of the two countries over the multinational firm's mode of entry in the foreign country.","[Manasakis, Constantine] Univ Crete, Dept Polit Sci, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece; [Manasakis, Constantine] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Manasakis, Constantine] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Hellas, Greece; [Mitrokostas, Evangelos] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Petrakis, Emmanuel] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece",University of Crete; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; University of Portsmouth; University of Crete,"Manasakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Sch Social Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Gallos Campus, GR-74100 Rethimnon, Crete, Greece.",manasakis@uoc.gr,"petrakis, emmanuel/M-9330-2015; Manasakis, Constantine/AAL-7788-2021","petrakis, emmanuel/0000-0003-1273-8099; Manasakis, Constantine/0000-0002-0306-4005","EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020: COST Action The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation [IS1104]; University of Crete, Special Account for Research","EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020: COST Action The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation; University of Crete, Special Account for Research","EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020: COST Action IS1104 The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation, and University of Crete, Special Account for Research.",,28,13,13,8,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Moderate voters have preferences over the vote shares received by the parties so that an agent's optimal voting decision might depend on the other agents' behavior. A voter's information about other voters' behavior can be improved through a series of opinion polls. We show that the mass of undecided voters decreases monotonically with the number of polls, but may not necessarily disappear. Voters who remain undecided have centrist ideologies. On average a series of polls brings the society closer to complete information even though specific polls may push the election result away from the complete information case.","[Mavridis, Christos] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Ortuno-Ortin, Ignacio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Lancaster University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Mavridis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",c.mavridis@lancaster.ac.uk; iortuno@eco.uc3m.es,"; ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/Y-5541-2018","MAVRIDIS, CHRISTOS/0000-0002-1146-958X; ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/0000-0001-6721-5901","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2016-75992-P, MDM2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM(Comunidad de Madrid)","We would like to especially thank Antoine Loeper for his comments.

If the composition of the balance sheet is unrestricted then the path of inflation is indeterminate. This is the case under pure quantitative easing, where the target is the size of real money balances. In contrast, credit easing policies restrict the composition of the portfolio by targeting a specific expansion in the maturity profile of bonds bought, and thus can implement a determinate path of inflation.

Considering widening disparities on what constitutes sufficient energy (electricity) access between the global north (North America, Europe, Australia) and the global south (sub-Saharan Africa, SSA), this paper highlights the influence of 'western reality' on the energy narrative. This paper also attempts to propose a model that evaluates off-grid electrification projects (in the global south) and their ability to guarantee sufficientarianism by examining the prospects of such projects in providing connected households access (energy security and sustainability of energy supply) and mobility (transition from a lower to higher energy level through the purchase of additional electrical equipment). Furthermore, this paper explores and provides arguments on energy bullying (by industrialized nations on developing countries mostly in SSA) while also offering suggestions for improvements in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. In essence, this paper formulates the endemic problems of energy access and energy mobility (plaguing the global south) as a justice problem and further provides insight into the exacerbation of injustice and bullying exhibited by the global north.

It uses an unbalanced panel of 300 microfinance institutions (MFIs) from 107 developing countries from 2005 to 2015. Three key trends emerge from the results of a 2SLS regression. First, the adoption of formal microbanking practices raises interest rates compared with other forms of microlending. Second, large-scale lending lowers interest rates only for those MFIs that already hold legal banking status. Third, age of operation in excess of 8 years exerts a negative impact on interest rates, regardless of scale and charter type of MFI. Collectively, our results indicate that policies that incentivize mature MFIs to share their knowledge will be more effective in helping the nascent institutions to overcome their cost disadvantages compared with reforms to transform them into licensed banks. For MFIs that already hold permits to operate as banks, initiatives to increase loan sizes are key strategic pricing decisions, irrespective of the institution's age. This study is original in its differentiation of the impact on interest rates of regulations that promote formal banking principles, credit market extension vis-a-vis knowledge sharing between mature and nascent MFIs.","[Nwachukwu, Jacinta C.; Aziz, Aqsa; Tony-Okeke, Uchenna] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon",Coventry University; African Governance & Development Institute,"Nwachukwu, JC (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.",jacinta.nwachukwu@coventry.ac.uk,"Tony-Okeke, Uchenna/AAU-6850-2020; Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135; Aziz, Aqsa/0000-0001-7311-3979",,,,,43,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Our aim is to inform building managers, environmental consultants, and social scientists on the effectiveness of low-cost, easy-to-implement interventions aimed at reducing energy waste and carbon emissions in a setting where individuals do not have direct financial gain and have low awareness of the environmental impact of their actions. The interventions consist of three types of emails with different information content aimed at encouraging recipients not to leave the windows of their office open overnight or during weekends. Our results show that these interventions are effective in promoting energy savings, as the percentage of windows left open by treated occupants is typically halved compared to a control group. We find that the impact of the treatment is stronger when we provide specific information about the energy waste of the building where the email recipients work or when we show them how their behaviour differs from that of their peers. Moreover, our results show that positive behavioural changes are still observed a few weeks after the interventions are terminated, thus suggesting that such interventions do not act only as temporary cues which are easily forgotten by recipients.

This paper focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a phase II, industry-sponsored, single-arm, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative study. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment (in terms of major cytogenetic response and major haematological response) with an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML. Given the absence of any head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other relevant comparators, the company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of ponatinib with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with CP-CML because comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to allow the matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC approach, ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or BP-CML, which were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore the uncertainty in the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the uncertainty in the decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, from A 18,246 pound to A 27,667 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with best supportive care (BSC), from A 19,680 pound to A 37,381 pound per QALY gained compared with bosutinib and from A 18,279 pound per QALY gained to dominated compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). In AP-CML, the cost per QALY gained for ponatinib ranged from A 7123 pound to A 17,625 pound compared with BSC, and from dominating to A 61,896 pound per QALY gained compared with allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from A 5033 pound per QALY gained to dominated compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more favourable end of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the Patient Access Scheme.","[Pandor, Abdullah; Stevenson, Matt; Stevens, John; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Hamilton, Jean; Rawdin, Andrew; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Byrne, Jenny] Nottingham City Hosp, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Rudin, Claudius] Royal Devon & Exeter Hosp, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England",University of Sheffield; Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; Nottingham City Hospital; University of Exeter,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Byrne, Jenny/0000-0002-9381-1851",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/51/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project number 16/51/11).

Understanding the impact of non-adherence on costs is essential to the assessment of the cost effectiveness of interventions in which adherence to treatment is a concern. Objectives We undertook a comprehensive review of the available literature on the impact on costs of non-adherence to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods We performed a search on multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Health Management Information Consortium) for any study reporting the impact of adherence to antipsychotics on costs in patients with schizophrenia up to February 2018. We included trials of behavioural interventions but excluded comparisons of different pharmacological therapies. Studies were included if at least one-third of the study population had schizophrenia and costs were reported. Results Thirty-four publications on 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies reported analyses of administrative databases, primarily Medicaid. Findings on healthcare costs were mixed but suggested that lower pharmacy costs in non-adherent patients may outweigh increased hospitalisation costs where drug costs are relatively high. A few studies published analysis of prospective cohort data, or trials of behavioural interventions intended to influence adherence, mainly in a European setting. Findings were again mixed but indicate that increasing adherence does not reduce overall costs. Conclusions Inference from analysis of administrative data is limited by the risk of selection bias. Inference from trials is limited by small sample sizes. The literature does not consistently support an assumption that non-adherence increases healthcare costs.","[Pennington, Mark; McCrone, Paul] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, Kings Hlth Econ, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London,"Pennington, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, Kings Hlth Econ, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",mark.w.pennington@kcl.ac.uk,"Pennington, Mark/AAS-9946-2020","Pennington, Mark/0000-0002-1392-8700; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502",Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,"This study was funded by Janssen-Cilag Ltd.

Bubble implosion may take several different forms depending on the nature of the collapse and therefore requires some flexibility in modeling. This paper first strengthens the theoretical foundation of the real time bubble monitoring strategy proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a, b, PSY) by developing analytics and studying the performance characteristics of the testing algorithm under alternative forms of bubble implosion which capture various return paths to market normalcy. Second, we propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating estimators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications arising from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effects present in the reverse regression. A real-time version of the strategy is provided that is suited for practical implementation. Simulations explore the finite sample performance of the strategy for dating market recovery. The use of the PSY strategy for bubble monitoring and the new procedure for crisis detection are illustrated with an application to the Nasdaq stock market.","[Phillips, Peter C.

As in Meltzer and Richard (J Polit Econ 89:914-927, 1981), income taxes increase with inequality. Conversely, expenditure taxes first increase and then decrease with increasing inequality. The extent to which taxes are levied on income relative to expenditure unambiguously rises with inequality. In contrast to government size evidence, cross-country data exhibit a robust positive correlation between the extent to which taxes are levied on income relative to expenditure and inequality.

With this opportunity, participants have to make strategic economic decisions despite limited formal expertise and information. Decentralization (using digital technologies) and reputation (using user reviews) are the core mechanisms chosen by these platforms to mitigate these limitations and to work efficiently as online matchmakers. We test the performance of these two mechanisms by studying the allocative efficiency (in terms of value and volume of transactions) of simulated marketplaces under different types of motivation from the participants and control from the platforms. As a result, we find an inverted-U relationship between the decision-making leeway available to the participants and the platform's allocative efficiency. From the participants' perspectives, too much freedom or too many barriers lead to market failures affecting specific participants: low-end consumers are banned from the marketplace while high-end providers experience lower levels of activity. As governance advice for these platforms, we show the limitations of promoting these platforms on the sole motive of monetary rewards.","[Querbes, Adrien] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Denmark Rd Bldg,Denmark Rd, Manchester M13 9NA, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Querbes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Denmark Rd Bldg,Denmark Rd, Manchester M13 9NA, Lancs, England.",adrien.querbes@manchester.ac.uk,"Querbes, Adrien/JQI-9929-2023","Querbes, Adrien/0000-0001-9521-4033",,,,,68,20,24,0,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Research was conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh, regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced poverty traps. Findings also reveal that interventions from external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability for many households.","[Rahman, H.

In a large online sample, we replicate the seminal finding that cheating rates are largely insensitive to stake size, even at a 500-fold increase. We present two new findings. First, resisting the temptation to cheat at high stakes led to negative moral spill-over, triggering a moral license: participants who resisted cheating in the high stakes condition subsequently donated a smaller fraction of their earnings to charity. Second, participants who cheated maximally mispredicted their perceived morality: although such participants thought they were less prone to feeling immoral if they cheated, they ended up feeling more immoral a day after the cheating task than immediately afterwards. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings on moral balancing and self-deception, and the practical relevance for organisational design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ixekizumab was compared with tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab), ustekinumab, secukinumab, best supportive care and, if non-biological treatment or phototherapy is suitable, also compared with systemic non-biological therapies and phototherapy with ultraviolet B radiation for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents a summary of the company submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the development of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee. The Evidence Review Group produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of ixekizumab based on the company submission. The company submission presented three randomised controlled trials identified in a systematic review. All randomised controlled trials were phase III, multicentre placebo-controlled trials including 3866 participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Two trials also included an active comparator (etanercept). All randomised controlled trials showed statistically significant increases in two primary outcomes, static Physician Global Assessment (0,1) and improvement of 75% from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Ixekizumab was generally well tolerated in the randomised controlled trials, with similar discontinuation rates because of adverse events as placebo or etanercept. The most frequent adverse events of special interest were infections and injection-site reactions. The company submission also included a network meta-analysis of relevant comparators. The Evidence Review Group highlighted some issues regarding the systematic review process and an issue with the generalisability of the findings in that the trials failed to include patients with moderate psoriasis according to a widely used definition. This issue was considered by the Appraisal Committee and the population was deemed generalisable to patients in England and Wales. Based on the network meta-analysis, the Appraisal Committee concluded that ixekizumab was more clinically effective than adalimumab and ustekinumab, and agreed it was likely that ixekizumab was similarly effective compared with secukinumab and infliximab while tolerability was similar to other biological treatments approved for treating psoriasis. The Evidence Review Group's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (1) the use of relative outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response to model the cost effectiveness; (2) the exclusion of the consequences of adverse events; (3) the assumption of no utility gain in the induction phase; (4) equal annual discontinuation rates for all treatments; (5) the selection of treatment sequences for consideration in the analyses and; (6) the transparency of the Visual Basic for Applications code used to develop the model. Although some of these issues were adjusted in the Evidence Review Group base case, the Evidence Review Group could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. In the Evidence Review Group base-case incremental analysis, the treatment sequence incorporating ixekizumab in the second line has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 25,532 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. the etanercept sequence. Ixekizumab in the first-line sequence has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 39,129 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with the treatment sequence incorporating ixekizumab in the second line. Consistent with its conclusion regarding clinical effectiveness, the Appraisal Committee concluded that the cost effectiveness of ixekizumab for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis was similar to that of other biological treatments, already recommended in previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. The committee concluded that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was within the range that could be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

We implement a nonparametric estimation method for both the tail and quantile dependence parameters on weekly data over the period 1989-2016 using copula. Our results suggest that the contagion effects between stock and currency markets are limited, even under extreme fluctuations. We also find a weak comovement between currency and bond markets, however, evidence of asymmetry is found in the dependence structure, possibly due to the 'risk-reward' scenario of international investors. Finally, our results indicate a weak dependence between stock returns and bond yields, possibly due to the low-yielding gilt and the thirst for income, pushing investors to diversify globally into other financial markets.

The objective of this paper was to compare the predictive ability of univariate and bivariate models, in terms of forecasting US gross national product (GNP) growth at different forecasting horizons, with the bivariate models containing information on a measure of economic uncertainty. Based on point and density forecast accuracy measures, as well as on equal predictive ability (EPA) and superior predictive ability (SPA) tests, we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of different model specifications over the quarterly period of 1919:Q2 until 2014:Q4. We find that the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index should improve the accuracy of US GNP growth forecasts in bivariate models. We also find that the EPU exhibits similar forecasting ability to the term spread and outperforms other uncertainty measures such as the volatility index and geopolitical risk in predicting US recessions. While the Markov switching time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model yields the lowest values for the root mean squared error in most cases, we observe relatively low values for the log predictive density score, when using the Bayesian vector regression model with stochastic volatility. More importantly, our results highlight the importance of uncertainty in forecasting US GNP growth rates.","[Segnon, Mawuli] Univ Munster, Ctr Quantitat Econ, Munster, Germany; [Segnon, Mawuli] Mark E AG, Hagen, Germany; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska Omaha, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Munster; University of Pretoria; European University Institute; IPAG Business School; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Omaha; Loughborough University,"Segnon, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Quantitat Econ, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",segnon@uni-muenster.de,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,67,19,19,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Objective Our purpose was to review the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for both currently vaccine-eligible and non-eligible individuals, particularly the men-who-have-sex-with-men population, and synthesize the available evidence. Methods We systematically searched for published articles in two main databases (PubMed and EMBASE). Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using a validated instrument (Bias in Economic Evaluation, ECOBIAS). Methodological aspects, study results, and sensitivity analyses were extracted and synthesized to generate a consistent overview of the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in the men-who-have-sex-with-men population. Results From 770 identified articles, four met the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, human papillomavirus vaccination showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to US$96,146 and US$14,000 to US$18,200 for tertiary prevention and primary prevention, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio seemed most sensitive to vaccine efficacy, vaccine costs, and the incidence of anal cancer in the selected target populations. Conclusion This review presents the human papillomavirus vaccine, both as a primary and adjuvant (tertiary) vaccination, as a potentially cost-effective strategy for preventing mainly-but not limited to only-anal cancer in men-who-have-sex-with-men populations.","[Setiawan, Didik; Wondimu, Abrham; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Antonius Deusinglaan 1,Bldg 3214, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Setiawan, Didik] Univ Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Fac Pharm, Purwokerto, Indonesia; [Wondimu, Abrham; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ong, KohJun] Publ Hlth England, Natl Infect Serv, Ctr Infect Dis Surveillance & Control, London, England; [van Hoek, Albert Jan] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Universitas Muhammadiyah Purwokerto; University of Groningen; Public Health England; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Groningen,"Wondimu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Antonius Deusinglaan 1,Bldg 3214, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.;Wondimu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.",d.didiksetiawan@gmail.com; leabrham@gmail.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Setiawan, Didik/0000-0001-9104-548X","University of Groningen; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia","University of Groningen; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia","These findings are the result of work supported by the University of Groningen and Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia.

In this endeavour, we employ the novel SOR (Shahbaz et al. 2017) unit root test on French time series data over the period 1955-2016 to examine the order of integration in the presence of sharp and smooth structural breaks in the variables. We also apply the bootstrapping bounds testing approach, recently developed by McNown et al. (2018), to investigate the presence of cointegration and the empirical findings underscore the presence of cointegration among the time series. Moreover, we find that FDI has a positive impact, while energy research innovations have a negative impact, on French carbon emissions. Financial development lowers carbon emissions, thereby improving the French environmental quality. FDI degrades the environment, and thus supports the pollution-haven hypothesis in France. Similarly, financial development suggests that financial stability is a required condition for improving environmental quality, so are energy research innovations. Contrarily, energy consumption is positively linked with carbon emissions. However, the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is an inverted-U, which is a validation of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The principal contribution of this paper is therefore to analyse energy demand for European industries over the period 1995-2009 using a dynamic multilevel model that accounts for this hierarchical data structure. Among other things, we find, firstly, that our dynamic multilevel model suggests that if industry income and the industry energy price increase by 10%, long run energy demand will increase by 8.1% and fall by 6.8%, respectively. Secondly, we find that the corresponding long run income and price elasticities are substantially larger in a standard dynamic model of industry level energy demand which does not account for the hierarchical data structure. Our results therefore suggest that not accounting for the hierarchical data structure results in unreliable estimates of energy demand elasticities. From a policy perspective we argue that it is imperative that future industry level energy demand studies account for the hierarchical structure of the data. This is to prevent energy policy making being based on industry level evidence that substantially inflates the responsiveness of long run energy demand to income and price changes.

Symptoms include bone pain, joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Published evidence regarding the patient experience of XLH is sparse and no XLH-specific outcome measures have been validated. Objectives: To understand the symptoms, impacts, and patient experience of XLH and to evaluate the face and content validity of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC (R)) and the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) for use as end points in XLH clinical trials. Methods: Face-to-face, qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 adults with XLH in the United States using concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing techniques. Openended questioning elicited spontaneous concepts focusing on XLH-associated symptoms and functional limitations. Cognitive debriefing of the WOMAC (R) and BPI-SF assessed the relevance and patient understanding of item wording, recall period, and response options. Results: Various distinct symptom concepts were elicited including pain symptoms, dental symptoms, sensory symptoms, tiredness/ fatigue symptoms, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Participants reported experiencing significant bone and joint pain, stiffness, mobility limitations, and an impact on their ability to work. Cognitive interviewing found both instruments to be relevant and well understood by most patients. Conclusions: The interviews generated rich, qualitative insights into the patient experience of XLH. Cognitive debriefing of the BPI-SF and WOMAC (R) supported their value as XLH clinical trial end points. Future research will assess the psychometric properties of these instruments for use in the XLH population.","[Theodore-Oklota, Christina; Chen, Chao-Yin; Skrinar, Alison] Ultragenyx Pharmaceut, Novato, CA USA; [Bonner, Nicola; Spencer, Holly; Arbuckle, Rob] Adelphi Values, Bollington, Cheshire, England",Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.; Adelphi Group Ltd,"Bonner, N (通讯作者)，Adelphi Mill, Adelphis, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",nicola.bonner@adelphiavalues.com,,,"Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","This project was funded by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA), which commissioned Adelphi Values (Bollington, Cheshire, UK).",,28,20,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,AUG,2018,21,8,,,,,973,983,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.013,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GP7IX,30098676,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000441071700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

These similar characteristics enable peer organizations to benchmark performance once their operational data are normalized for differences in scale of operations. The most commonly used normalization factors for the demand side output are passenger boardings and passenger kilometres. For the supply side output these are vehicle kilometres and vehicle hours. Through twelve years of experience in the International Bus Benchmarking Group (IBBG) a better understanding of differences in service characteristics between 'similar' peers has been achieved, which highlight a challenge for the interpretation of normalized performance. It became clear that relative performance should often not be concluded from performance indicators normalized in a single dimension. Variety between peers in commercial speed, trip length, vehicle planning capacity, vehicle weight and network efficiency result in the need for a bi-dimensional or balanced approach to data normalization. This paper quantifies the variety within these operational characteristics and provides examples of the interpretation bias this may lead to. A framework is provided for use by bus organization management, policymakers and benchmarking practitioners that suggests applicable combinations of denominators for a balanced normalization process, leading to improved understanding of relative performance.","[Trompet, Mark; Anderson, Richard J.; Graham, Daniel J.] Imperial Coll London, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; University of London; University College London,"Trompet, M (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.trompet@imperial.ac.uk; richard.anderson@imperial.ac.uk; d.j.graham@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Trompet, Mark/O-5002-2018","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Trompet, Mark/0000-0002-3231-8617",,,,,22,7,7,2,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected Memokath-051 for evaluation. The company, PNN Medical, claimed Memokath-051 has clinical superiority and cost savings compared with double-J stents. It identified five studies reporting clinical evidence on Memokath-051 and constructed a de novo cost model comparing Memokath-051 to double-J stents. Results indicated that Memokath-051 generated cost savings of A 4156 pound per patient over 2.5 years. The External Assessment Centre (EAC) critiqued the company's submission and completed substantial additional work. Sixteen studies were identified assessing Memokath-051 and all listed comparators in the scope (double-J stents, reconstructive surgery and metallic and alloy stents) except nephrostomy. Similar success rates were reported for Memokath-051 compared with double-J and Resonance stents and worse outcomes compared with other options with evidence available. The EAC updated the company's cost model structure and modified several inputs. The EAC's model estimated that Memokath-051 generated savings of at least A 1619 pound per patient over 5 years compared with double-J stents, was cost neutral compared with other metallic stents and was cost saving compared with surgery up to month 55. Overall, Memokath-051 is likely to be cost saving in patients not indicated for reconstructive surgery and those expected to require a ureteral stent for at least 30 months. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee (MTAC) reviewed the evidence and supported the case for adoption, issuing partially supportive recommendations published after public consultation as Medical Technologies Guidance 35.","[Turner, Emily Eaton; Jenks, Michelle; McCool, Rachael; Marshall, Chris; Wood, Hannah; Peel, Alison; Craig, Joyce] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Millar, Liesl] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Level 1A,City Tower,Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BT, Lancs, England; [Sims, Andrew J.] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Freeman Hosp, Freeman Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7DN, Tyne & Wear, England; [Sims, Andrew J.] Newcastle Univ, Fac Med Sci, Inst Cellular Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of York - UK; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; Newcastle Freeman Hospital; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Newcastle University - UK,"Turner, EE (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",emily.eatonturner@york.ac.uk,"Sims, Andrew/AAT-8027-2021","Sims, Andrew/0000-0002-9553-7278; Gildea, Liesl/0000-0001-7249-102X",NICE to act as an EAC for the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme,NICE to act as an EAC for the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme,Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and York Health Economics Consortium are funded by NICE to act as an EAC for the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme.,,37,5,5,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This extends to a special 'Automotive Sector Deal' that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every 1million pound of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries. The comparable figure for GDP is 42%.","[Turner, Karen; Alabi, Oluwafisayo] Univ Strathclyde, Int Publ Policy Inst, Ctr Energy, McCance Bldg,16 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Smith, Martin; Irvine, John] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews Ctr Adv Mat, Sch Chem, Purdie Bldg, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland; [Dodds, Paul E.] UCL, Fac Built Environm, Bartlett Sch Environm Energy & Resources, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Strathclyde; University of St Andrews; University of London; University College London,"Turner, K (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Int Publ Policy Inst, Ctr Energy, McCance Bldg,16 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",karen.turner@strath.ac.uk,"Dodds, Paul/AAA-3294-2022; Irvine, John TS/F-1283-2011","Dodds, Paul/0000-0003-1476-1137; Irvine, John/0000-0002-8394-3359","EPSRC Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Hub research programme [EP/J016454/1]; EPSRC [EP/J016454/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Hub research programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The work reported here is a result of the EPSRC Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Hub research programme (Grant ref.

These effects are driven by a behavioral change among these policemen. We find no evidence of favoritism within the police.

In equilibrium, there is a negative relationship between the age and perceived quality of women on the marriage market and, consistent with available evidence, older brides make higher net marriage payments. The model also implies path dependence in the evolution of adolescent marriage practices over time and persistent effects on marriage practices from transitory shocks.

Once we allow for course selectivity in our analysis we find that our estimates of the effects of attending the most prestigious HEIs is around 10 percentage points lower than otherwise; the effects of attending the middle ranking HEIs is around 5 percentage points lower; and that of attending these lowest ranking HEIs is unaffected.

This article explores trends in part-time job quality for women up to and beyond the recession of 2008/9, and asks whether post-recessionary job quality remains differentiated by occupational class. A pre-recessionary narrowing of the part-time/full-time gap in job quality appears to have been maintained for the women in higher-level part-time jobs, while part- and full-timers in lower-level jobs suffered the worst effects of the recession, signalling deepening occupational class inequalities among working women.","[Warren, Tracey] Univ Nottingham, Sociol, Nottingham, England; [Lyonette, Clare] Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Nottingham; University of Warwick,"Warren, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",tracey.warren@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Warren, Tracey/0000-0002-1485-4969",,,,,59,34,36,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, as an effect of the used choice models, conventional applications of SUE are based on the assumption that all available routes have a positive probability of being chosen, however unattractive. In this paper, a novel choice model, the Bounded Choice Model (BCM), is presented along with network conditions for a corresponding Bounded SUE. The model integrates an exogenously-defined bound on the random utility of the set of paths that are used at equilibrium, within a Random Utility Theory (RUT) framework. The model predicts which routes are used and unused (the choice sets are equilibrated), while still ensuring that the distribution of flows on used routes accords to a Discrete Choice Model. Importantly, conditions to guarantee existence and uniqueness of the Bounded SUE are shown. Also, a corresponding solution algorithm is proposed and numerical results are reported by applying this to the Sioux Falls network. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A medical device has been developed to prevent the occurrence of DFU. The aim of this study was to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) for this device among the general public in the UK. A contingent valuation survey was administered to 1051 participants through an online survey including questions on socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported health, knowledge of diabetes and medical devices, and WTP. A two-part model was used to analyse determinants of WTP, including a logistic model in the first part and a generalised linear model with a log-transformed WTP in the second part. More than half (55.9%) of the participants expressed a positive WTP. The annual mean (standard deviation) and median (interquartile range) WTP values were A 76.9 pound (69.1) and A 50 pound (80), respectively. Older age, middle-level education, good/excellent self-reported health, visiting doctors once/2-5 times, diabetes experience, medical device experience and more than average self-perceived likelihood of using similar devices were associated with a higher likelihood of willingness to pay. Younger age, male gender and higher household income were associated with higher WTP values. This study demonstrated that people are willing to pay for this device and they tend to contribute when they have experience of diabetes or similar devices and perceive self-benefit.","[Yang, Fan] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Gannon, Brenda] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Weightman, Andrew] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of York - UK; University of Queensland; University of Manchester,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",fan.bella.yang@york.ac.uk,"Weightman, Andrew/G-9706-2015; Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017","Weightman, Andrew/0000-0001-7232-4942; Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030; Yang, Fan/0000-0003-4689-265X",University of Manchester Research Institute,University of Manchester Research Institute,"This study was funded by the University of Manchester Research Institute.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the trade-off between scheduling efficiency and the airlines' dis-utility of slot schedules expressed by various metrics of schedule displacement. We develop and solve two bi-objective scheduling models considering different combinations of total and maximum acceptable slot displacement objectives. The proposed models are applied to real-world scheduling data. Substantial improvements in schedule acceptability metrics are achieved without sacrificing a lot in terms of scheduling efficiency. Sacrifices in scheduling efficiency increase the capability of the airport coordinator to allocate slots that are eventually acceptable and hence more intensively used.","[Zografos, Konstantinos G.] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Management Sci, Ctr Transport & Logist CENTRAL, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Androutsopoulos, Konstantinos N.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, 47A,Evelpidon Str & 33, Athens 11362, Greece; [Madas, Michael A.] Univ Macedonia, Informat Syst & E Business Lab ISeB, Dept Appl Informat, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece",Lancaster University; Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Macedonia,"Zografos, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Management Sci, Ctr Transport & Logist CENTRAL, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",k.zografos@lancaster.ac.uk; kandro@aueb.gr; mmadas@uom.gr,"Androutsopoulos, Konstantinos N./G-6331-2010","Madas, Michael/0000-0002-9809-8485",UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC [EP/MO20258/1]; EPSRC [EP/M020258/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The work reported in this paper has been supported by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEPSRC) through the Programme Grant EP/MO20258/1 Mathematical models and algorithms for allocating scarce airport resources (OR-MASTER).

Positive public storage relaxes future participation constraints, hence it can improve risk sharing, contrary to the case where hidden income or effort is the deep friction. The characteristics of constrained-efficient allocations crucially depend on the storage technology's return. At the steady state, if the return on storage is (i) moderately high, both assets and the consumption distribution may remain time-varying; (ii) sufficiently high, assets converge almost surely to a constant and the consumption distribution is time-invariant; (iii) equal to agents' discount rate, perfect risk sharing is self-enforcing. Agents never have an incentive to use their private storage technology, i.e. Euler inequalities are always satisfied, at the constrained-efficient allocation of our model, while this is not the case without optimal public asset accumulation. Finally, we find that, in contrast with the limited-commitment model without storage, past income affects consumption growth negatively both in our model with storage and in data from Indian villages.","[Abraham, Arpad] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Laczo, Sarolta] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",European University Institute; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Abrahám, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",,,,JAE-Doc grant - European Social Fund; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [612796],JAE-Doc grant - European Social Fund; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)(European Union (EU)),"We thank two editors, four anonymous referees, Andy Atkeson, Piero Gottardi, Hugo Hopenhayn, Yang K.

Few UK listed companies make political donations but many more company directors do. We use a unique, hand-collected dataset of political donations to examine whether UK corporate political connections are perceived as being created indirectly via directors' personal donations. Basing our tests on the sensitivity of company returns to opinion polls preceding the 2010 General Election we find that, on average, firms in industries which donate only to the Conservative Party exhibit higher sensitivity to the electoral success of the Conservatives. However, within industries, there is no consistent evidence that the firms which employ directors who make these donations exhibit higher sensitivity than firms which do not.

Children want to conform to whatever norm is dominant but, lacking accurate information, take the observed behavior of their parents as representative.

Parents adopt attitudes that encourage their children to behave in a socially safe way (i.e., the way that would be optimal under maximum uncertainty about the prevailing social norm).

In contrast to previous studies, we distinguish between the average systematic risk of REITs and their asymmetric risk in the sense of a disproportionate likelihood of joint negative return clusters between REITs and the stock market. We find that REITs with low systematic risk are typically small, with low short-term momentum, low turnover, high growth opportunities and strong long-term momentum. Holding systematic risk constant, the main driving forces of asymmetric risk are leverage and, to some extent, short-term momentum. Specifically, we find that leverage has an asymmetric effect on REIT return dependence that outweighs the extent to which it increases the average sensitivity of REIT equity to market fluctuations, explaining the strong negative impact of leverage on firm performance especially during crisis periods that has been documented in recent empirical work.","[Alcock, Jamie] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steiner, Eva] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Sydney; University of Cambridge,"Steiner, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",es434@cam.ac.uk,"Steiner, Eva/GQP-3194-2022; Alcock, Jamie/D-8850-2013","Alcock, Jamie/0000-0002-9194-2129",RERI; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance,RERI; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from RERI.

We claim these disparities represent real gaps in economic opportunity for individuals of fixed characteristics. These gaps persist despite a strong migratory response, and we attribute this to high persistence in labor demand shocks. These trends generate a race between local employment and population: population always lags behind employment, yielding persistent deviations in employment rates.

The EU has committed to include gender perspectives by implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda (WPS) within its foreign security practices. While researchers and practitioners recognise the importance of integrating gender issues into SSR operational effectiveness, there is limited knowledge about how this functions within the EU's security architecture. This article uses Feminist Institutionalism (FI) to understand the process of gender mainstreaming within the EU's support to SSR programmes. It does this by using two crucial theory-testing cases of SSR programmes - Ukraine and Afghanistan. It finds that the EU's ability to promote gender inclusive approaches to SSR is limited by the structure of the EU's own assumptions and capabilities, and institutional constraints in third countries.

Rightfully so, as discounting can be quite influential on the outcomes of economic evaluations. The most prominent controversies regarding discounting involve the basis for and height of the discount rate, whether costs and effects should be discounted at the same rate, and whether discount rates should decline or stay constant over time. Moreover, the choice for discount rules depends on the decision context one adopts as the most relevant. In this article, we review these issues and debates, and describe and discuss the current discounting recommendations of the countries publishing their national guidelines.

Specifically, we examine the effects of sanitation coverage and usage on child height for age in a semi-urban setting in Northern India. Although sanitation - broadly defined as hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes, particularly human waste - has long been acknowledged as an indispensable element of disease prevention and primary health care programmes, a large number of recent impact evaluation studies on sanitation interventions in low income countries fail to find any health improvements. We address endogeneity of sanitation coverage through an instrumental variable approach, exploiting variation in raw material construction prices. Doing so, we find that sanitation coverage plays a significant and positive role in height growth during the first years of life and that this causal relationship holds particularly for girls. Our findings suggest that a policy that aims to increase sanitation coverage in a context such as the one studied here, is not only effective in reducing child stunting but also implicitly targets girls.

We find evidence of structural shifts and nonlinearity in the art indices. We cannot reject the null of unit root and/or stationarity in the art series based on the conventional linear unit root tests and quantile-based test that did not account for structural breaks. However, when we use the same methods but accounting for sharp shifts and smooth breaks, we are able to reject the unit root null for each of the art indices. Further we find evidence of asymmetric behaviour in some of the indices: two global indices, Paintings, Prints, Sculptures, Modern art and Postwar, where unit root exist at some quantiles but not at others. Overall, our result suggest that the art market is inefficient.

Finally, Josh Whitford explores the attempts to export of the concept of DQP to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, about 25 years ago.","[Baccaro, Lucio] Univ Geneva, Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Doellgast, Virginia] Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Edwards, Tony] Loughborough Univ London, Inst Int Management, London, England; [Whitford, Josh] Columbia Univ City New York, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Geneva; Max Planck Society; Cornell University; Loughborough University; Columbia University,"Baccaro, L (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Geneva, Switzerland.;Doellgast, V (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Edwards, T (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ London, Inst Int Management, London, England.;Whitford, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ City New York, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",baccaro@mpifg.de; vld7@cornell.edu; T.Edwards@lboro.ac.uk; jw2212@columbia.edu,,"Baccaro, Lucio/0000-0001-6410-6179",,,,,53,5,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In models with a homogeneous sector, local market size is generally more strongly correlated with a country's industry share, whereas accessibility better explains a country's wage. We analytically show that result in a simplified case and then confirm it using simulations with random trading networks. In models with only differentiated sectors, both local market size and accessibility are highly correlated with wages.

Exploiting the concentric dispersion of Protestantism around Wittenberg, our instrumental variable model finds that Protestantism had a substantial positive effect on suicide.

GPs have a dual role with regard to elective referrals in the English NHS, advising patients and at the same time taking account of the financial implications of referral decisions on local health budgets. The paper proposes a two-stage choice model that encompasses both patient and GP level optimization. It demonstrates that estimators that do not take account of strategic pre-selection of choice sets may be biased and inconsistent. We find that GPs as patients' agents select choice options based on quality, but as agents of health authorities also consider financial implications of referrals. When considering these choice options, patients focus on tangible hospital attributes, like amenities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, the Swedish economy has responded to the global financial crisis (GFC) in what appears to be a successful manner. This comparativist literature nevertheless omits in-depth analysis of the impact of financialisation, partly due to its neglect of long-term, dialectical processes of change (cf. Ogden et al., 2014). There is a small literature on financialisation in Sweden (e.g. Belfrage, 2008; Forslund, 2008; Kallifatides et al., 2010; Ryner, 2013; Belfrage, 2015; Andersson and Jonung, 2015; Kallifatides, 2016). However, it has not clarified what the dynamics, contradictions and crisis-tendencies of the resulting finance-dominated accumulation regime in Sweden are. Drawing on document analysis and statistics, and based on Regulation Theory (e.g. Aglietta, 1979), this paper does just that. It thus corrects an overly idealised picture of Swedish economy and society, as well as, more broadly, holding the Swedish case up as a critical case study for the sustainability of the financedominated growth regime in Europe. We argue that there is a looming crisis in the Swedish economy today, as the acceleration of financialisation following the GFC is shifting the economy away from being export-led to becoming debt-led and assetbased, and thus moving the economy closer to the UK and US economies. As such, the Swedish case suggests that the finance-dominated growth regime may be unsustainable in Europe more generally.","[Belfrage, Claes] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Chatham St, Chatham L69 7ZH, Kent, England; [Kallifatides, Markus] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Governance & Management, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Liverpool; Stockholm School of Economics,"Belfrage, C (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Chatham St, Chatham L69 7ZH, Kent, England.",c.belfrage@liverpool.ac.uk; Markus.Kallifatides@hhs.se,"Kallifatides, Markus/AAT-7634-2020","Kallifatides, Markus/0000-0002-2039-0339",,,,,85,25,26,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Although it is often claimed that firms in Europe have less flexibility in their ability to hire and fire, we find that the relationship between employment growth and worker flows in German establishments is very similar to the behaviour of U.S. establishments. The relationship is stable over time, even during the 2008-9 economic crisis and across different types of establishment. We verify our results with independent measures from administrative data. We suggest that this result is due to: the strong relationship between employment reductions and voluntary separations; the low level of churning'; and the heterogeneity of jobs within establishments.","[Bellmann, Lutz; Gerner, Hans-Dieter] Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, Nurnberg, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Nottingham,"Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, Nurnberg, Germany.;Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.",,,"Bellmann, Lutz/0000-0002-4892-5454",,,,,24,5,6,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We refer to these episodes as stagnation traps, because they consist in the joint occurrence of a liquidity and a growth trap. In a stagnation trap, the central bank is unable to restore full employment because weak growth depresses aggregate demand and pushes the policy rate against the zero lower bound, while growth is weak because low aggregate demand results in low profits, limiting firms' investment in innovation. Aggressive policies aiming at restoring growth, such as subsidies to investment, can successfully lead the economy out of a stagnation trap by generating a regime shift in agents' growth expectations.","[Benigno, Gianluca] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England; [Benigno, Gianluca] CFM, Paris, France; [Fornaro, Luca] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Fornaro, Luca] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Benigno, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England.;Benigno, G (通讯作者)，CFM, Paris, France.",,"Fornaro, Luca/L-2744-2014",,"ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship [ES/I024174/1]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-23192]; Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]; European Central Bank; ESRC [ES/R009295/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); European Central Bank; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the Editor, Gita Gopinath, four anonymous referees, Philippe Aghion, Pierpaolo Benigno, Javier Bianchi, Seonghoon Cho, Roger Farmer, Andrea Ferrero, Jordi Gali, Jang-Ting Guo, Bob Hall, Chad Jones, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Robert Kollmann, Tommaso Monacelli, Jaume Ventura, Alwyn Young, and participants at several seminars and conferences for useful comments.

Our model endogenizes the packaging design as an additional determinant for the overall amount of waste jointly with consumers' sorting effort and producers' output decisions. The model shows that the policies that yield the first-best allocation may not find public support. Furthermore, if the set of available policy instruments is limited, production and consumption of the good is likely to settle on a sub-optimal level even though the optimal allocation may be achievable. Finally, the model demonstrates that a landfill tax may actually increase landfill waste in the presence of tradable credits for recycling activities. The results shed light on some shortcomings of existing regulatory schemes such as the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations of the UK.","[Berger, Wolfram] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus Senftenberg, Cottbus, Germany; [Nagase, Yoko] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford, England",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Oxford Brookes University,"Berger, W (通讯作者)，Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus Senftenberg, Cottbus, Germany.",,,,,,,,29,4,4,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The results cover (a) simultaneous price-change of multiple alternatives, (b) introduction/elimination of an option, (c) changes in choice-characteristics, and (d) choice among nonexclusive alternatives. In these cases, Marshallian consumer surplus becomes path-dependent, but Hicksian welfare remains well-defined. We demonstrate that under completely unrestricted preference-heterogeneity and income-effects, the distributions of Hicksian welfare are point-identified from structural choice-probabilities in scenarios (a), (b), and only set-identified in (c), (d). In program-evaluation contexts, our results enable the calculation of compensated-effects, that is, the program's cash-equivalent and resulting deadweight-loss. They also facilitate a theoretically justified cost-benefit comparison of interventions targeting different outcomes, for example, a tuition-subsidy and a health-product subsidy. Welfare analyses under endogeneity is briefly discussed. An application to data on choice of fishing-mode illustrates the methods.","[Bhattacharya, Debopam] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Bhattacharya, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.",debobhatta@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

It is shown theoretically that if enforcement is effective in deterring and constraining cartels then there will be fewer cartels with low overcharges and fewer with high overcharges. This prediction provides an indirect method for testing whether the enforcement of competition law is effective. Using historical data on legal cartels to generate the counterfactual, we find significantly less mass in the tails of the overcharge distribution, compared to illegal cartels. This result is robust to controlling for confounding factors, and we interpret this as the first tentative confirmation of effective deterrence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, childhood wealth seems to proxy for intergenerational correlation in savings behaviour and additional transfers from parents.","[Boserup, Simon Halphen] Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; Columbia Univ, CEPR, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, London, England; CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Copenhagen; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Columbia University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Kreiner, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ctk@econ.ku.dk,,"Boserup, Simon Halphen/0000-0001-5692-9298; Kreiner, Claus Thustrup/0000-0001-6421-492X; Kopczuk, Wojciech/0000-0001-8678-275X",Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF - 1329-00046],Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),Financial support from the Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN) and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF - 1329-00046) is gratefully acknowledged.,,28,28,29,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Using a structural new economic geography approach, we find that these policies have shaped regional economic development and urbanization patterns across China in very different ways. The construction of the NEN has reinforced China's existing core-periphery patterns: initially lagging regions not connected to the NEN have not benefitted much from its construction. By contrast, a removal of the Hukou restrictions is predicted to result in much more widespread welfare gains, allowing all people to benefit by moving to where they are most productive. Interestingly, it would even promote urbanization in currently lagging (inland) regions, mostly by stimulating rural outmigration.","[Bosker, Maarten] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] CEPR, London, England; [Deichmann, Uwe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Roberts, Mark] World Bank, Social Urban Rural & Resilience Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bosker@ese.eur.nl; udeichmann@worldbank.org; mroberts1@worldbank.org,"Roberts, Mark/HSG-3436-2023",,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,"The authors thank the editor and three anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that significantly improved earlier versions of the paper.

Using two structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models and a counterfactual scenario analysis, the results show that monetary policy shocks, as identified by changes in Treasury yields following changes in the central bank's target interest rates, lead to a substantial increase in pension funds' allocation to equity assets. Notably, the shift from bonds to equity securities is greater during the period where the US Federal Reserve launched unconventional monetary policy measures. Additional findings show a positive correlation between pension fund risk-taking, low interest rates and the decline in Treasury yields across both well-funded and underfunded public pension plans, which is thus consistent with a structural risk-shifting incentive.

As GDP per capita increases, average total hours worked and average household hours per working-age population decrease while average market hours increase (marketization); hours producing services increase their share in total hours (structural transformation). The decrease in household hours is mostly due to changes in housework (cleaning, cooking etc.) and marketization is mostly due to changes in women's hours. Within countries, more educated people work more in the market and less in the household. We also impute the labor productivity of household production for 34 countries of our sample.

The method, which can accommodate lagged dependent variables, serially correlated errors, unobserved variables, and many alternatives, builds on the ideas of indirect inference. The main difficulty in implementing indirect inference in discrete choice models is that the objective surface is a step function, rendering gradient based optimization methods useless. To overcome this obstacle, this paper shows how to smooth the objective surface. The key idea is to use a smoothed function of the latent utilities as the dependent variable in the auxiliary model. As the smoothing parameter goes to zero, this function delivers the discrete choice implied by the latent utilities, thereby guaranteeing consistency. We establish conditions on the smoothing such that our estimator enjoys the same limiting distribution as the indirect inference estimator, while at the same time ensuring that the smoothing facilitates the convergence of gradient based optimization methods. A set of Monte Carlo experiments shows that the method is fast, robust, and nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood when the auxiliary model is sufficiently rich.

Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was A 28,748 pound per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept, and had an ICER of A 5680 pound per QALY gained versus adalimumab and > A 1 pound million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between A 20,000 pound and A 30,000 pound, the probability of secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs). Parameters related to Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were most influential. Secukinumab 150 mg at list price appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for adults with PsA who have responded inadequately to one or two or more prior csDMARDs.","[Buchanan, Vanessa; Sullivan, Will] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Chris; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Jugl, Steffen Marc] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, England; [Kirkham, Bruce] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Kirkham, Bruce] Kings Coll London, London, England",Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; King's College London,"Halliday, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.com,,"Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095; Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,30,5,5,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36,7,,,,,867,878,,10.1007/s40273-018-0674-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0674-x,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29797187,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000435397300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to resolve overdemands for a given school, most often priority is given to families living in the neighborhood of the school. Using a very rich data set on school applications for the case of the Boston mechanism in Barcelona, we exploit an unexpected change in the definition of neighborhood. This change allows us to identify that a large fraction of families systematically ranks first high priority schools, neighborhood schools in this case. Additional data on school enrollment decisions and census data shows that some seemingly unsophisticated parents are high income families that can rank hard-to-get schools because they can afford the outside option of a private school in case they do not get in. This sheds light on important inequalities beyond parents' lack of sophistication found in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To this aim, we use aggregate bilateral data on tourist flows and various data on museums in the twenty Italian regions. To solve the potential endogeneity of the supply of museums, we use three different empirical strategies: we use a fixed effects model controlling for bilateral macro-area dummies, we compute the degree of selection on unobservables relative to observables which would be necessary to drive the result to zero and, finally, we adopt a two-stage least squares approach that uses a measure of historical patronage, the number of noble families, as an instrument for the number of museums. For each empirical strategy, there is strong evidence of a positive effect of the number of 'net-museums' on bilateral tourist flows.","[Campaniello, Nadia] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Campaniello, Nadia] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Richiardi, Matteo] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Richiardi, Matteo] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",University of Essex; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Oxford; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Campaniello, N (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.;Campaniello, N (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",ncampa@essex.ac.uk,"Campaniello, Nadia/AAE-3971-2019","Richiardi, Matteo/0000-0002-3749-7386; Campaniello, Nadia/0000-0001-9497-7194",,,,,48,4,4,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We conduct an investigation of party-supporter congruence in Europe with emphasis on the measurement of ideology and focusing on the role of party system polarization, both as a direct factor in explaining congruence and in modifying the effects of voter sophistication. Understanding this relationship depends in part on how the ideology of parties and supporters is measured. We use Poole's Blackbox scaling to derive a measure of latent ideology from voter and expert responses to issue scale questions and compare this to a measure based on left-right perceptions. We then examine how variation in the proximity between parties ideological positions and those of their supporters is affected by the polarization of the party system and how this relationship interacts with political sophistication. With the latent ideology measure, we find that polarization decreases party-supporter congruence but increases the effects of respondent education level on congruence. However, we do not find these relationships using the left-right perceptual measure. Our findings underscore important differences between perceptions of left-right labels and the ideological constraint underlying issue positions.","[Carroll, Royce] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Kubo, Hiroki] Meijigakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Essex,"Carroll, R (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",r.carroll@essex.ac.uk; hkubo@law.meijigakuin.ac.jp,"Carroll, Royce/AAA-1721-2020; Carroll, Royce/GVT-6628-2022","Carroll, Royce/0000-0002-3185-0329;",,,,,88,3,4,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176,1-2,,,SI,,247,265,,10.1007/s11127-018-0562-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11127-018-0562-0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000438459400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using geographically disaggregated data at the level of grid cells the analysis provides empirical evidence for a hump-shaped relationship between the long run stability and force malaria transmission and the incidence of civil violence. In line with epidemiological predictions about the acquired immunity to malaria, cells that are characterized by intermediate malaria exposure exhibit higher conflict incidence than cells with very low or very high malaria exposure. We explore the role of the expansion of anti-malaria policies after 2005 in the context of the Roll Back Malaria programme.

A dynamic structural model of employment, fertility, and child care use is estimated using Norwegian administrative data. The estimation exploits a large-scale child care reform, which provided generous cash transfers to mothers who did not use formal child care facilities. We find that the reform generates sizable changes in employment and fertility decisions, especially among low-education women. We then use the mothers' unobserved heterogeneity in the structural model as a control function to examine the effects of mothers' behavior on long-run cognitive outcomes of children. The reform leads to lower reading scores among children, primarily as a result of mothers shifting to inferior forms of care. In counterfactual simulations, we compare the effects of an alternative child care subsidy, an expanded maternity leave program, and a tax deduction for mothers with children.","[Chan, Marc K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Liu, Kai] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Norwegian Sch Econ, Cambridge, England; [Liu, Kai] IZA, Cambridge, England",University of Melbourne; Melbourne Bioinformatics; University of Cambridge,"Chan, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",marc.chan@unimelb.edu.au; kai.liu@econ.cam.ac.uk,,"Chan, Marc/0000-0002-1010-7587",,,,,60,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Through the use of these new datasets it is possible to analyse how these vary spatially and in relation to levels of median income.

Using a structural VAR model with Bayesian sign restrictions, we show that adverse shocks to aggregate demand and supply cause an increase in the persistent component of both stock and bond market volatility, and that adverse shocks to the persistent component of either stock or bond market volatility cause a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals. We find no evidence of a relationship between the transitory component of volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals. Instead, we find that the transitory component is more closely associated with changes in investor sentiment. Our results are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications. Out-of-sample forecasting shows that the components of volatility can improve forecasts of macroeconomic fundamentals, and vice versa. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We study three situations: in gain two players start with no prize and make sunk bids to win a prize; in loss both the players start with prizes and whoever loses the contest loses their prize; and in mixed only one player starts with a prize that stays with him if he wins, but is transferred to the rival otherwise. Since the differences among the treatments arise only from framing, the expected utility and the standard loss aversion models predict no difference in bids across treatments. We introduce a loss aversion model in which the property rights are made salient, and as a result the reference point varies across treatments. This model predicts average bids in descending order in the loss, the mixed, and the gain treatment; and higher bids by the player with property rights in the mixed treatment. The results from a laboratory experiment broadly support these predictions. There is no significant difference in bids in the loss (gain) treatment and bids by property rights holder (nonholder) in the mixed treatment. A model incorporating both loss aversion and social preferences explains this result.

OCMT is easy to interpret, relates to classical statistical analysis, is valid under general assumptions, is faster to compute, and performs well in small samples.

The single agent, in a dynamic exchange economy, treats the conditional uncertainty about the consumption and dividends next period as ambiguous. We calibrate the agent's ambiguity aversion to match only the first moment of the risk-free rate in data and measure the uncertainty each period conditional on the actual, observed history of (U.S.) macroeconomic growth outcomes. Ambiguity aversion accentuates the effect of conditional uncertainty endogenously in a dynamic way, depending on the history; for example, it increases during recessions. We show the model implied time series of asset returns substantially match the first and second conditional moments of observed return dynamics. In particular, we find the time-series properties of our model generated equity premium, which may be regarded as an index measure of revealed uncertainty, relates closely to those of the macroeconomic uncertainty indices developed recently in Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng, 2015 and Carriero, Clark, and Marcellino, forthcoming.","[Collard, Fabrice] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Mukerji, Sujoy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Sheppard, Kevin] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Tallon, Jean-Marc] Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Oxford; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics,"Collard, F (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",fabrice.collard@gmail.com; s.mukerji@qmul.ac.uk; kevin.sheppard@keble.ox.ac.uk; jean-marc.tallon@psemail.eu,,"Tallon, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1762-9633",Investissement d'Avenir Program [ANR-10-LABX-93],Investissement d'Avenir Program,"We thank three referees and the editor for thoughtful comments and suggestions.

It argues that the degree of progress in EU social policy in the European Semester (2011-15) has been conditional and contingent. EU social policy is more oriented to supporting market development than it is to correcting for market failures.

The quantification of movement is addressed using a general concept of distance between positions and a parsimonious set of axioms that characterize the distance concept and yield a class of aggregative indices. This class of indices induces a superclass of mobility measures over the different status concepts consistent with the same underlying data. We investigate the statistical inference of mobility indices using two well-known status concepts, related to income mobility and rank mobility.

Data from emerging data sources provide new opportunities to examine repeated trip making on the road network. Point-to-point sensor data, for example from Bluetooth detectors, is collected using fixed detectors installed next to roads which can record unique identifiers of passing vehicles or travellers which can then be matched across space and time. Such data is used in this research to segment road users based on their repeated trip making behaviour, as has been done in public transportation research using smart card data to understand different categories of users. Rather than deciding on traveller segmentation based on a priori assumptions, the method provides a data driven approach to cluster together travellers who have similar trip regularity and variability between days. Measures which account for the strengths and weaknesses of point-to-point sensor data are presented for (a) spatial variability, using Sequence Alignment, and (b) time of day variability, using Model Based Clustering. The proposed method is also applied to one year of data from 23 fixed Bluetooth detectors in a town in northwest England. The data consists of almost 7.5 million trips made by over 300,000 travellers. Applying the proposed methods allows three traveller user classes to be identified: infrequent, frequent, and very frequent. Interestingly, the spatial and time of day variability characteristics of each user class are distinct and are not linearly correlated with trip frequency. The frequent travellers are observed 1-5 times per week on average and make up 57% of the trips recorded during the year. Focusing on these frequent travellers, it is shown that these can be further separated into those with high spatial and time of day variability and those with low spatial and time of day variability. Understanding the distribution of travellers and trips across these user classes, as well as the repeated trip characteristics of each user class, can inform further data collection and the development of policies targeting the needs of specific travellers.","[Crawford, F.] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Bristol, Avon, England; [Watling, D.

This paper first quantifies the consequences of allowing a completely electric fleet to charge freely, then considers whether there is a practical way in which the impacts can be mitigated. We predict that, with an entirely electric fleet, the UK power generation capacity would need to increase by 1/3. We show that it is possible to completely mitigate this with controlled charging, although substantial infrastructure would be required. However, we propose a simple scheme which could largely avoid the negative effect and does not require the creation of new infrastructure. We show that this reduces the projected increase in peak electricity demand by 80-99%.","[Crozier, Constance; McCulloch, Malcolm] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Apostolopoulou, Dimitra] Univ London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London EC1V 0HB, England",University of Oxford; University of London,"Crozier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England.",constance.crozier@eng.ox.ac.uk; dimitra.apostolopoulou@eng.ox.ac.uk; malcolm.mcculloch@eng.ox.ac.uk,"McCulloch, Malcolm/AAR-3602-2020; Crozier, Constance/AAB-1012-2021","McCulloch, Malcolm/0000-0001-5378-1128; Crozier, Constance/0000-0001-9774-2729",Jaguar Land Rover,Jaguar Land Rover,This work was supported by Jaguar Land Rover,,32,11,11,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118,,,,,,474,481,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.056,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000435050000042,View Full Record in Web of Science

The theoretically optimal mechanism in this model is the lowest-price all-pay auctionan auction in which the highest bidder wins the prize and all bidders pay the lowest bid. The highest amount for the public good is generated in the unique, symmetric, mixed-strategy equilibrium of this auction.

Previous studies typically model the growth in infected area using geometric Brownian motion (GBM). The advantage of this simple approach is that it allows for closed form solutions. However, such a process does not capture the mechanisms underlying the spread of infection. In particular the GBM assumption does not respect the natural upper boundary of the system, which is determined by the maximum size of the host species, nor the deceleration in the rate of infection as this boundary is approached. We show how the stochastic process describing the growth in infected area can be derived from the characteristics of the spread of infection. If the model used does not appropriately capture uncertainty in infection dynamics, then the excessive delay before treatment implies that the full value of the option to treat is not realised. Indeed, when uncertainty is high or the disease is fast spreading, ignoring the mechanisms of infection spread can lead to control never being deployed. Thus the results presented here have important implications for the way in which the real options approach is applied to determine optimal timing of disease control given uncertainty in future disease progression.","[Dangerfield, C.

We provide evidence from a lab experiment that participants interacting in a dynamic game of common pool resource extraction reduce their cooperation on efficient levels of resource extraction when given the possibility to appropriate the resource at some cost, i.e. through conflict. Theoretically, cooperation is achievable via the threat of punishment strategies, which stop being subgame perfect in the presence of conflict. Accordingly we argue that the observed reduction of cooperation in the game's early stages in the lab is a consequence of participants (correctly) anticipating the use of appropriation when resources become scarce.

Current empirical evidence supports the existence of a negative effect of the Italian ban on smoking prevalence and consumption in the general population. Our analysis shows that the apparent success of the ban is due to the fact that existing results do not take into account seasonal differences in smoking behaviour. Using quarterly data from the 1999/2000 and 2004/2005 Italian Health Surveys and adopting a difference-indifference approach that nets out monthly variation in smoking rates, we show that the Italian smoking ban had no impact on smoking behaviour for the population as a whole but only on some subgroups. This result notwithstanding, we find that the smoking ban increased the overall well-being of non-smokers.","[Del Bono, Emilia] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Del Bono, Emilia] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Vuri, Daniela] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",University of Essex; University of Bergen; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Vuri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.",daniela.vuri@uniroma2.it,,"Del Bono, Emilia/0000-0002-1551-3074",British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants [SG111344]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [ES/L009153/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI,British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants [grant number SG111344] and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [grant number ES/L009153/1].,,49,5,6,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Since 2010, there has been increased activity in the development of treatments that aim to delay progression of the disease. Objective Our study involves a comprehensive review of the literature for evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs, and an assessment of the burden of illness of the condition. Methods We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify economic evaluations and HRQoL studies. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process for relevant studies from database origins to April 2017. Alongside the presentation of the study characteristics and the available evidence, we carried out a qualitative comparison using reference population estimates for HRQoL and national health expenditure for costs. Results Our search identified a total of 3241 records. After removing duplicates and not relevant articles, we analysed 124 publications referring to 88 studies published between 2000 and 2017. Sixty studies were HRQoL and 28 were studies on costs or HCRU. We observed an exponential growth of publications in the last 3-5 years, with the majority of the studies conducted in Europe and North America. Among the HRQoL studies, and despite regional differences, there was some agreement between estimates on the absolute and relative level of HRQoL for patients with IPF compared with the general population. Regarding costs, after adjustments for the cost years and currency, the suggested annual per capita cost of patients with IPF in North America was estimated around US$20,000, 2.5-3.5 times higher than the national healthcare expenditure. Additionally, studies that analysed patients with IPF alongside a matched control cohort suggested a significant increase in resource use and cost. Conclusion The reviewed evidence indicates that IPF has considerable impact on HRQoL, relative to the general population levels. Furthermore, in studies of cost and resource use, most estimates of the burden were consistent in suggesting an excess cost for patients with IPF compared with a control cohort or the national health expenditure. This confirms IPF as a growing threat for public health worldwide, with considerable impact to the patients and healthcare providers.","[Diamantopoulos, Alex; Wright, Emily; Vlahopoulou, Katerina; Cornic, Laura] Symmetron Ltd, Elstree, England; [Schoof, Nils] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Maher, Toby M.] Royal Brompton Hosp, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, London, England; [Maher, Toby M.] Imperial Coll London, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, Fibrosis Res Grp, London, England",Boehringer Ingelheim; Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London,"Diamantopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Symmetron Ltd, Elstree, England.",alexd@symmetron.net,"Maher, Toby M/C-1575-2008; Maher, Toby/AAM-1618-2020","Maher, Toby/0000-0001-7192-9149; Diamantopoulos, Alex/0000-0002-5700-6265; Schoof, Nils/0000-0003-0509-9217",Boehringer Ingelheim,Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim),This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim.,,153,57,63,1,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36,7,,,,,779,807,,10.1007/s40273-018-0631-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0631-8,,,29,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29492843,Green Published,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000435397300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conjecture that the government censors negative news and promotes positive news in Chinese media, leading to the premium on A-shares, which are mainly traded by domestic investors. We find that the ratio of positive to negative news is substantially higher for Chinese newspapers than English news-papers. Such favouritism is found to inflate the price of domestic A-shares and contribute to the discount of foreign B-shares from the same firms. We also provide evidence that B-share investors pay more attention to bad news, while A-share investors pay more attention to good news. Our findings suggest that the news perception distorted by media censorship helps to explain the foreign share discount puzzle and has important implications for international capital flows.

Studying the evolution of coagglomeration patterns, we show that the type of agglomeration that benefits firms has drastically changed over the course of a century and differs markedly across industries. Whereas, at the beginning of the twentieth century, industries tended to colocate with their value chain partners, in more recent decades the importance of this channel has declined and colocation seems to be driven more by similarities in industries' skill requirements. By calculating industry-specific Marshallian agglomeration forces, we are able to show that, today, skill-sharing is the most salient motive behind the location choices of services, whereas value chain linkages still explain much of the colocation patterns in manufacturing. Moreover, the estimated degrees to which labor and input-output linkages are reflected in an industry's coagglomeration patterns help improve predictions of city-industry employment growth.

These limit distributions are shown to be non-standard, but we show that they can be easily simulated, making it possible to perform inference about the parameters in this setting. We illustrate our results in the context of a dynamic panel data model in which the parameter of interest is identified locally at second order by non-linear moment restrictions but not at first order at a particular point in the parameter space. Our simulation results indicate that our theory leads to reliable inferences in moderate to large samples in the neighbourhood of this point of first-order identification failure. In contrast, inferences based on standard asymptotic theory (derived under the assumption of first-order local identification) are very misleading in the neighbourhood of the point of first-order local identification failure.

In equilibrium, the risk premium decreases after a positive shock and, therefore, trend chasing young agents lose wealth relative to old agents who behave as contrarians.

We develop a model with optimal default and monetary-union exit decisions of a small open economy. Our model can account for the behavior of sovereign bond spreads in the eurozone with the arrival of the news of Greece potentially exiting the euro in the near future. In our theoretical framework, belonging to the monetary-union entails a strong exchange rate peg, which can be abandoned only if the country exits the union. Exit is costly and the cost of exit remains unknown until the first country leaves the union. The theoretical mechanism we explore reveals that while a high expected exit-cost could improve the credibility of a monetary union, uncertainty governing exit-cost realizations could make the monetary-union members prone to surges in interest rates when rumors of a member state exiting arise. We solve the model numerically and quantify that a Grexit-rumors type of shock can triple the default likelihood of an a-priori financially healthy member state. Our framework thus provides a novel and quantitatively important explanation for the eurozone crisis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We address the potential endogeneity of the 'legalization treatment' by instrumenting the actual number of legalized immigrants with alternative predicted measures based on past amnesty applications patterns and residential choices of documented and undocumented immigrants. We find that, in the year following an amnesty, regions in which a higher share of immigrants obtained legal status experienced a greater decline in non-EU immigrant crime rates, relative to other regions. The effect is statistically significant but relatively small and not persistent. In further results, we fail to find any evidence of substitution in the criminal market from other population groups-namely, EU immigrants and Italian citizens-and we observe a small and not persistent reduction in total offenses.","[Fasani, Francesco] Queen Mary Univ London, CEPR, CReAM, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Fasani, Francesco] IZA, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Fasani, F (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, CEPR, CReAM, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.;Fasani, F (通讯作者)，IZA, London, England.",f.fasani@qmul.ac.uk,,"Fasani, Francesco/0000-0003-4053-4341",Fondazione Debenedetti,Fondazione Debenedetti,"I wish to thank the editor and three anonymous referees for very constructive feedback on an earlier version of this paper.

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace 'big data' - Facebook's advertisement audience estimates - that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform's over 2 billion users to measure and 'nowcast' digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining 'online' indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, 'offline' indicators related to a country's overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.

It is hardly a surprise that all across Europe, but especially in high corruption risk countries, it is a primary target of corrupt elites. This article provides a state-ofthe-art review of the literature on the cost of corruption and estimates the level of corruption risks and associated costs in European infrastructure development and maintenance in 2009-2014 using novel data on over 40,000 government contracts. Two forms of corruption costs are investigated in the empirical section: (1) distorting spending structure and project design, and (2) inflating prices. Findings indicate that corruption steers infrastructure spending towards high value as opposed to small value investment projects. It also inflates prices by 30-35% on average with largest excesses in high corruption risk regions. Contrary to perceptions, corruption risks in infrastructure are decoupled to a considerable extent from the national corruption environment.

The model incorporates two competitive channels for merger effects: the price coordination channel and the internalization of the innovation externality. We solve the model numerically and find that price coordination between the two products of the merged firm tends to stimulate innovation, while internalization of the innovation externality depresses it. The latter effect is stronger in our simulations and, as a result, the merger leads to lower innovation incentives for the merged entity, absent cost efficiencies and knowledge spillovers. In our numerical analysis both overall innovation and consumer welfare fall after a merger. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct this comparison for two, four, and six firms.

This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the farmer's decision environment in this situation and uses a numerical analysis to illustrate both the potential for a range of levels of compensation payments to achieve this dual incentivising, and how this range is affected by changes in the parameter values of the farmer's decision environment.

To do this we compare social and asocial versions of the Gill and Prowse experiment, where the latter treatment removes the scope for social comparisons. If disappointment aversion simply reflects an asymmetric evaluation of losses and gains we would expect it to survive in our asocial treatment. Alternatively, if losing to or winning against another person affects the evaluation of losses/gains, as we show would be theoretically the case under asymmetric inequality aversion, we would expect treatment differences. We find behavior in social and asocial treatments to be similar, suggesting that social comparisons have little impact in this setting.

Evidence in the Northern Ireland context has further suggested that applying these models to property markets may be inappropriate given the underlying statistical properties of these time series (Gallagher et al., 2015). These issues combined suggest that there may be merit in examining cases of financial crises through alternative theoretical frameworks and in adopting a more pluralist approach. With this in mind, this paper investigates whether Minsky's (1975, 1986, 1992) Financial Instability Hypothesis can assist in understanding the recent property market crisis in Northern Ireland, which was severe by both national and international standards. Using qualitative evidence to analyse the behaviours of borrowers represented by property developers and lenders represented by banks over the course of the business cycle, this paper assesses the relevance of Minsky's arguments. The findings show that Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis explains the incidents observed in Northern Ireland's property market in recent years.","[Gallagher, Emer Marie] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England; [Ramsey, Elaine] Ulster Univ, Business Sch, Coleraine Campus,Cromore Rd, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Bond, Derek] Hubei Normal Univ, Int Off, Huangshia, Peoples R China",University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University; Ulster University; Hubei Normal University,"Gallagher, EM (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England.",e.m.gallagher@ljmu.ac.uk; e.ramsey@ulster.ac.uk; d.bond.esq@gmail.com,"Bond, Derek/S-3169-2019","RAMSEY, ELAINE/0000-0003-4043-763X",,,,,42,0,0,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In the last years regulators introduced, with the Solvency II directive, a market consistent valuation framework for determining the fair value of asset and liabilities of insurance funds. A relevant aspect is how to deal with the estimation of sovereign credit and liquidity risk, that are important components in the valuation of the majority of insurance funds, which are usually heavily invested in treasury bonds. The common practice is the adoption of the certainty equivalent approach (CEQ) for the risk neutral evaluation of insurance liabilities, which results in a deterministic risk adjustment of the securities cash flows. In this paper, we propose an arbitrage free stochastic model for interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, that takes into account the dependences between different government bond issuers. We test the impact of the common practice against our proposed model, via Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude that in the estimation of options whose pay-off is determined by statutory accounting rules, which is often the case for European traditional with-profit insurance products, the deterministic adjustment for risk of the securities cash flows is not appropriate, and that a more complete model such as the one described in this article is a viable and sensible alternative in the context of market consistent evaluations.

The results are valid for director re-elections but not for first appointment elections as in the latter cases, shareholders may not as yet be familiar with a director's looks. In firms with few institutional shareholders and more retail investors owning small equity stakes, the latter tend to rely more on facial appearance than institutional shareholders, presumably as institutions conduct more research on the director's background and performance, and consequently rely less on facial appearance. While female directors generally experience lower voting dissent, their facial appearance does not affect their elections results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, another important promise of the treaties has been ignored altogether. Architects of the investment treaty regime, as well as many current proponents, have suggested that the treaties allow developing countries to de-politicize investor-state disputes; i.e. shield commercial disputes from broader political and diplomatic considerations with developed states. While this argument is widely accepted by legal scholars and practitioners and explicitly promoted by capital-exporting states, it has never been subjected to empirical investigation. We provide the first such test, using an original dataset of US diplomatic actions in 219 individual investment disputes across 73 countries as well as detailed case studies drawing on internal US State Department diplomatic cables. We find no evidence for the de-politicization hypothesis: diplomatic engagement remains important for investor-state dispute settlement, and the US government is just as likely to intervene in developing countries that have ratified investment treaties with the US as those that have not. Coercive American intervention in investment disputes is rare, but this is a general feature of American investment diplomacy after the Cold War, rather than one limited to investors with recourse to legalized dispute settlement procedures. These findings provide a critical corrective to our understanding of the investment treaty regime, and have important implications for understanding the effects of international legalization on developing countries.

We employed longitudinal administrative data from Spain (2004-2010) to explore the relationship between uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and health care utilisation. We used a biomarker (glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c) to detect the presence of uncontrolled diabetes and explore its effects on both primary and secondary health care. We estimated a range of panel count data models, including negative binomials with random effects, dynamic and hurdle specifications to account for unobserved heterogeneity, previous utilisation and selection. We found uncontrolled diabetes in between 27 and 30% of patients of both genders. Our estimates suggested that although women appeared to systematically consume more health care compared to men, their consumption levels did not seem to be influenced by uncontrolled diabetes. Conversely, among men uncontrolled diabetes increased the average number of GP visits per year by between 3 and 3.4%, specialist visits by 5.3-6.1%, depending on specifications, and also extended annual hospital length of stay by 15%. We also found some evidence of heterogeneity in utilisation based on the level of uncontrolled diabetes among male individuals. Overall, our results suggested the need for different diabetes management plans depending on gender and levels of glycaemic control.","[Gil, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gil, Joan] Univ Barcelona, BEAT, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sicras-Mainar, Antoni] BSA, Barcelona, Spain; [Zucchelli, Eugenio] Univ Lancaster, DHR, Lancaster, England",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Lancaster University,"Gil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Gil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, BEAT, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",joangil@ub.edu,"Zucchelli, Eugenio/Z-4871-2019; Gil Trasfí, Joan/N-6360-2014","Zucchelli, Eugenio/0000-0003-3883-5006; Gil Trasfí, Joan/0000-0003-4159-379X",Catalan Government [2014-SGR-1257],Catalan Government,"We are grateful to Bruce Hollingsworth, Paolo Li Donni, Ian Walker, Will Whittaker, Giuseppe Moscelli and participants to the 2015 UK Health Economists Study Group (HESG) Conference, XXXV Spanish Health Economics Association Conference, 11th World Congress of the International Health Economics Association (iHEA) and the 2016 EuHEA Conference for helpful comments.

Political support from firms can be pivotal for governments trying to protect the environment. I offer an explanation for this phenomenon, suggesting firms behave as they do in order to steal market share from their rivals. I develop a model in which a polluting firm makes a clean technology investment and then lobbies successfully for strong environmental protection, since this will shift market share away from its rival who has not made the clean investment. The key result concerns the impact of lobbying on the equilibrium outcome: for a region of the parameter space, it is only because of firms' lobbying that environmental protection is achieved. This is because lobbying increases a firm's returns to going green, by increasing the market share it can steel. The net effect of this distortion is an increase in welfare.

This study aimed to evaluate whether age is associated with health care costs in the senior elderly, using electronic health records for 98,220 participants aged 80 years and over registered with the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (2010-2014). Annual costs of health care utilization were estimated from a two-part model; multiple fractional polynomial models were employed to evaluate the non-linear association of age with predicted health care costs while also controlling for comorbidities, impairments, and death proximity. Annual health care costs increased from 80 years (A 2972 pound in men, A 2603 pound in women) to 97 (men; A 4721) pound or 98 years (women; A 3963) pound, before declining. Costs were significantly elevated in the last year of life but this effect declined with age, from A 10,027 pound in younger octogenarians to A 7021 pound in centenarians. This decline was steeper in participants with comorbidities or impairments; A 14,500 pound for 80-84-year-olds and A 6752 pound for centenarians with 7+ impairments. At other times, comorbidity and impairments, not age, were main drivers of costs. We conclude that comorbidities, impairments, and proximity to death are key mediators of age-related increases in health care costs. While the costs of comorbidity among survivors are not generally associated with age, additional costs in the last year of life decline with age.","[Hazra, Nisha C.; Gulliford, Martin C.] Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Guys Campus,3rd Floor Addison House, London SE1 1UL, England; [Rudisill, Caroline] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England; [Gulliford, Martin C.] Guys & St Thomas Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,"Hazra, NC (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Guys Campus,3rd Floor Addison House, London SE1 1UL, England.",nisha.hazra@kcl.ac.uk,"Rudisill, Caroline/IUO-5377-2023; Gulliford, Martin/I-8606-2018","Gulliford, Martin/0000-0003-1898-9075; Hazra, Nisha/0000-0002-1424-6525",Dunhill Medical Trust [R392/1114]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,Dunhill Medical Trust(Dunhill Medical Trust); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,This work was supported in part by the Dunhill Medical Trust [Grant number: R392/1114].

Prior to 2009, all recorded (roll call) votes in the European Parliament had to be requested explicitly by European Political Groups. Since 2009, a roll call vote has been mandatory on all final legislative votes. We exploit that change in the rules and compare differences between final legislative votes, amendment votes and non-legislative votes before and after 2009, using a difference-in-differences approach with extensive controls. Using data from the Sixth (2004-2009) to Seventh (2009-2014) European Parliaments, we fail to find any large differences in voting cohesion for the main political groups. We find even less significance when we control for changes in parliamentary membership between those two periods. The results suggest that selection biases in the European Parliament associated with strategic choices are negligible.","[Hix, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Noury, Abdul] New York Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Roland, Gerard] Univ Calif Berkeley, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Roland, Gerard] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Noury, A (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",S.Hix@lse.ac.uk; agn2@nyu.edu; groland@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Hix, Simon/0000-0002-3116-5292",,,,,42,16,19,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176,1-2,,,SI,,211,228,,10.1007/s11127-018-0529-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11127-018-0529-1,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000438459400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Employing Jaimovich-Rebello preferences our results highlight a constraint on the preference parameter needed to target the steady-state Frisch elasticity. This leads to a lower bound for the latter that cannot be reconciled empirically with external habit, but the introduction of a labor wedge solves the problem.

We ask whether there exists an optimal firm size for which leverage is not negatively related to firm performance. Accordingly, with a panel data of 101 listed firms in Nigeria between 2003 and 2007, we explore whether the ultimate effect of leverage on firm performance is contingent on firm size, that is, whether the type of impact that leverage has on the performance of a firm is dependent on the size of the firm. Our results show that the negative effect of leverage on firm performance is most eminent and significant for small-sized firms and that the evidence of a negative effect diminishes as a firm grows, eventually vanishing when firm size exceeds its estimated threshold level. We find that this result continues to hold, irrespective of the debt ratios utilized In line with earlier studies, our results show that the effect of leverage on Tobin's Q is positive for Nigeria's listed firms However, our new finding is the evidence that the strength of the positive relationship depends on the size of the firm and is mostly higher for small-sized firms.","[Ibhagui, Oyakhilome W.] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Olokoyo, Felicia O.] Covenant Univ, Dept Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",University of Kent; Covenant University,"Ibhagui, OW (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",wallace@aims.ac.za; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Olokoyo, Felicia O./M-8193-2013",,,,,,28,113,116,8,62,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

However, planning of cycling infrastructures in large cities faces numerous challenges and requires better understanding of both the factors enabling cycling as well as barriers to it, determined by particular local context. While there is a growing body of research that tackle the bike transport related questions in Western Europe and the USA, there is relatively little research on that in Central Eastern Europe (CEE), in post-communist countries. In this study we used qualitative and quantitative methods to explore urban cyclists and non-cyclists opinions about the cycling, the perceived problems and obstacles, and perception of the on-going changes in bicycle transportation system in Warsaw, Poland. Although many people see potential advantages of cycling, it is mostly perceived as a leisure time activity. Those who do utilitarian cycling are more acutely aware of the benefits, such as rapidity and flexibility of this mean of transport. The main perceived barriers are linked to lack of good cycling infrastructure in the city, the feeling of insecurity linked to the behaviour of drivers, and to maintenance during winter. In conclusion, our research highlights both the opportunities and challenges linked to the development of improved cycle transportation system, suggesting the need for a range of policies, from the infrastructure improvements and comprehensive planning of the whole transportation system, to improving the driving culture that would support feeling of security of the cyclists.","[Iwinska, Katarzyna] Coll Civitas, PKIN, Pl Defilad 1, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland; [Blicharska, Malgorzata] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Nat Resources & Sustainable Dev, Villavaen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Pierotti, Livia; de Nazelle, Audrey] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 13 G7 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Tainio, Marko] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, MRC Epidemiol Unit, UKCRC Ctr Diet & Act Res CEDAR, Cambridge, England; [Tainio, Marko] Polish Acad Sci, Syst Res Inst, Ul Newelska 6, PL-01447 Warsaw, Poland",Uppsala University; Imperial College London; University of Cambridge; Polish Academy of Sciences; Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Iwinska, K (通讯作者)，Coll Civitas, PKIN, Pl Defilad 1, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland.",kiwinska@collegium.edu.pl; malgorzata.blicharska@geo.uu.se,"Iwińska, Katarzyna/AAC-7336-2022; Iwinska, Katarzyna/ABA-6131-2020","Iwińska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7337-915X; Iwinska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7337-915X; Tainio, Marko/0000-0002-0973-2342; de Nazelle, Audrey/0000-0002-1092-3971","Collegium Civitas, Warsaw; Coca-Cola Foundation; AGAUR; CREAL; British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research; Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration; MRC [MR/K023187/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Collegium Civitas, Warsaw; Coca-Cola Foundation; AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); CREAL; British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was supported by Collegium Civitas, Warsaw.

The Dominican Republic (DR) is used as case study as it provides a highly interesting context to analyse this issue. The majority of its immigrants come from neighbouring Haiti, and together the two countries share the island of Hispaniola. The analysis relies on a novel municipality panel dataset and an instrumental variable strategy to address the endogeneity of the location decisions of immigrants. I find robust evidence that higher immigrant concentration causes greater support for the right-wing political coalition that has traditionally been more opposed to immigration. At the same time, the popularity of the centre coalition is found to decline in localities characterised by a larger exposure to foreigners. Empirical evidence from election outcomes and opinion survey data suggests that citizenship, political competition and cultural identity considerations might be shaping individual attitudes towards immigrants in the DR.","[Jaupart, Pascal] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Jaupart, Pascal] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Jaupart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Jaupart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, 120 Walton St, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",pascal.jaupart@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,,London School of Economics,London School of Economics,"I am indebted to Steve Gibbons and Olmo Silva for continued guidance and supervision.

The article suggests that inter-state mobility is inhibited by state-level entitlement schemes, ranging from access to subsidized goods through the public distribution system to the bias for states' own residents in access to tertiary education and public sector employment.","[Kone, Zovanga L.] Univ Oxford, COMPAS, 58 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England; [Liu, Maggie Y.; Mattoo, Aaditya; Ozden, Caglar; Sharma, Siddharth] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Liu, Maggie Y.] Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",University of Oxford; The World Bank; Smith College,"Ozden, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cozden@worldbank.org,,,Knowledge for Change Program; Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change Program; Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program of the World Bank,"We would like to thank the Data Dissemination Unit, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India for preparing the data tables from the 2001 Census under a special administrative agreement with the World Bank.

We are specifically concerned with poverty alleviation because we consider this an urgent problem of justice. We review empirical literature on social trade-offs in ecosystem services governance in order to identify the prevalent conceptions of justice that inform scholarly assessments of current practice. We find that empirical studies do present specific notions of justice as desirable benchmarks for ecosystem services governance but that they rarely attempt to spell out the precise meaning of these notions or what makes them desirable. For those notions of justice that we identify in this literature - sufficientarianism, egalitarianism and participatory approaches - we draw on philosophical justice literature in order to better articulate the normative arguments that could support them and to be more precise about the kind of actions and expectations that they invoke. Moreover, we point to some striking normative silences in the ecosystem services literature. We conclude that the ecosystem services justice discourse would benefit from more conceptual clarity and a broader examination of different aspects of justice.","[Lehmann, Ina] Univ Bremen, Artec Sustainabil Res Ctr, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Martin, Adrian] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Global Environm Justice Grp, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Fisher, Janet A.] Univ Edinburgh, Geog & Lived Environm GeoSci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Bremen; University of East Anglia; University of Edinburgh,"Lehmann, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Artec Sustainabil Res Ctr, Enrique Schmidt Str 7, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",ina.lehmann@uni-bremen.de; adrian.martin@uea.ac.uk; janet.fisher@ed.ac.uk,,,Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) Programme [NE/M007103/1]; UK Department for International Development; UK Economic and Social Research Council; UK Natural Environment Research Council; NERC [NE/M007103/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) Programme; UK Department for International Development; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) Programme, grant number NE/M007103/1.

A surprising and yet key feature of these large and apparently liquid markets is that they seem to be bound up with the widespread use of mathematical valuation and risk management models by market participants. The paper investigates derivative models and risk management by highlighting the grounds for their emergence, their establishment and their influence on market developments. A political economy of derivatives markets provides insights into the essential nature of derivatives, defining them against the material circumstances in which they arise, and allows the logical development of valuation models and risk management as the necessary complement to the large-scale derivatives markets that have developed since the 1980s. The paper builds from finding prices for potential new trades to valuing completed trades and risk managing portfolios to show how and why valuation models and risk management are bound up with today's derivatives markets.","[Lindo, Duncan] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Lindo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",duncanlindo@yahoo.co.uk,"Lindo, Duncan/AAD-4626-2019","Lindo, Duncan/0000-0002-7847-6442",,,,,83,5,5,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Improving the livelihoods of environmental services (ES) suppliers is not only seen as a side benefit but is often considered a prerequisite for the viability of PES. Yet, the ability to draw 'overview lessons' over the impacts of PES on livelihoods from literature review studies remains limited. To overcome these shortcomings, we undertake a meta-analysis of causal statistical studies on the effects of PES on the livelihoods of ES suppliers in the developing world. The set-up of our meta-analysis allows us to draw more conservative but more reliable and generalisable overview lessons. Our findings suggest that PES programmes are likely to have positive but modest livelihood impacts on ES suppliers. Further, several institutional characteristics of PES are found to be correlated with more favourable livelihood impacts, such as high payments, high degree of voluntary participation, low transaction costs and better access to alternative income sources. Lastly, our results highlight the importance of controlling for unobservable confounders when undertaking original evaluation studies on the impacts of PES. These factors should be incorporated in the design, implementation and evaluation of PES.","[Liu, Zhaoyang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Peking University; University of Cambridge,"Kontoleon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ak219@cam.ac.uk,"LIU, Z/AAD-2255-2020","LIU, Z/0000-0003-0124-0113",,,,,104,37,40,4,92,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We argue that an appropriate analytical segmentation stage should integrate and trade off different available information sources. In particular, it should consider the actual time series patterns, in addition to the variables that characterize the drivers behind the patterns observed. The simultaneous consideration of both information sources, without prior assumptions regarding the relative importance of each, leads to a multicriteria formulation of the segmentation stage. Here, we demonstrate the impact of such an adjustment to segmentation on the final forecasting accuracy of the cross-sectional multi-state Kalman filter. In particular, we study the relative merits of single and multicriteria segmentation stages for a simulated data set with a range of noise levels. We find that a multicriteria approach consistently achieves a more reliable recovery of the original clusters, and this feeds forward to an improved forecasting accuracy across short forecasting horizons. We then use a US data set on income tax liabilities to verify that this result generalizes to a real-world setting. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It tests the hypothesis that the various manufacturing industries exhibit different values of the Verdoorn coefficient and hence different degrees of increasing returns, broadly defined. The paper analyses especially whether or not these estimates vary according to the level of a country's economic development, controlling for such factors as human capital and the level of technology. It is found that this is the case. Countries in the early stages of development would benefit from specialising in low-tech manufacturing and consumption goods, as these industries have larger Verdoorn coefficients than in the more developed countries. However, as countries reach higher stages of development, it is advantageous for them to specialize in the high-tech manufacturing industries and the capital goods industries. These have relatively high values of the Verdoorn coefficient compared with the less developed countries. It is concluded that the composition of industries that leads to the fastest growth of manufacturing productivity differs depending upon the level of economic development.","Univ Cambridge Rua Para, Dept Land Econ, 126-Apt 51, BR-01243020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Magacho, Guilherme R.; McCombie, John S.

No detectable change in the consumption patterns of Indonesian households appears from our analysis, suggesting that rural areas in Indonesia could absorb the sudden increase in the availability of workforce.

Donors, who are ideologically aligned with candidates, decide how much to contribute to their own candidate. They may benefit from rent-seeking by their own candidate but dislike rent-seeking by the opposition. Increased rent-seeking by politicians thus generates campaign contributions for themselves but also mobilizes donations to the opposing candidate, potentially to a greater extent. This latter effect acts as a deterrent to rent-seeking when contributions finance electoral campaigns and positively affect election chances. When political competition is low, incumbent donors outnumber opposition donors, and limits reduce rent-seeking. When political competition is high, donors are equalized and laissez-faire reduces rent-seeking. Consistent with these hypotheses, data from the USA suggest that limits are associated with better policies and stronger growth performance at low levels of political competition, while laissez-faire is preferred when political competition is high.","[Maloney, John] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Pickering, Andrew] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Exeter; University of York - UK,"Maloney, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",,,,,,,,49,1,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85,339,,,,,479,517,,10.1111/ecca.12260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecca.12260,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000434412400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, British researchers, official policymaking bodies and NGOs have put forward the notion of 'transport poverty', building on an implicit analogy between (recognised) fuel poverty and (neglected) transport affordability issues. However, the conceptual similarities and differences between 'fuel' and 'transport' poverty remain largely unaddressed in the UK. This paper systematically compares and contrasts the two concepts, examining critically the assumption of a simple equivalence between them. We illustrate similarities and differences under four headings: (i) negative consequences of lack of warmth and lack of access; (ii) drivers of fuel and transport poverty; (iii) definition and measurement; (iv) policy interventions. Our review suggests that there are important conceptual and practical differences between transport and domestic energy consumption, with crucial consequences for how affordability problems amongst households are to be conceptualised and addressed. In a context where transport and energy exhibit two parallel policy worlds, the analysis in the paper and these conclusions reinforce how and why these differences matter. As we embark on an ever closer union between our domestic energy and transport energy systems the importance of these contradictions will become increasingly evident and problematic. This work contributes to the long-term debate about how best to manage these issues in a radical energy transition that properly pays attention to issues of equity and affordability.","[Mattioli, Giulio; Lucas, Karen; Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Room 104,34-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JU, W Yorkshire, England.",g.mattioli@leeds.ac.uk,"Mattioli, Giulio/J-7314-2019; Mattioli, Giulio/JCF-0799-2023","Mattioli, Giulio/0000-0003-1309-554X; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme [EP/M008096/1]; EPSRC [EP/M008096/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work arises from the research project Energy-related economic stress in the UK, at the interface between transport, housing and fuel poverty, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/M008096/1) as part of the RCUK Energy Programme.

This paper proposes a novel, disaggregated approach to investigating vulnerability to such increases at the household level. We propose a set of indicators of 'car-related economic stress' (ORES), based on individual household level expenditure data for the UK, to identify which low-income households spend disproportionately on running motor vehicles, and to assess the depth of their economic stress. By subsequently linking the dataset to local fuel price data, we are able to model the disaggregated price elasticities of car fuel demand. This provides us with an indicator of each household's adaptive capacity to fuel price increases. The findings show that 'Low Income, High Cost' households (LIHC) account for 9% of UK households and have distinct socio-demographic characteristics. Interestingly, they are characterised by very low responses to fuel price increases, which may cause them to compromise on other important areas of their household expenditures. Simulations suggest that a 20% increase in fuel prices would substantially increase the depth, but not the incidence of CRES. Overall, the study sheds light on a sector of the population with high levels of vulnerability to fuel price increases, owing to high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. This raises challenges for social, environmental and resilience policy in the transport sector.","[Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio; Lucas, Karen] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wadud, Zia] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Ctr Integrated Energy Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wadud, Zia] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",G.Mattioli@leeds.ac.uk; Z.Wadud@leeds.ac.uk; K.Lucas@leeds.ac.uk,"Wadud, Zia/A-6025-2012; Mattioli, Giulio/J-7314-2019; Mattioli, Giulio/JCF-0799-2023","Mattioli, Giulio/0000-0003-1309-554X; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme [EP/M008096/1]; EPSRC [EP/M008096/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme (grant no.

There is, however, remarkably little empirical evidence on self-consumption. This paper begins to address this gap by analysing one-minute electricity monitoring data for 302 households that participated in a UK smart grid demonstration project. We calculate annual self-consumption levels and find that they are 855 kWh/year per household on average, or 45% of PV generation. We conduct a simple regression analysis to estimate self-consumption and use the results to show that self-consumption for an average UK household with electricity demand of 4000 kWh/year and 2.9 kWp PV system would be 966 38 kWh/year, equivalent to a 24% reduction in average annual electricity demand from the grid. Our methodology can be readily applied to measure and predict self-consumption in other solar markets as well, which has increasingly important implications for valuing solar investments, setting feed-in tariffs, and examining the impacts of PV on networks and retail sales.","[McKenna, Eoghan; Darby, Sarah J.] UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Pless, Jacquelyn] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Eagle House,Walton Well Rd, Oxford OX2 6ED, England",University of London; University College London; University of Oxford,"McKenna, E (通讯作者)，UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",e.mckenna@ucl.ac.uk,,,Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Oxford Martin School through the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy.

Model estimation is performed using linear quantile regression. An empirical analysis is conducted on 18 market indices. In spite of the simplicity of the proposed methods, the empirical results show that they successfully capture the main features of the financial returns and are competitive with established benchmark methods.

We argue that this claim conflates time consistency with two distinct properties of preferences: stationarity and time invariance. While time invariance and stationarity together imply time consistency, the converse does not hold. Although non-dictatorial social preferences cannot be stationary, they may be time consistent if time invariance is abandoned. If individuals are discounted utilitarians, revealed preference provides no guidance on whether social preferences should be time consistent or time invariant. Nevertheless, we argue that time invariant social preferences are often normatively and descriptively problematic. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The Gravity model here differs from the Classical model in assuming imperfect competition and a positive effect of total trade on productivity. We found that the Classical model passed the test comfortably, and that the Gravity model also passed it but at a rather lower level of probability, though as the test power was raised it was rejected. The two models' policy implications are similar.","[Minford, Patrick; Xu, Yongdeng] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales; [Minford, Patrick] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England",Cardiff University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Minford, P (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.;Minford, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England.",Minfordp@cf.ac.uk; Xuy16@cf.ac.uk,,"Xu, Yondeng/0000-0001-8275-1585; Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X",,,,,13,7,7,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, attempts to substitute or control nature through efficient bio-based technology have not lived up to expectations and much of the industry still relies on globally sourced biomass to drive the bioeconomy. This article examines the social and political economic relations surrounding small-scale production of the feedstock castor oil plant (castor, Ricinus communis) in the deep south of Madagascar. Theorizing the bioeconomy through the lens of a small-scale commodity frontier, it builds from recent injunctions by Jason Moore to show how the appropriation of cheap nature (including paid and unpaid labour) is both historically and geographically co-produced. The castor value chain is held up as a way to transform regional economies and a silver bullet to alleviate poverty and address food security in some of the most economically marginal areas of Madagascar. We adopt a regional and feminist political ecology approach to illustrate what is behind this discursive cloak of development imaginaries, making visible the social relations surrounding castor production and demonstrating the historical marginalization involved in producing the frontier.","[Neimark, Benjamin D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Healy, Timothy M.] Aquaterre, BP 1541, Antananarivo, Madagascar",Lancaster University,"Neimark, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",b.neimark@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Neimark, Benjamin/0000-0003-3229-0869",National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration [9222-12],National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration(National Geographic Society),The National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration funded the work on biofuels in Madagascar (The Human dimensions of Environmental Change and Biofuel Production).

Framing regards the way in which messages are worded concerning a particular object. In many consumer markets such as train journeys, firms frame messages in both positive and negative lights to persuade individuals to make purchase decisions (take intended journeys). We thus go beyond the literature's current focus on consumer-generated content (CGC), and bring into contention the important role that marketer-generated content (MGC) plays in shaping the social media-based consumer relationship management (CRM) strategies. Specifically, we analyze commuter tweets about 14 train operators, along with the companies' Twitter feeds. The findings, obtained using sentiment analysis tools, suggest that consumer sentiments only moderately impact travel performance, as measured by operator ratings, CPM (consumer performance measure; a measure based on travel incidents) and firm financial performance. On the other hand, it appears that train operators use tweets in relation to their services particularly well, while keeping customers engaged by listening to and learning from criticism, thus confirming the moderating role of their Twitter-based message framing strategies. Train operators should look to maintain their social media use practices, ensuring they are consistently applied within an overarching CRM framework, particularly in key 'pain' areas such as delay and cancellation.","[Nisar, Tahir M.] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Prabhakar, Guru] UWE, Fac Business & Law, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Southampton; Solent University; University of West England,"Nisar, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",t.m.nisar@soton.ac.uk; Guru.Prabhakar@uwe.ac.uk,,"Prabhakar, Guru/0000-0001-5516-9434",,,,,74,31,35,4,64,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Objectives: To contrast the value of external data on treatment effects as a selection aid in model fitting to the clinical data or for the direct extrapolation of survival. Methods: We assume the existence of external summary data on both treatment and control and consider two scenarios: availability of external individual patient data (IPD) on the control only and an absence of external IPD. We describe how the summary data can be used to extrapolate survival or to assess the plausibility of extrapolations of the clinical data. We assess the merit of either approach using a comparison of cemented and cementless total hip replacement as a case study. Merit is judged by comparing incremental net benefit (INB) obtained in scenarios with incomplete IPD with that derived from modeling external IPD on both treatment and control. Results: Measures of fit with the external summary data did not identify survival model specifications that best estimated INB. Addition of external IPD for the control only did not improve estimates of INB. Extrapolation of survival using the external summary data comparing treatment and control improved estimates of INB. Conclusions: Our case study indicates that summary data comparing treatment and control are more valuable than IPD limited to the control when extrapolating event rates for cost-effectiveness analysis. These data are best exploited in direct extrapolation of event rates rather than as an aid to select extrapolations on the basis of the clinical data.,"[Pennington, Mark] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, PO24 David Goldberg Ctr,De Crespigny Pk, London 5E5 8AF, England; [Grieve, Richard; Van der Meulen, Jan] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Hawkins, Neil] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Glasgow,"Pennington, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, PO24 David Goldberg Ctr,De Crespigny Pk, London 5E5 8AF, England.",mark.w.pennington@kcl.ac.uk,"Pennington, Mark/AAS-9946-2020","Pennington, Mark/0000-0002-1392-8700; Hawkins, Neil/0000-0003-3199-221X; van der Meulen, Jan/0000-0002-9451-2335; Grieve, Richard/0000-0001-8899-1301","Department of Health, UK","Department of Health, UK(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","This work was funded by the Department of Health, UK.",,47,7,7,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21,7,,,,,822,829,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.023,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005754,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000438314900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper compares three occupations in the housing sector with very different wage setting institutions: real estate agents, architects and construction workers. I study the wage and employment responses of these occupations to the housing cycle, a proxy for labour demand shocks to the industry. The employment of real estate agents, whose pay is far more flexible than the other occupations, indeed reacts less to the cycle than employment in the other occupations, although specific estimates are noisy. I show that the aggregate implications of the estimates depend also on the aggregate labour demand elasticity, which captures how easily laid off workers can find employment in alternative sectors.","[Pischke, Jorn-Steffen] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Pischke, JS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,"Pischke, Jorn-Steffen/0000-0002-6466-1874",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1]; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I thank Alexander Lembke, Georg Graetz and Felix Koenig for excellent research assistance, and two referees, Carol Jordan, Alan Manning, Guy Michaels, Albert Saiz and Orie Shelef for helpful comments.

Unlike all previous studies that use time invariant linear models, our approach reveals that the pre 1600 period is a turbulent economic period of high volatility that is only repeated in the 20th century. The repeating patterns in the conditional volatilities follow from aggregate supply shocks, while most of the inflation responses follow from aggregate demand shocks. Thus, we uncover that despite the technological growth and the various changes in the structure of the U.K. economy in the last century, the recurring patterns call for an examination of the true impact of the various policies on the economy.

Yet, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) do not accurately understand treatment information provided in regular clinical consultations. Objectives: To identify the best methods of communicating clinical trial data to improve the understanding of treatments among patients with MS and to also examine the relationship between patients' understanding with decisional conflict, individual traits, and MS symptoms. Methods: A repeated-measures study was used. A sample of relapsing-remitting patients with MS was recruited from National Health Service sites in the United Kingdom. Patients were presented with hypothetical treatment risks and benefits from faux clinical trials. Treatments were communicated using absolute terms, relative terms, and numbers needed to treat/harm. The presence of baseline information with each method was also manipulated. Patients' understanding and conflict in treatment decisions were assessed. Individual traits and MS symptoms were also recorded. Results: Understanding was better when treatments were communicated in absolute terms (mean 3.99 +/- 0.93) compared with relative terms (mean 2.93 +/- 0.91; P < 0.001) and numbers needed to treat/harm (mean 2.89 +/- 0.88; P < 0.001). Adding baseline information to all methods significantly improved understanding (mean 5.04 +/- 0.96) compared with no baseline information (mean 1.50 +/- 0.74; P < 0.001). Understanding was not related to conflict in treatment decisions (r = -0.131; P = 0.391). Numeracy, IQ and cognitive impairments were significantly related to patients' understanding of treatments. Conclusions: Treatment risks and benefits should ideally be communicated using absolute terms, alongside baseline information. Patients with MS with low numeracy, low IQ and reduced cognitive skills should be supported during treatment education.","[Reen, Gurpreet K.; Langdon, Dawn W.] Univ London, Dept Psychol, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Silber, Eli] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Neurol, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,"Reen, GK (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Psychol, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",gurpreet.reen.2014@live.rhul.ac.uk,,"langdon, dawn/0000-0003-1128-7417",Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),"This study was supported by an investigator-initiated research grant from Biogen.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the CS for BARI was based predominantly on three randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of BARI against adalimumab or placebo, as well as one long-term extension study. The clinical-effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of BARI against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the company performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: one in patients who had experienced an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (cDMARD-IR), and the other in patients who had experienced an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi-IR). The company's NMAs concluded BARI had comparable efficacy as the majority of its comparators in both populations. The company submitted a de novo discrete event simulation model that analysed the incremental cost-effectiveness of BARI versus its comparators for the treatment of RA from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in four different populations: (1) cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA, defined as a 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) > 3.2 and no more than 5.1; (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA (defined as a DAS28 > 5.1); (3) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) was eligible; and (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated. In the cDMARD-IR population with moderate RA, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BARI in combination with MTX compared with intensive cDMARDs was estimated to be 37,420 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the cDMARD-IR population with severe RA, BARI in combination with MTX dominated all comparators except for certolizumab pegol (CTZ) in combination with MTX, with the ICER of CTZ in combination with MTX compared with BARI in combination with MTX estimated to be 18,400 pound per QALY gained. In the TNFi-IR population with severe RA, when RTX in combination with MTX was an option, BARI in combination with MTX was dominated by RTX in combination with MTX. In the TNFi-IR population with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated, BARI in combination with MTX dominated golimumab in combination with MTX and was less effective and less expensive than the remaining comparators. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after applying corrections to the methods used in the NMAs and two programming errors in the economic model that affected the company's probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) results. The ERG's NMA results were broadly comparable with the company's results. The programming error that affected the PSA of the severe cDMARD-IR population had only a minimal impact on the results, while the error affecting the severe TNFi-IR RTX-ineligible population resulted in markedly higher costs and QALYs gained for the affected comparators but did not substantially modify the conclusions of the analysis. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that BARI in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in patients with severe RA, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX-eligible.","[Ren, Shijie; Bermejo, Inigo; Simpson, Emma; Wong, Ruth; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Lifespan & Chron Illness Res, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; University of Hertfordshire,"Ren, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",s.ren@sheffield.ac.uk,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/56/23],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 16/56/23).

Levels of trust and trustworthiness are likely to depend on social utility; the magnitude of which is influenced by the social context governing individual relationships. Social networks are an example of such a social context. This paper investigates how social networks influence trust and trustworthiness by blending social network analysis with experimental economics methodology in two separate experiments. We show that trust and trustworthiness are higher for individuals who are more closely connected; in both cases, this relationship tapers off beyond second degree friendships. We also find that people tend to trust more central (popular) individuals. However, being more central (popular) has little influence on one's levels of trust and trustworthiness. We find these effects on trust to be only partially driven by the expectation of trustworthiness. We thus document evidence of a bias toward more closely connected and more popular individuals.

This paper addresses this empirical gap with reference to the EU's promotion of regulatory reforms in three economic sectors in Egypt: agriculture, banking and telecoms. It finds that these reforms are significantly, if selectively, informed by ordoliberal principles and practices. Two theoretical implications of this finding are explored. On the one hand, while this substantiates the institutional isomorphism hypothesis, for which the EU tends to export its own models elsewhere, the selectivity with which this occurs demonstrates greater instrumentality than usually maintained in this literature. On the other hand, understanding ordoliberalism as a variation within the neoliberal template shaping restructuring in Egypt, this paper moves beyond binary views of regulatory co-operation and competition and thus also enriches debates on the EU as a global regulator.","[Roccu, Roberto] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Roccu, R (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Int Polit Econ, Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6LE, England.",roberto.roccu@kcl.ac.uk,,"Roccu, Roberto/0000-0003-3542-5765",European Research Council (ERC) [263277],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Research for this article was carried out in the framework of the research project 'BORDERLANDS: Boundaries, Governance, and Power in the European Union's Relations with North Africa and the Middle East', funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant Agreement Number 263277 and directed by Raffaella Del Sarto.

We use data drawn from government records from 1929 to 1939 which report the mean heights of boys and girls in school at each age (6-18) for each of Japan's 47 prefectures. We focus on two key questions: (1) how important was the disease environment in infancy in shaping the growth pattern of children? and (2) were shocks to child health more salient in the first thousand days of life, often held as a critical window to prevent stunting, or at later ages? We quantify the characteristics of the growth pattern of birth cohorts using the SITAR growth model and then relate the predicted SITAR parameters to infant mortality in the year of birth. In addition, we test for instantaneous effects of morbidity, proxied by infant mortality, on growth at ages 6-11. We find that infant mortality in early life did not have a strong influence on the growth pattern of children, but there were statistically significant and economically meaningful instantaneous effects of infant mortality on child height at ages 6-11 for both boys and girls. This suggests that interventions outside of the thousand-day critical window can be effective and that the secular increase in height in interwar Japan was more strongly influenced by cumulative responses to the health environment across child development rather than simply improvements in early life health.","[Schneider, Eric B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ogasawara, Kota] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Chiba University,"Schneider, EB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.b.schneider@lse.ac.uk,,"Schneider, Eric/0000-0001-7682-0126","ESRC [ES/L010267/2]; Tokyo Institute of Technology; JSPS KAKENHI [16K17153]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17153] Funding Source: KAKEN; ESRC [ES/L010267/1, ES/L010267/2] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Tokyo Institute of Technology; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors wish to thank Jean-Pascal Bassino, Tim Cole and Yukitoshi Matsushita, participants at the CEPR-NYUAD Economic History Workshop 2017, Fifth CEPR Economic History Symposium London, World Congress of Cliometrics Strasbourg, European Historical Economics Society Congress Tuebingen, Stunting: Past, Present and Future Conference London and Class, Gender and Childhood in Economic Development Conference Oxford and seminar participants at Hitotsubashi University and the University of Barcelona for helpful comments on the paper.

There has also been a strong, monotonic increase in co-authorship in economic history journals that roughly parallels general economics journals but sharply differs from leading history journals. Increased co-authorship cannot be explained by increasing use of econometrics or large data sets; rather, it is likely due to common changes in incentives facing economic historians and economists. Finally, co-authorships in economic history are more likely to be formed of individuals of different seniority compared to economics generally.","[Seltzer, Andrew J.] Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, London, England; [Seltzer, Andrew J.] IZA, Ilford, England; [Hamermesh, Daniel S.] IZA, Barnard Coll, Ilford, England; [Hamermesh, Daniel S.] NBER, Wakefield, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Royal Holloway University London,"Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, London Sch Econ, London, England.;Seltzer, AJ (通讯作者)，IZA, Ilford, England.",a.seltzer@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Energy sector reforms in non-OECD Asia are thus significant for global energy use, sustainability and socio-economic welfare. The region has experienced a slow and difficult reform path and after more than two decades of reform efforts it is time to take stock of their outcomes. Using a novel dataset assembled for this purpose for the period 1990-2013 for 17 non-OECD Asian countries, we apply instrumental variables regression techniques to several electricity sector reform outcome models. We find that the standard reform model has had limited benefits, largely due to sectoral heterogeneity and institutional endowments. We also show empirical evidence of the theoretical trade-offs between technical efficiency, economic and welfare objectives of reforms. The results call for rethinking of the effectiveness of reforms and awareness of the effects of key reform steps on different outcomes. This is useful for balancing the trade-offs among competing reform objectives.","[Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Nepal, Rabindra] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England",University of Oxford; Massey University; Durham University,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206",,,,,103,14,14,0,3,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2018,39,4,,,,,181,209,,10.5547/01956574.39.4.asen,http://dx.doi.org/10.5547/01956574.39.4.asen,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3NI,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000435202100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: To investigate the relationship of social care needs and well-being with a generic health status measure using multivariate regression. Methods: We empirically compared responses to health and well-being measures and social care needs from a cross-sectional data set of the general population (the Health Survey for England). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine whether social care needs measured by the Barthel index can be explained by health status as captured by the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) and two well-being measures-the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results: Our study found that poor overall scores for EuroQol visual analogue scale, EQ-5D index, GHQ-12, and WEMWBS indicated a need for social care. Investigation of the dimensions found that the EQ-5D dimensions self-care and pain/discomfort were statistically significantly associated with the need for social care. Two dimensions of the WEMWBS (been feeling useful and had energy to spare) were statistically significantly associated with the Barthel index, but none of the GHQ-12 dimensions were. Conclusions: The results show that the need for social care, which is dependent on the ability to perform personal day-to-day activities, is more closely related to the EQ-5D dimensions than the well-being measures WEMWBS and GHQ-12.","[Singh, Jeshika; Longworth, Louise] PHMR Ltd, Hlth Econ Pricing & Reimbursement, London NW1 8XY, England; [Singh, Jeshika; Pokhrel, Subhash] Brunel Univ London, Dept Clin Sci, Hlth Econ Res Grp, London, England",Brunel University,"Singh, J (通讯作者)，PHMR Ltd, Hlth Econ Pricing & Reimbursement, London NW1 8XY, England.",jeshikasingh@phmr.com,"Pokhrel, Subhash/AAO-8648-2020","Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Pokhrel, Subhash/0000-0002-1009-8553",EuroQol Foundation,EuroQol Foundation,"This study was funded by the EuroQol Foundation.

MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; TOTAL ERROR; CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; OPTIMAL STRATEGIES; CARE; SIMULATION; DISEASE; ASSAY,"Introduction Numerous factors contribute to uncertainty in test measurement procedures, and this uncertainty can have a significant impact on the downstream clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of testing strategies. Currently, however, there is no clear guidance concerning if or how such factors should be considered within Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) of tests. Objective The aim was to provide an introduction to key concepts in measurement uncertainty for the HTA community and to explore, via systematic review, current methods utilised within HTAs. Methods HTAs of in vitro tests including a model-based economic evaluation were identified via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) HTA database and key reimbursement authority websites. Data were extracted to explore the specific components of measurement uncertainty assessed and methods utilised. The findings were narratively synthesised. Results Of 107 identified HTAs, 20 (19%) attempted to assess components of measurement uncertainty: 15 did so via some form of pre-model assessment (such as a literature review or laboratory survey); four also included components within the economic model; and one considered measurement uncertainty within the model only. One study quantified the impact of measurement uncertainty on cost-effectiveness and found that this parameter significantly changed the results, but did not impact the overall decision uncertainty. Conclusion A minority of HTAs identified from this review used various approaches to assess and/or incorporate the impact of measurement uncertainty, indicating that these assessments are feasible. Uncertainty remains around best practice methodology for conducting such analyses; further research is required to ensure that future HTAs are fit for purpose.","[Smith, Alison F.; Hulme, Claire] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Alison F.; Messenger, Mike; Hulme, Claire] NIHR Leeds In Vitro Diagnost Cooperat IVDC, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Messenger, Mike] Univ Leeds, Leeds Ctr Personalised Med & Hlth, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hall, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Canc Res Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Edinburgh,"Smith, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Smith, AF (通讯作者)，NIHR Leeds In Vitro Diagnost Cooperat IVDC, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.f.c.smith@leeds.ac.uk,"Hulme, Charles/B-4115-2013","Smith, Alison/0000-0001-7709-1869; Hulme, Claire/0000-0003-2077-0419",NIHR [DRF-2016-09-084]; NIHR; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2016-09-084] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2016-09-084] Funding Source: researchfish,NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"AS is supported by an NIHR Doctoral Fellowship, DRF-2016-09-084.

This paper analyzes the performance of four such transnational energy and climate governance networks. In the realm of sustainable energy, our cases are the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC). In the climate sphere, we examine the effectiveness of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI). Using principles from governance and public administration about the effectiveness of institutions, we examine the extent to which four networks have contributed to improving governance outcomes in the spheres of climate and sustainable energy. Our evaluation focuses on the clarity of purpose, funding, institutional formality, efficacy, and level of resilience of these networks. Some differences notwithstanding, we find that the transnational governance networks generally fail to meet the criteria about what constitutes an effective institution.

Some emerging research presents gas network decarbonisation options as a tractable alternative to 'all-electric' scenarios that use electric appliances to deliver the traditional gas services such as heating and cooking. However, there is some uncertainty as to the technical feasibility, cost and carbon emissions of gas network decarbonisation options. In response to this debate the Sustainable Gas Institute at Imperial College London has conducted a rigorous systematic review of the evidence surrounding gas network decarbonisation options. The study focuses on the technologies used to generate biomethane and hydrogen, and examines the technical potentials, economic costs and emissions associated with the full supply chains involved. The following summarises the main findings of this research. The report concludes that there are a number of options that could significantly decarbonise the gas network, and doing so would provide energy system flexibility utilising existing assets. However, these options will be more expensive than the existing gas system, and the GHG intensity of these options may vary significantly. In addition, more research is required, particularly in relation to the capabilities of existing pipework to transport hydrogen safely.","[Speirs, Jamie; Balcombe, Paul; Martin, Jeanne; Brandon, Nigel; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Speirs, Jamie; Brandon, Nigel] Imperial Coll London, Royal Sch Mines, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BP, England; [Balcombe, Paul; Johnson, Erin; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Speirs, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England.;Speirs, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Royal Sch Mines, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2BP, England.",jamie.speirs@imperial.ac.uk,"Hawkes, Adam/F-6631-2012; Speirs, Jamie/ABD-8770-2020","Speirs, Jamie/0000-0002-6729-9831; Hawkes, Adam/0000-0001-9720-332X; , Paul/0000-0002-3490-0707",Royal Dutch Shell,Royal Dutch Shell(Royal Dutch Shell),The Sustainable Gas Institute is supported by funding from Royal Dutch Shell.,,63,67,70,0,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118,,,,,,291,297,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.069,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000435050000027,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focusses on Ph+ ALL. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG). This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the company's submission was derived from a phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-comparative study. Given the lack of comparative evidence, a naive indirect comparison was performed against re-induction chemotherapy comparing major cytogenetic response and complete remission. Best supportive care (BSC) was assumed to produce no disease response. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment for patients with Ph+ ALL. The company submitted a state transition model that analysed the incremental cost effectiveness of ponatinib versus re-induction therapy and BSC for the treatment of Ph+ ALL in patients whose disease is resistant to dasatinib, who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate or who have the threonine-315-isoleucine mutation. This population was further subdivided into those who were suitable for allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and those who were not. The company's revised economic evaluation, following the clarification process, estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in those suitable for allo-SCT of 31,123 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ponatinib compared with re-induction chemotherapy and 26,624 pound per QALY gained compared with BSC. For those for whom allo-SCT was unsuitable, the company-estimated ICER compared with BSC was 33,954 pound per QALY gained. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses that, when combined, produced a range in ICERs (due to uncertainty of the most appropriate overall survival function) of dominant (being less expensive and providing more QALYs) to 11,727 pound per QALY gained compared with re-induction chemotherapy and between 7892 pound and 31,696 pound per QALY gained compared with BSC for those in whom allo-SCT was suitable. For those in whom allo-SCT was not suitable, the ERG estimated that ponatinib was dominant. During the consultation period, the company agreed a revised patient access scheme (PAS) that reduced the ICER ranges to 7156 pound to 29,995 pound per QALY gained versus BSC and to less than 5000 pound per QALY gained versus re-induction chemotherapy. In people for whom allo-SCT was unsuitable, ponatinib dominated BSC. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of UK NHS resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.","[Stevenson, Matt; Pandor, Abdullah; Hamilton, Jean; Stevens, John; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Rawdin, Andrew; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Rowntree, Clare] Univ Wales Hosp, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales",University of Sheffield; Cardiff University,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/51/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 16/51/11).

Strategies have been differentiated over time, among regions, and in relation to specific political choices. The paper focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean in which different political approaches have been developed together with a quite different geographical level of characterisation, representing a significant case study to better understand how political and institutional intervention might incentivise local and/or foreign investors, shaping the organisation of the infrastructure network. Therefore, the current research analyses the transport-related projects included in the World Bank database on private participation in infrastructure (from 1980 to 2015) highlighting main patterns in terms of institutional, social and economic characteristics that might influence the investment in transport infrastructure in the Latin America and the Caribbean. Our panel analysis that includes data collected from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and local government websites shows a clear link between government strategies and the related outcome in terms of transport investments. In particular, in addition to the size of the investment, a positive (and significant) impact of being part of a regional organisation emerges, as well as the involvement of private companies.","[Tei, Alessio] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Ferrari, Claudio] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Genoa, Italy",Newcastle University - UK; University of Genoa,"Tei, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",alessio.tei@ncl.ac.uk; ferrari@economia.unige.it,"Ferrari, Claudio/L-4981-2019; Tei, Alessio/AAT-1791-2020","Ferrari, Claudio/0000-0002-4339-2871; Tei, Alessio/0000-0002-1430-828X",,,,,40,11,11,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Objective The objective of the study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of these drugs in patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type (i.e. non-mutated) metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Methods We constructed a partitioned survival model to evaluate the long-term costs and benefits of cetuximab and panitumumab combined with either FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan) vs. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI alone. The economic analysis was based on three randomised controlled trials. Costs and quality-adjusted lifeyears were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results Based on the evidence available, both drugs fulfil the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's end-of-life criteria. In the analysis, assuming discount prices for the drugs from patient access schemes agreed by the drug manufacturers with the Department of Health, predicted mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for cetuximab ? FOLFOX, panitumumab ? FOLFOX and cetuximab ? FOLFIRI compared with chemotherapy alone appeared cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's threshold of 50,000per pound quality-adjusted life-year gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments. Conclusion Cetuximab and panitumumab were recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, for use within the National Health Service in England.

Results of a case study for commuters in the Stockholm public transport system suggest that there are preference differences among public transport modes. We found that the value of time for train is lower than for bus and metro, and that it is higher for auxiliary modes than for the main mode. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for differences proportional to the in-vehicle time between bus and metro, suggesting that characteristics of invehicle time in these two modes are valued equally by the travellers. Nevertheless, unobserved preference for metro is higher than the preference for bus. Regarding the existence of a rail factor, we find evidence to support the hypothesis that rail-based modes have in fact a smaller time parameter (train) or higher alternative specific constant (metro), indicating that rail modes are preferable to bus, ceteris paribus.","[Varela, Juan Manuel Lorenzo; Borjesson, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Borjesson, Maria] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Linkoping, Sweden; [Daly, Andrew] ITS Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Royal Institute of Technology; VTI; University of Leeds,"Varela, JML (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",jmlv@kth.se,,"Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745; Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232; /0000-0003-4512-9054","Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA; Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET","Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA(Vinnova); Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET","We thank the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA, for funding, along with the Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET.",,28,12,13,1,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper analyses trends of intensification and expansion at the national level, particularly in the oil palm sector in Indonesia and Malaysia. Despite similar starting points and also comparable rates of increasing productivity and profit in this sector, both countries have developed almost opposite trajectories of land use. While both intensification and expansion has occurred in these countries, national indicators show that Malaysia has largely pursued intensification while Indonesia has overwhelmingly favoured expansion. Using the framework of the Jevons paradox, this paper contributes to the existing literature by arguing how and why political and social factors, rather than technology and market incentives, can better account for the differences between yield and land use efficiency in Indonesia and Malaysia today. The paper argues that expansion in Malaysia has been curtailed by the Malaysian government's pledge to maintain at least 50% forest cover in the late 1990s, coupled with a government supported corporate strategy of establishing plantations in Indonesia. Indonesia has made no such pledge, leading to expansionist policies focused on market creation and production goals with limited incentives for technology-driven intensification. It also notes however that in recent years, new socio-political developments in both countries may yet change this clear dichotomy of opposing land use strategies between these two countries, namely Sarawak's recent autonomous tendencies over land use and Indonesia's new leadership and international No Deforestation Peat and Exploitation (NDPE) commitments.","[Varkkey, Helena] Social Sci Univ Malaya, Fac Arts, Dept Int & Strateg Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Tyson, Adam] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna] Univ Indonesia Depok, Dept Int Relat, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Nusantara 2 Bldg,2nd Floor, Jawa Barat 16424, Indonesia",Universiti Malaya; University of Leeds; University of Indonesia,"Varkkey, H (通讯作者)，Social Sci Univ Malaya, Fac Arts, Dept Int & Strateg Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",helenav@um.edu.my; A.D.Tyson@leeds.ac.uk; shofwan.albanna@ui.ac.id,"Varkkey, Helena/IZP-8781-2023; Varkkey, Helena/K-7934-2012; Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna/AAU-5918-2020","Varkkey, Helena/0000-0002-4622-0450; Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna/0000-0002-9736-9677; Tyson, Adam/0000-0002-4458-6870",British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme [PM160069]; British Academy,British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme; British Academy,"This work was supported by the British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme (Award Reference Grant Number: PM160069).

The paper utilises new British data to analyse the cost side of this debate. Our data is unique in that we have cost data by route level for both the incumbent (corresponding to British franchises) and the open access operators, as opposed to only having cost data on the incumbent at the network level as in other countries. The open access operators are found to have comparable unit costs to franchised operators. This is unexpected considering the significant returns to density that benefit the larger franchised operators. This is subsequently found to be due to lower input prices and an 'open access business model' effect that outweigh any density disadvantages. Overall we find that there are negligible cost disadvantages of allowing open access operators to compete with franchised intercity operators.","[Wheat, Phill; Smith, Andrew S.

The dataset was derived from two clinical trials, the ZMILE study in the Netherlands and the SMILE study in the UK. In both studies, patients' quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE-31P was measured at baseline and 12 months follow-up. Spearman's correlations, effect sizes (EF) and standardized response means (SRM) were calculated for both the EQ-5D-5L and QOLIE-31P domains and sub scores. Mapping functions were derived using ordinary least square (OLS) and censored least absolute deviations models. A total of 509 patients were included in this study. Low to moderately strong significant correlations were found between both instruments. The EQ-5D-5L showed high ceiling effects and small EFs and SRMs, whereas the QOLIE-31P did not show ceiling effects and also showed small to moderate EFs and SRMs. Results of the different mapping functions indicate that the highest adjusted R (2) we were able to regress was 0.265 using an OLS model with squared terms, leading to a mean absolute error of 0.103. Results presented in this study emphasize the shortcomings of the EQ-5D-5L in epilepsy and the importance of the development of condition-specific preference-based instruments which can be used within the QALY framework. In addition, the usefulness of the constructed mapping function in economic evaluations is questionable.","[Wijnen, Ben F. M.; de Kinderen, Reina J. A.; Evers, Silvia M. A.

We contribute to the literature by evaluating the impact of smoking bans on well-being externalities among smokers and non-smokers as well as couples of different types of smokers. We exploit the policy experiment provided by the timing of the UK public smoking bans and measure well-being via the GHQ. We employ matching techniques combined with flexible difference-in-differences fixed effects panel data models on data from the British Household PanelSurvey. The joint use of matching with fixed effects specifications allows building more comparable treatment and control groups, producing less model-dependent results and accounting for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. We find that public smoking bans appear to have a statistically significant short-term positive impact on the well-being of married individuals, especially among women with dependent children. These effects appear to be robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests and are discussed in the light of the economic theory and recent evidence.","[Yang, Miaoqing] RAND Europe, Cambridge, England; [Zucchelli, Eugenio] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",RAND Corporation; RAND Europe; Lancaster University,"Yang, MQ (通讯作者)，RAND Europe, Cambridge, England.",,"Zucchelli, Eugenio/Z-4871-2019","Zucchelli, Eugenio/0000-0003-3883-5006; Yang, Miaoqing/0000-0001-7975-374X",,,,,64,3,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

A general equilibrium model is developed, and incorporates agricultural amenities as byproducts of agricultural production, water trade channels, and multiple water types. The premise is that until a decade ago, water policy in Israel was interlinked with agricultural land-use policy. Integrating a Monte-Carlo analysis, the model searches for a baseline minimum value of agricultural amenity that makes household, in the counterfactual scenario, indifferent between the administrative and market mechanisms. The minimum imputed value is around 109% agricultural output. The intuition is that the gains in economic welfare, from improved water use efficiency, are offset by the losses in social welfare due to a reduction in available agricultural amenities.","[Yerushalmi, Erez] Birmingham City Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",,"Yerushalmi, E (通讯作者)，Birmingham City Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",Erez.Yerushalmi@bcu.ac.uk,,"Yerushalmi, Erez/0000-0002-9421-9067",,,,,53,4,4,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The paper models and quantifies the break-even carbon price for mature zero-carbon electricity investments. It appears an attractive alternative given the difficulty of measuring the social cost of carbon, but modelling shows it extremely sensitive to projected fuel prices, the rate of interest, and the capital cost of generation options, all of which are very uncertain. This has important implications, and justifies combining a carbon price floor with suitable long-term contracts for electricity investments.","[Newbery, David] Univ Cambridge, EPRG, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Newbery, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, EPRG, Cambridge, England.",dmgn@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,9,10,1,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 22,2018,12,,,,,,,,201840,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-40,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-40,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GK6RF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000436316300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

But can the change in the marginal distribution of earnings on its own explain the rise in top income shares? Are top executives replacing capital owners in the group of top-income earners, or are we rather witnessing a fusion of top capital and top earnings? This paper proposes an extension of the copula framework and uses it for exploring the changing composition of top incomes. It illustrates that changes in top income shares can easily be decomposed into respective changes in the marginal distributions of labour and capital income and the changing association between the two types of income. An application using tax record data from Norway shows that the association between top labour and capital incomes grew stronger between 1995 and 2005 in the top half of the wage and capital income distribution, though it declined for the top 1% of capital income receivers. A gender decomposition demonstrates that the association of wage and capital incomes at the top is particularly striking for men, whilst women are largely under-represented in the top halves of the two marginal distributions.","[Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, ESOP, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Konigs, Sebastian] OECD Inst Labor Econ, Paris, France; [Konigs, Sebastian] IZA Inst Labour Econ, Bonn, Germany",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.;Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, ESOP, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",rolf.aaberge@ssb.no,,"Konigs, Sebastian/0009-0007-3471-5150",,,,,28,18,18,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

However, its subjective probability formulation, first elaborated by Savage, is linked to Ellsberg-like paradoxes and ambiguity aversion. This has led various scholars to work out non-Bayesian extensions of EUT which cope with its paradoxes and incorporate attitudes toward ambiguity. A variant of the Ellsberg paradox, recently proposed by Mark Machina and confirmed experimentally, challenges existing non-Bayesian models of decision-making under uncertainty. Relying on a decade of research which has successfully applied the formalism of quantum theory to model cognitive entities and fallacies of human reasoning, we put forward a non-Bayesian extension of EUT in which subjective probabilities are represented by quantum probabilities, while the preference relation between acts depends on the state of the situation that is the object of the decision. We show that the benefits of using the quantum theoretical framework enable the modeling of the Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes, as the representation of ambiguity and behavioral attitudes toward it. The theoretical framework presented here is a first step toward the development of a 'state-dependent non-Bayesian extension of EUT,' and it has potential applications in economic modeling.","[Aerts, Diederik] Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Leo Apostel Interdisciplinary Studies CLEA, Krijgskundestr 33, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium; [Haven, Emmanuel; Sozzo, Sandro] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Haven, Emmanuel; Sozzo, Sandro] Univ Leicester, Res Ctr IQSCS, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Sozzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.;Sozzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Res Ctr IQSCS, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",diraerts@vub.ac.be; eh76@le.ac.uk; ss831@le.ac.uk,"Haven, E./AAC-2273-2022; Aerts, Diederik/H-5408-2011","Sozzo, Sandro/0000-0003-4338-3737; Aerts, Diederik/0000-0003-2266-6658",,,,,60,14,15,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

I evaluate the performance of a weighted parallel trends (WPT) DD estimator in a Monte Carlo study and provide an application to a case study context in which a benchmark estimate exists.

For some peripheral country pairs, we even find some evidence of decoupling' of business cycles relative to the core countries but majority of marginal business cycle effects do not change much before and after the common currency. The former observation supports the plea for more Europe-wide macro-prudential regulation whereas the latter observation gives ammunition to those economists who always stress that the euro zone architecture is an unfinished business and that the conditions for an optimum currency area are not fulfilled.","[Ahmed, Jameel] State Bank Pakistan, Financial Stabil Dept, Karachi, Pakistan; [Chaudhry, Sajid M.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Straetmans, Stefan] Maastricht Univ, Limburg Inst Financial Econ LIFE, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Birmingham; Maastricht University,"Ahmed, J (通讯作者)，State Bank Pakistan, Financial Stabil Dept, Karachi, Pakistan.",,"Ahmed, Jameel/ABC-9250-2021","Ahmed, Jameel/0000-0002-6816-5640; Chaudhry, Sajid/0000-0001-8769-8920",Higher Education Commission of Pakistan,Higher Education Commission of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),Jameel Ahmed gratefully acknowledges research support from Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.,,77,9,9,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Concluding that the overstretched nature of concept has diluted its political effectiveness, the editors suggest instead a focus on precarization as a process, drawing from perspectives that focus on the objective conditions, as well as subjective and heterogeneous experiences and perceptions of insecure employment. Framed in this way, they present a summary of the contributions to the special issue spanning a range of countries and organizational contexts, identifying key drivers, patterns and forms of precarization. These are conceptualized as implicit, explicit, productive and citizenship precarization. These forms and patterns indicate the need to address precariousness in the realm of social reproduction and post-wage politics, while holding these in tension with conflicts at the point of production.

In our model, education quality and student outcomes are determined endogenously by the interaction of parents, schools and policy-makers deciding educational resources. Immigration decisions are based on economic factors, immigration policy, as well as on parental motivation (parents' concerns about their children education achievement). The model yields results that are consistent with central empirical regularities of the school effects of immigration: (1) there is a negative effect of immigrant pupils on native students; (2) the increasing shares of immigrant students are associated with the decline of school resources and quality; (3) the school performance of immigrant children is positively associated with immigration costs; and (4) school achievement increases in parental motivation and those immigrant children with highly motivated parents tend to outperform native children. Importantly, our analysis clarifies under which conditions these empirical regularities take place and emphasizes that the effect of immigration on native pupils is mediated by the way the school system reacts to changes in class composition.","[Albornoz, Facundo] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Albornoz, Facundo] CONICET IIEP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cabrales, Antonio] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Hauk, Esther] CSIC, IAE, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Campus UAB, Barcelona, Spain",University of Nottingham; University of London; University College London; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.;Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，CONICET IIEP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",facundo.albornoz@nottingham.ac.uk; a.cabrales@ucl.ac.uk; esther.hauk@iae.csic.es,"Cabrales, Antonio/AAC-1805-2020","Cabrales, Antonio/0000-0003-0209-0399; Hauk, Esther/0000-0002-3089-9307; Albornoz, Facundo/0000-0001-8123-0550",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through CICYT from the project government of Catalonia [ECO2012-37065],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through CICYT from the project government of Catalonia,"We thank Paula Calvo for excellent research assistance.

We assess the patterns of financial contagion by sector and by country. Our results support the existence of financial contagion in all business sectors under the GFC and the ESDC. Financials and Telecommunications are the most affected, while the Industrials and the Consumer Goods the least in each crisis respectively.

In this article, the concept of extended supplier networks is introduced to address this gap by explicitly looking at how all stages of production are connected. The extended supplier network model that is presented provides an analytical framework that enables multiple scales of analysis in the study of sustainability challenges.","[Alexander, Rachel] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Alexander, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London, England.",r.alexander@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,16,18,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

In this paper we provide new evidence about the long-run evolution of top wealth shares for the United Kingdom. The new series covers a long period - from 1895 to the present- and has a different point of departure from the previous literature: we start with the analysis of the distribution of estates left at death. We find that the application to the estate data of mortality multipliers to yield estimates of wealth among the living does not substantially change the degree of concentration over much of the period both in the UK and US, allowing inferences to be made for years when this method cannot be applied. The results show that wealth concentration in the UK remained relatively constant during the first wave of globalization, but then decreased dramatically in the period from 1914 to 1979. The UK went from being more unequal in terms of wealth than the US to being less unequal. However, the decline in UK wealth concentration came to an end around 1980, and since then there is evidence of an increase in top shares, notably in the distribution of wealth excluding housing in recent years. We investigate the triangulating evidence provided by data on capital income concentration and on reported super fortunes.","[Alvaredo, Facundo] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] INET, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, Nuffield Coll, London, England; CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Morelli, Salvatore] CUNY, Stone Ctr Socioecon Inequal, New York, NY USA",Paris School of Economics; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，INET, Oxford, England.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England.",alvaredo@pse.ens.fr,"Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00023]; European Research Council [340831]; ESRC/DFID [ES/I033114/1]; University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC) [340831] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); ESRC [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Institute for New Economic Thinking; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC/DFID(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We acknowledge financial support, at different stages, from the Institute for New Economic Thinking (F.

This paper aims to address this question by estimating the causal effects of English language skills on education, health and fertility outcomes of immigrants in England and Wales. We construct an instrument for language skills using age at arrival in the United Kingdom, exploiting the phenomenon that young children learn languages more easily than older children. Using a unique individual-level dataset that links the 2011 Census data to life event records, we find that better English language skills significantly improve educational attainment and adult health, and affect fertility behaviour, but do not affect child health. Supplementary analysis suggests that a higher educational attainment as a result of better English language skills is a possibly important channel though which English proficiency affects immigrant health.

Having one or the other is likely to affect economic outcomes in ways that are unintended when the electoral rules are approved. In this paper, we show that government fragmentation has large fiscal implications. We also provide results that have a causal interpretation. Using a panel of Spanish municipalities, along with a close-elections regression discontinuity design, we find that single-party majorities run budgets with a 1.5% point larger primary surplus than that of coalitions. In addition, we show that lower deficits are driven mainly by single-party majority governments' capacity to raise more revenues. These findings are robust to several model specifications.","[Artes, Joaquin] Univ Complutense, Dept Appl Econ 4, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Jurado, Ignacio] Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Complutense University of Madrid; University of York - UK,"Jurado, I (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jartes@ucm.es; ignacio.jurado@york.ac.uk,,"Jurado, Ignacio/0000-0003-2439-3817","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2013-40870-R, CSO2017-82881-R]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Albert Falco-Gimeno, Elias Dinas, Sandra Leon, Jeffrey Timmons, Didac Queralt, Pedro Riera, and Gilles Serra for helpful comments on previous drafts of this paper.

J,"Atkinson, AB",,,,"Atkinson, Anthony B.",,,Wealth and inheritance in Britain from 1896 to the present,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wealth; Inheritance; Estate data,ESTATE DUTY,"Personal wealth has grown since the 1970s twice as fast in real terms as national income. Has this rise in the wealth-income ratio led to a corresponding increase in the wealth being passed on from one generation to the next? Are we returning to the levels of inheritance found in the 19th century? The aim of this paper is to construct UK evidence on the extent of the transmission of wealth in the form of estates and gifts inter vivos. It takes a long-run view of inheritance, starting from 1896, when the modern Estate Duty was introduced, and exploits the extensive estate data published over the years. Construction of a long-run time series for more than a century is challenging, and there are important limitations. The resulting time-series demonstrates the major importance of inheritance in the UK before the First World War, when the total transmitted wealth represented some 20 per cent of net national income. In the inter-war period, the total was around 15 per cent, falling to some 10 per cent after the Second World War, and then falling further to below 5 per cent in the late 1970s. Since then, there has indeed been an upturn: a rise from 4.8 per cent in 1977 to 8.2 per cent in 2006. This increase was more or less in line with the increase in personal wealth, and has to be interpreted in the light of the changing net worth of the corporate and public sectors of the economy.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",richard.t.atkinson@icloud.com,,,ESRC/DFID [ES/I033114/1]; Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00023],ESRC/DFID; Institute for New Economic Thinking,This research was stimulated by the work of Thomas Piketty on France (2011).

A great deal is known about gender differentials in earnings, but how far does this carry over to total incomes? This paper investigates the gender divide at the top of the income distribution using tax record data for eight countries with individual taxation. It shows that women are strongly under-represented at the top of the distribution. Although the presence of women at the top has increased over time, the rise becomes smaller at the very top. The income gradient by gender has become more marked. The paper also shows that income composition differs by gender and exhibits significant changes over time, underlining the fact that it is not sufficient to look only at earned income.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Casarico, Alessandra] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Germany; [Casarico, Alessandra] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Casarico, Alessandra] Dondena Res Ctr Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Voitchovsky, Sarah] Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Voitchovsky, Sarah] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ifo Institut,"Casarico, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Milan, Germany.;Casarico, A (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Casarico, A (通讯作者)，Dondena Res Ctr Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy.",alessandra.casarico@unibocconi.it; sarah.voitchovsky@unimelb.edu.au,"Voitchovsky, Sarah/O-6788-2014",,INET (Oxford); Swiss National Science Foundation,INET (Oxford); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This article has been written in co-operation with Facundo Alvaredo, Jorgen Modalsli and Jakob Sogaard who have supplied the results for Spain, Norway and Denmark, respectively.

The 2006 reform increased learning and reduced earning as school participation rose post-reform, while teen employment fell. Empirical analysis of detailed administrative data reveals that criminal offending fell significantly after enactment of the reform. For males, violent, property and drug crime all declined, while the main effect for females was a significant fall in property crime. The property and drug crime falls are underpinned by a significant incapacitation effect, with some evidence of a persistent crime reduction for young men and women at later ages. Crime reduction resulting from the reform is concentrated in significant falls in the likelihood of ever offending by marginal individuals, rather than lower criminality of recalcitrant persistent offenders.

Half of London's boroughs, as well as neighborhoods in several other cities, were impacted through the more than 200 individual riot events that caused 200 pound ($300) million in property damage. Despite widespread media coverage at the time, we know little about what citizens experienced during the riots. This paper bridges that gap using daily response panel data (from the Mappiness smartphone application) to estimate the beyond-monetary costs of the riots. Based on the difference-in-differences estimation, the disturbances substantially increased unhappiness and stress in areas they affected. This negative effect was even more pronounced in areas with the biggest proportion of Black residents, and it also reached a national scale, as even neighborhoods without riots experienced a pronounced wellbeing loss. The negative effects persisted beyond the end of the disturbances, at least until the end of the summer. Citizens changed their behavior in response to the events, respondents in neighborhoods with riots started seeking information and communicating more, which manifested in higher levels of TV watching, texting, email, and social media use. The English riots form part of a larger trend in current social tensions-with a marked wellbeing loss for the majority of Brits.","[Bencsik, Panka] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Bencsik, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",p.bencsik@sussex.ac.uk,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018",,,,,,31,4,4,0,5,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

Yet as a distinct financial device it has received little attention. The question is why it seems, in many contexts, to be preferred over standard life insurance even though the latter is a more flexible product. This paper presents a simple model in which funeral insurance differs from life insurance in that there is a constraint on how the payout is spent. Funeral insurance can therefore serve as an intergenerational commitment device. The model's key prediction is consistent with South African household data.","[Berg, Erlend] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Berg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",erlend.berg@bristol.ac.uk,,,Research Council of Norway; British Academy,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); British Academy,I thank the Research Council of Norway and the British Academy for financial support and the South African Advertising Research Foundation for giving me access to their data.,,52,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Many such services are provided by monopoly not-for-profit providers and there is concern that for-profit providers may increase profit at the expense of quality. This paper explores the implications of entry by for-profit providers when there is unobserved quality. The model generates three key policy relevant insights. First, by developing a novel approach to competition between different organizational forms, it frames the relevant trade-offs precisely. Second, it shows the value of keeping an incumbent not-for-profit as an active provider. Third, it characterizes the optimal payment (or voucher value) to an entrant for each consumer who switches in a way that can be applied empirically. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that this may explain the relationship between executive constraints and inflows of foreign investment. It uses a novel dataset of Dutch sector-level investments between 1983 and 2012 to explore this issue. It formulates an economic model of investment and uses data on the mean and variance of productivity growth to explain the relationship between investment inflows and executive constraints. The model can account for the aggregate change in inflows when strong executive constraints are adopted in terms of the reduction in the volatility in productivity growth. The data and model together suggest a natural way of thinking about country-level heterogeneity in investment inflows following the adoption of strong executive constraints.,"[Besley, Timothy] LSE, London, England; [Besley, Timothy] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mueller, Hannes] CSIC, IAE, Madrid, Spain; [Mueller, Hannes] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics,"Besley, T (通讯作者)，LSE, London, England.;Besley, T (通讯作者)，CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada.",t.besley@lse.ac.uk; h.mueller.uni@gmail.com,"Mueller, Hannes/ABC-1470-2020","Mueller, Hannes/0000-0001-7667-3971",IGC; Ramon y Cajal programme; MINECO/FEDER [ECO2015-66883-P]; MINECO through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563],IGC; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government); MINECO/FEDER; MINECO through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD,"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

While both Britain and the US have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in Britain while it has risen in the US. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the US and on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the US mean this growing group has seen particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.

In this context, this study focuses on the legal nature of an agreement, which is linked to audience costs primarily at the domestic level that occur in case of non-compliance and are felt especially by democracies. Eventually, more legalized (hard-law) treaties make compliance potentially more challenging and as democratic leaders may anticipate the corresponding audience costs, the likelihood that democracies select themselves into such treaties decreases. The empirical implication of our theory is that environmental agreements with a larger share of democratic members are less likely to be characterized by hard law. Results from quantitative analyses strongly support our argument, shed new light on the relationship between participation in international agreements and the form of government, and also have implications for the words-deeds debate in international environmental policy-making.","[Bohmelt, Tobias] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Butkute, Edita] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Essex; University of London; University College London,"Böhmelt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",tbohmelt@essex.ac.uk; edi.btk@gmail.com,"Böhmelt, Tobias/N-5347-2014",,,,,,67,10,10,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It has been shown how these size distortions can be resolved using the wild bootstrap. In this paper, we first derive the asymptotic power envelope for the unit root testing problem when the non-stationary volatility process is known. Next, we show that under suitable conditions, adaptation with respect to the volatility process is possible, in the sense that non-parametric estimation of the volatility process leads to the same asymptotic power envelope. Implementation of the resulting test involves cross-validation and the wild bootstrap. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that the asymptotic results are reflected in finite sample properties, and an empirical analysis of real exchange rates illustrates the applicability of the proposed procedures.","[Boswijk, H.

Second, we estimate their models for different time periods and find that the impact of genetic distance on income differences did not significantly change over time.

We assume that each player is either in a friendly or in an antagonistic relation with every other player and players compete for winning by exerting costly efforts. We axiomatically characterize a success function which determines the win probability of each player given the efforts and the network of relations. In an extension, we allow for varying intensities of friendships and enmities. This framework allows for the study of strategic incentives and friendship formation under conflict as well as the application of stability concepts of network theory to contests.

This paper provides evidence on the use of this concept in European Commission merger decisions. We find that it has been relatively rarely used. However, where it has, maverick behaviour has been considered in a diverse range of industries and the candidate firms have been both insiders and outsiders to the merger. We then examine in detail the few cases where the existence of a maverick was eventually established by the Commission. All of these cases occurred after the 2004 change in the Merger Regulation and predominantly when analyzing the likelihood that unilateral effects would result from the merger. We suggest that this may be reconciled with economic theory by a more general need to take into account post-merger product repositioning.","[Bromfield, Joseph] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Olczak, Matthew] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; Aston University,"Bromfield, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.p.bromfield@bham.ac.uk; m.olczak@aston.ac.uk,,"Olczak, Matthew/0000-0001-6808-3832",,,,,18,4,5,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK's pioneering SPI adjustment' method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of very rich' individuals are adjusted using information from very rich' individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality.

Despite this, at the time of writing this report, limited regulatory guidance on the use of wearables in clinical trial programs has been published. Objectives: To present recommendations from the Critical Path Institute's Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Consortium regarding the selection and evaluation of wearable devices and their measurements for use in regulatory trials and to support labeling claims. Methods: The evaluation group was composed of Critical Path Institute's clinical outcome assessment (COA) scientists and COA specialists from pharmaceutical trial eCOA solution providers, including COA development and validation specialists. The resulting recommendations were drawn from a broad range of backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise that enriched the development of this report. Recommendations were developed through analysis of existing regulatory guidance relating to COA development and use in clinical trials, medical device certification/clearance regulations, literature-reported best practice, and practical experience of wearable technology application in clinical trials. Results: We identify the essential properties of fit-for-purpose wearables and propose evidence needed to support their use. In addition, we overview the activities required to establish clinical endpoints derived from wearables data. Conclusions: Using this framework, we believe there is enough current understanding to promote the appropriate use of wearables in study protocols. We hope this will provide a basis for discussion among clinical trial stakeholders and catalyze the development of more robust regulatory guidance.","[Byrom, Bill] ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England; [Watson, Chris] ERT, Nottingham, Notts, England; [Doll, Helen; Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Coons, Stephen Joel; Eremenco, Sonya; Crescioni, Mabel] Crit Path Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Mc Carthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Donohoe, Paul] CRF Hlth, London, England; [Howry, Cindy] AssisTek, Scottsdale, AZ USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; ICON plc,"Byrom, B (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England.",bill.byrom@iconplc.com,,"Crescioni, Mabel/0000-0002-9366-3078; Mc Carthy, Marie/0000-0003-2730-0233",Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [U18 FD005320]; ePRO Consortium,Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; ePRO Consortium,"Critical Path Institute (C-Path) is supported, in part, by Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships Grant Number U18 FD005320 (effective 2015-2020) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In particular, it investigates whether monetary policy in these countries can be more accurately described by (i) an augmented rule including the exchange rate, as well as (ii) a nonlinear threshold specification (estimated using GMM), instead of a baseline linear rule. The results suggest that the reaction of monetary authorities to deviations from target of either the inflation or the output gap differs in terms of the size and/or statistical significance of the coefficients in the high and low inflation regimes in all countries. In particular, the exchange rate has an impact in the former but not in the latter regime.

This paper analyses the effectiveness of a garbage tax, assessing its effects on multiple outcomes as well as its acceptability. We study how a Supreme Court decision, mandating the Swiss Canton of Vaud to implement a tax on garbage, affects garbage production and beliefs about the tax. We adopt a difference-in-differences approach exploiting that parts of Vaud already implemented a garbage tax before the mandate. Pricing garbage by the bag (PGB) is highly effective, reducing unsorted garbage by 40%, increasing recycling of aluminium and organic waste, without causing negative spillovers on adjacent regions. The effects of PGB seem very persistent over time. Our assessment of PGB looks very favourable. It may surprise that PGB is not implemented more often. Hence, we look at people's perceptions. We find that people are very concerned with PGB ex ante. Public opposition seems to be the main obstacle to PGB. However, implementing PGB reduces concerns with effectiveness and fairness substantially. After implementing PGB, people accept 70% higher garbage taxes compared to before PGB. We argue that environmental taxes could be much more diffused, if people had the chance to experience their functioning and correct their beliefs.","[Carattini, Stefano] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Baranzini, Andrea] HES SO Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Delemont, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, London, England; [Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Carattini, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",stefano.carattini@yale.edu,"Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019; Carattini, Stefano/AAK-5053-2021","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Carattini, Stefano/0000-0003-1242-2457; Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SKP1_165028]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SKP1_165028] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank Jeroen van den Bergh, Richard Blundell, Antoine Dechezlepretre, William Greene, Richard Howarth, Emilio Padilla, Jordi Roca, Frederic Vermeulen, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Constitutional provisions supporting economic freedom are our measure of the institutional context, whereas we proxy psychological characteristics with a country's endowment of agency culture. We apply an IV-GMM treatment to deal with endogeneity to a data set comprising 86 countries over the period 2004-2013, and we control for de facto variables and other factors that are likely to influence entrepreneurship. Our results demonstrate that agency culture is indeed an important predictor of entrepreneurship and that this effect is moderated by constitutional provisions supporting economic freedom. In particular, the impact of agency culture on entrepreneurship becomes stronger as a country expands the constitutional protection of economic rights.","[Carbonara, Emanuela; Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy; [Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Hien Thu Tran] Edge Hill Univ, FAS Business Sch, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England; [Potter, Jeff] Atof Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Bologna; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Edge Hill University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Melbourne; Melbourne Bioinformatics,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy.",emanuela.carbonara@unibo.it; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it; martin.obschonka@gut.edu.au; hine.tran@edgehill.ac.uk; jeffpotter@cookingforgeeks.com; samg@austin.utexas.edu,"Tran, Hien/HTM-2982-2023; Gosling, Sam/AAL-5718-2020","Gosling, Sam/0000-0001-8970-591X; Tran, Hien/0000-0002-1399-9146; Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166; SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755",Saarland University within the framework of the program EXIST-Culture of Entrepreneurship-The Entrepreneurship University,Saarland University within the framework of the program EXIST-Culture of Entrepreneurship-The Entrepreneurship University,"The authors thank Tom Ginsburg for providing us with the data from the Comparative Constitutions Project, Jerg Gutmann and an anonymous reviewer for helpful suggestions.

This is a noticeable change since usually mathematical frameworks focus on one large trader facing a background noise (or mean field). In standard frameworks, the interactions between the large trader and the price are a temporary and a permanent market impact terms, the latter influencing the public price. In this paper the trader faces the uncertainty of fair price changes too but not only. He also has to deal with price changes generated by other similar market participants, impacting the prices permanently too, and acting strategically. Our MFG formulation of this problem belongs to the class of extended MFG, we hence provide generic results to address these MFG of controls, before solving the one generated by the cost function of optimal trading. We provide a closed form formula of its solution, and address the case of heterogenous preferences (when each participant has a different risk aversion). Last but not least we give conditions under which participants do not need to instantaneously know the state of the whole system, but can learn it day after day, observing others' behaviors.","[Cardaliaguet, Pierre] PSL Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, CEREMADE, Pl Marchal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] CFM, Paris, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] Imperial Coll, London, England",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Imperial College London,"Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，CFM, Paris, France.;Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, London, England.",c.lehalle@imperial.ac.uk,,"LEHALLE, Charles-Albert/0000-0002-9978-9501","ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ANR-14-ACHN-0030-01, ANR-16-CE40-0015-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-ACHN-0030] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Authors thank Marc Abeille for his careful reading of Sect. 3.2.1.

We propose and use a new decomposition strategy to measure the contribution of early childhood and school influences to the cognitive gap between urban and rural eight-year-old children in Peru. This strategy accounts for the relation between family choices and skill inputs and is less prone to biases than those employed before. We find that school influences occurring between ages 6 and 8, account for a significant share of urban/rural cognitive gap (around 35%). The share attributable to early childhood influences is important but no larger than 50%. Because skill depreciates, only a fraction of the gap (70-80%) is carried forward to the next period. Therefore, inequalities in school environments are sustaining a cognitive gap that would otherwise be smaller and this explains why differences that emerge during early childhood can remain unchanged after children start school.","[Castro, Juan F.] Univ Pacifico, Av Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru; [Rolleston, Caine] UCL, 20 Bedford Way, London, England",Universidad del Pacifico Peru; University of London; University College London,"Castro, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Av Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru.",castro_jf@up.edu-pe,,"Rolleston, Caine/0000-0002-4564-4331; Castro, Juan/0000-0003-2032-0565",,,,,39,9,10,1,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Pivotal in setting Rwanda on the path to universal health coverage (UHC) is the community-based health insurance (CBHI), which covers more than three-quarters of the population. The paper seeks to explain how Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in the world, managed to achieve such performance by understanding the political drivers behind the CBHI design and implementation. Using an analytical framework relying on political settlement and ideas, it engages in process-tracing of the critical policy choices of the CBHI development. The study finds that the commitment to expanding health insurance coverage was made possible by a dominant political settlement. CBHI is part of the broader efforts of the regime to foster its legitimacy based on rapid socio-economic development. Yet, CBHI was chosen over other potential solutions to expand access to healthcare because it was also the option the most compatible with the ruling coalition core ideology. The study shows that pursuing UHC is an eminently political process but explanations solely based on objective interests of rulers cannot fully account for the emergence and shape of social protection programme. Ideology matters as well. Programme design compatible with the political economy of a country but incompatible with ideas of the ruling coalition is likely to run into political obstructions. The study also questions the relevance for poor countries to reach UHC relying on pure CBHI models based on voluntary enrolment and community management. (C) 2018 The Author.

This study aims to explore the strategic fit of potential mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese banking industry. When the operations of two banks are jointly analyzed this means that the inputs and the outputs of these two individual banks are somehow combined in an attempt to better understand the sector as a whole. A novel SFA model with Bayesian inference on input/output prices is proposed to assess the impact of business-related variables on efficiency levels. The results not only reveal that bank size, type, and origin present a significant impact on individual technical efficiency levels, but also exert a significant impact on the efficiency frontier of the industry. The strategic fit of M&As in the Chinese banking industry strongly relies on opportunities derived from banking automation that may arise from acquiring technologically obsolete small banks. Big and foreign banks also exert a positive impact on the technological catch-up of Chinese banks, which may suggest opportunities for sector deregulation.","[Chen, Zhongfei] Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wanke, Peter] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Sch Business, Ctr Studies Logist Infrastruct & Management, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Chen, Zhongfei] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Lancaster University; Athens University of Economics & Business; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hongyeczf@163.com; peter@coppead.ufrj.br; m.tsionas@lancaster.ac.uk,"Chen, Zhongfei/L-2323-2019; Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020; Wanke, Peter/G-3184-2010","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Wanke, Peter/0000-0003-1395-8907","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71704065]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620022]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2016A030310083, 2017A030310003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","We thank the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant No. 71704065], the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Grant No. 2017M620022] and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [Grant No. 2016A030310083, Grant No. 2017A030310003].",,50,8,8,0,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Their boundaries are hard to pin down and intrinsically fuzzy. Nevertheless, policymakers often speak or act as if their definition was self-evident. The Dutch and later the British governments, for example, introduced very specific policies for them without ever clearly defining what or where they were. In this article, we propose a simple methodology to predict TC boundaries and extent. Using a range of micro-geographical data, we test our method for the whole of Great Britain in an attempt to capture all the dimensions of 'town centredness' in a 3D surface. We believe this is a contribution in its own right but is also an essential step if there is to be any rigorous analysis of TC or evaluation of policies directed at them. Our method should contribute to improve not just debates about cities, shopping hierarchies, and TCs but also to other more general debates where people and policy proceed ahead of any clear definition of what are the objects of interest.","[Cheshire, Paul; Hilber, Christian] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, London, England; [Cheshire, Paul; Hilber, Christian] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr SERC CEP, London, England; [Montebruno, Piero] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa] Imperial Coll Business Sch, London, England; [Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa] London Sch Econ, SERC CEP, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Cheshire, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, London, England.;Cheshire, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr SERC CEP, London, England.",p.cheshire@lse.ac.uk; c.hilber@lse.ac.uk; pfm27@cam.ac.uk; r.sanchis-guarner@imperial.ac.uk,"Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa/Z-5057-2019; Montebruno, Piero/M-9796-2018","Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa/0000-0003-2744-0551; Montebruno, Piero/0000-0001-8010-7446; Hilber, Christian/0000-0002-1352-495X",SERC/CEP [ES/M010341/1]; British Academy; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,SERC/CEP; British Academy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank SERC/CEP for funding (ESRC grant ES/M010341/1), and R.S.-G. acknowledges support from the British Academy.

Although broadly similar, the studies differ in how they identify the outcome equation. One approach uses conventional socio-economic variables as instruments for endogenous health care expenditure, whereas the other exploits exogenous elements in the resource allocation formula for local budgets. The former approach has usually been applied to specific disease areas (e.g., for cancer and circulatory disease), whereas the other has only been applied to all-cause mortality. In this letter, we compare the two approaches by using them to estimate the direct all-cause elasticity as well as disease-specific elasticities. We also calculate the implied all-cause elasticity associated with the disease-specific results. We find that the funding rule approach to identification can be successfully replicated and applied to disease area models. This is important because disease area models reduce the danger of aggregation bias present in all-cause analysis, and they offer the opportunity to link estimated mortality effects to more complete measures of health outcome that reflect what is currently known about the survival and morbidity disease burden in different programmes.","[Claxton, Karl; Lomas, James] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl; Martin, Stephen] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Martin, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sdm1@york.ac.uk,,,UK's Department of Health,UK's Department of Health,UK's Department of Health.,,5,22,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUN,2018,27,6,,,,,1017,1023,,10.1002/hec.3650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3650,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF0UN,29607571,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000431646700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The test is based on realized third moments, and uses observations over an increasing time span. The test offers an alternative to standard finite time span tests, and is designed to detect jumps in the data generating process rather than detecting realized jumps over a fixed time span. More specifically, we make two contributions. First, we introduce our largely model free jump test for the null hypothesis of zero jump intensity. Second, under the maintained assumption of strictly positive jump intensity, we introduce two self-excitement tests for the null of constant jump intensity against the alternative of path dependent intensity. These tests have power against autocorrelation in the jump component, and are direct tests for Hawkes diffusions (see, e.g. Ait-Sahalia et al. (2015)). The limiting distributions of the proposed statistics are analyzed via use of a double asymptotic scheme, wherein the time span goes to infinity and the discrete interval approaches zero; and the distributions of the tests are normal and half normal. The results from a Monte Carlo study indicate that the tests have reasonable finite sample properties. An empirical illustration based on the analysis of 11 stock price series indicates the prevalence of jumps and self-excitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

What is the joint effect of notification and training programs on unemployment? Can ignoring information shocks lead to a large bias in the estimation of the effect of training programs? We discuss these issues through the lens of a job search model and then conduct an empirical analysis following a random effects approach to deal with selectivity. We find that notification has a strong positive effect on the training probability but a negative one on the probability of leaving unemployment.

Two major rebel groups benefited from cash and in-kind transfers, the CNDD-FDD from 2004, and the FNL from 2010. We combine panel data of households collected in 2006 and 2010 with official records from the National Commission for Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration. We find that the cash payments received by FNL demobilized households had a positive impact on consumption, nonfood spending and investments. The program also generated positive spillovers in the villages where FNL combatants returned. Ex-combatants indeed spent a large part of their allowance on consumption goods and clothing, thereby generating a short-run economic boom in villages. However, the long-run evolution of consumption indicators is negative for CNDD-FDD households, as well as for villages where CNDD-FDD combatants returned, suggesting that the direct impact and the spillovers of the program vanished in the long run.","[D'Aoust, Olivia] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [D'Aoust, Olivia] ULB, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Sterck, Olivier] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England; [Verwimp, Philip] ULB, ECARES, Dev Econ, Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Oxford; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Sterck, O (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England.",odaoust@worldbank.org; olivier.sterck@economics.ox.ac.uk; wimp@ulb.ac.be,,,Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS); ARC [09/14-018]; MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework),Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); ARC(Australian Research Council); MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework)(European Union (EU)),"Olivia D'Aoust and Philip Verwimp acknowledge financial support from the Alain and Marie Philippson Chair and the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS).

This article investigates a duality in the exploratory component of R&D activity with regard to innovation failure: while exploration is likely to increase firms' exposure to failure, it might also provide learning opportunities to reduce failure. Our study contributes to the innovation management and organizational learning literatures by demonstrating the value of exploratory R&D for enabling two types of learning mechanisms. The first, experience-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from accumulated experience in exploratory R&D: it involves improvements to procedures associated with experimentation and provides guidance for current exploration and to navigate the search space. The second, inferential-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from current exploratory R&D efforts, which are associated with improved interpretation of ill-defined problems and timely responses to unstructured information. We draw on a longitudinal data set of 2226 Spanish manufacturing companies and show that, when past experience is associated with current exploration, innovation failure in the conception phase is reduced. We also find an inverted Ushaped relation between current exploratory R&D and innovation failure, in both the conception and implementation phases of innovation activities, showing that increasing levels of investment in current exploration activities attenuate the initial positive association between exploratory R&D and failure.","[D'Este, Pablo] Univ Politecn Valencia, INGENIO CSIC UPV, Inst Innovat & Knowledge Management, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Marzucchi, Alberto] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestion de la Innovacion y del Conocimiento (INGENIO); University of Sussex; University of Milan; University of Southampton; Solent University,"Rentocchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy.;Rentocchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",pdeste@ingenio.upv.es; a.marzucchi@sussex.ac.uk; f.rentocchini@soton.ac.uk,"Rentocchini, Francesco/A-5399-2009","Rentocchini, Francesco/0000-0002-6414-0577; D'Este, Pablo/0000-0002-4040-8209; Marzucchi, Alberto/0000-0002-4161-8734",,,,,98,27,27,8,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

R.",,,Influencing transport behaviour: A Bayesian modelling approach for segmentation of social surveys,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODES,"Current approaches for understanding and influencing transport behaviour often involve creating fixed, homogenous groups of similar surveyed individuals in order to explore specific behavioural profiles, an approach known as segmentation. Most commonly, segmentation is not based on a formal statistical model, but either a simple 'a priori' defined group classification narrative, failing to capture the complexity of varying group characteristics, or a 'post hoc' heuristic cluster analysis, applied to multidimensional behavioural variables, creating complex descriptive group narratives. Here, we present an alternative, Bayesian finite mixture-modelling approach. A clear group narrative is created by constraining the Bayesian prior to group survey respondents based on the predominance of a single apposing transport behaviour, while a detailed insight into the behavioural complexity of each group is achieved using regression on multiple additional survey questions. Rather than assuming within group homogeneity, this creates a dynamic group structure, representing individual level probabilities of group membership and within group apposing travel behaviours. This approach also allows for numerical and graphical representation of the characteristics of these dynamic, clearly defined groups, providing detailed quantitative insight that would be unachievable using existing segmentation approaches. We present an application of this methodology to a large online commuting behaviour survey undertaken in the city of Exeter, UK. Survey respondents are grouped based on which transport mode type they predominantly commute by, and the key drivers of these predominant behaviours are modelled to inform the design of behavioural interventions to reduce commuter congestion in Exeter. Our approach allows us to prioritise the most effective intervention themes, and quantify their potential effect on motor vehicle usage. For example, we identify that individuals that predominantly commute by public transport, but also sometimes motor vehicle, do so on average up to one day per week less often, if they are strongly concerned about the environment, demonstrating how an intervention to promote environmental awareness could greatly reduce motor vehicle usage within this group.","[Dawkins, L.

During phases of optimism, credit is abundant, access to production capital is easy, the cash-in-advance constraint is lax, risks are undervalued, and production is booming. Upon reversal in market sentiment, the contraction is quick and deep. More over, the model is capable of replicating the stylized fact of a long and sustained simultaneous growth in credit, production and asset prices observed in the US since mid1990's.

A structural VAR (SVAR) model and a time-varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) model are estimated, using six indicators that reflect economic and financial uncertainty. The findings of the study reveal that static frameworks (SVAR) do not show the full dynamics of the oil price shocks effects to the US economic/financial uncertainty. This is owing to the evidence provided by the time-varying framework (TVP-VAR), which convincingly shows that uncertainty responses to the three oil price shocks are heterogeneous both over time and over the different oil price shocks. In particular, uncertainty responses seem to experience a shift in the post global financial crisis period. Thus, the conventional findings that economic fundamentals response marginally, positively or negatively to supply-side, aggregate demand and oil specific demand shocks, respectively, do not necessarily hold at all periods. Rather, they are impacted by the prevailing economic conditions at each time period. The findings are important to policy makers and investors, as they provide new insights on the said relationships.","[Degiannakis, Stavros; Panagiotakopoulou, Sofia] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros] Hellen Open Univ, Postgrad Dept Business Adm, Aristotelous 18, Patras 26335, Greece; [Fills, George] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England",Panteion University; Hellenic Open University; Bournemouth University,"Fills, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019",,European Union [658494]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [658494] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"The authors would like to thank Prof. Paresh Narayan (Editor), Prof. Russell Smyth (Associate Editor) and the seven anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on a previous version of this paper.

Panel data for the country's commercial farms in 2001-2012 do not allow us to reject the hypothesis of constant returns to scale but point toward the importance of farms and rayon-(district) fixed effects. This suggests productivity growth was driven by exit of unproductive and entry of more efficient farms. Higher initial shares of area under farms above 3,000 or 5,000 ha at rayon level significantly reduce subsequent exit, pointing towards one channel through which land concentration may reduce productivity growth.","[Deininger, Klaus] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nizalov, Denys] Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Nizalov, Denys] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Singh, Sudhir K.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; Kyiv School of Economics; University of Kent; The World Bank,"Deininger, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",kdeininger@worldbank.org; nizalov@kse.org.ua; ssingh12@worldbank.org,"singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023","singh, sudhir/0000-0001-5267-665X; Nizalov, Denys/0000-0003-1510-4016; Deininger, Klaus/0000-0003-3198-0083",Department of Agricultural Statistics of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine,Department of Agricultural Statistics of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine,"We thank H.

The focus is on the allocation of self-employed individuals with different skill levels across sectors-primary, secondary and tertiary-and on its link to selectivity corrected returns to skills in these sectors. While self-employment is dominated by service sector activities and these activities attract more skilled individuals than do the manufacturing and primary sectors, the level of skills across all three entrepreneurial sectors is lower than that of both salaried workers and individuals who do not work. Returns to skills among self-employed individuals in the manufacturing sector are particularly low. This is at least partially explained by constraints to productive entrepreneurial activities and is inconsistent with the idea of smooth structural transformation towards innovative entrepreneurship.

Despite the substantial resources involved in providing these programmes, there is evidence that routine follow-up programmes do not affect survival or the likelihood of detecting recurrence and may not meet patient needs. Alternative follow-up modalities may offer the same outcomes at lower cost. We examined the costs of using telephone-based routine follow-up of women treated for endometrial cancer undertaken by specialist gynaecology oncology nurses in comparison to routine hospital-based follow-up. Methods The ENDCAT trial randomised 259 women at five centres in the north west of England with a known diagnosis of Stage I endometrial cancer who had completed primary treatment on a 1:1 basis to receive either standard hospital outpatient follow-up or a telephone follow-up intervention administered by specialist nurses. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken in which we compared costs to the health system and to individuals with the trial's co-primary outcomes of psychological morbidity and participant satisfaction with information received. Results Psychological morbidity, psychosocial needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life did not differ between arms. Patients randomised to telephone follow-up underwent more and longer consultations. There was no difference in total health service mean per patient costs at 6 months (mean difference 8 pound, 95% percentile confidence interval: - 147 pound to 141) pound or 12 months (mean difference: - 77 pound, 95% percentile confidence interval: - 334 pound to 154) pound. Estimated return journey costs per patient for hospital consultations were 11.47 pound. Productivity costs were approximately twice as high under hospital follow-up. Conclusion Telephone follow-up was estimated to be cost-neutral for the NHS and may free up clinic time for other patients. There was some evidence that telephone follow-up may be more efficient for patients and wider society, and is not associated with additional psychological morbidity, lower patient satisfaction or reduced quality of life.","[Dixon, Padraig; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Dixon, Padraig] Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Oakfield House, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England; [Beaver, Kinta; Williamson, Susan; Sutton, Chris; Martin-Hirsch, Pierre] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Martin-Hirsch, Pierre] Lancashire Teaching Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Preston PR2 9HT, Lancs, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; University of Central Lancashire,"Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.;Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Oakfield House, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England.",Padraig.Dixon@bristol.ac.uk; KBeaver@uclan.ac.uk; SWilliamson2@uclan.ac.uk; CJSutton@uclan.ac.uk; Martin.Hirsch@mac.com; William.Hollingworth@bristol.ac.uk,,"Sutton, Christopher/0000-0002-6406-1318; Beaver, Kinta/0000-0002-6552-2323; Dixon, Padraig/0000-0001-5285-409X; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254","National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme [PB-PG-0610-22123, 11016, 75220876]; Medical Research Council; University of Bristol [MC_UU_12013/1, MC_UU_12013/9]; Medical Research Council Skills Development Fellowship [MR/P014259/1]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0610-22123] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); University of Bristol; Medical Research Council Skills Development Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"The study was funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme (Grant Reference: PB-PG-0610-22123) (UKCRN ID: 11016; ISRCTN: 75220876).

Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Eckbo, B.

Conceptually, the paper employs social cognitive theory to explore the interplay between social learning, relational agency, and culture. This interplay builds the foundation for the development of an empowerment model of capacity building that proposes an interlinked system of community capacity and empowerment dimensions. The model is explored in the context of the Education for All project in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The research combines participant observation, qualitative interviews and visual methods to provide rich insights to situated knowledges of learning and empowerment. Findings reveal that the meaning of education equates to the capacity to aspire to a different life. This problematizes the way gender and gender relations are understood in the rural Berber villages. The girls' education unsettles the repeating cycle of female educational deprivation, and leads them to become role models within their communities. This instills the image of educated women in community consciousness, leading to an incipient change in perceptions of what girls and women can be and do. (C) 2018 The Authors.

While the existing literature explains the effect of networks on the outcomes of migrants through the size of the migrant community, we show that the quality of the network is an equally important determinant. We argue that networks that are more integrated in the society of the host country can provide more accurate information to future migrants about job prospects. In a decision model with imperfect signalling, we show that migrants with access to a better network are more likely to make the right decision, that is, they migrate only if they gain. We test these predictions empirically using data on recent Mexican migrants to the United States. To instrument for the quality of networks, we exploit the settlement of immigrants who came during the Bracero program in the 1950s. The results are consistent with the model predictions, providing evidence that connections to a better integrated network lead to better outcomes after migration.","[Elsner, Benjamin] Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Thijssen, Jacco] Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Trinity College Dublin; University of York - UK,"Elsner, B (通讯作者)，Inst Lab Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany.",elsner@iza.org; narcisog@tcd.ie; jacco.thijssen@york.ac.uk,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Thijssen, Jacco Johan Jacob/0000-0001-6207-5647; Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337",Irish Research Council for the Humanities & Social Sciences (IRCHSS),Irish Research Council for the Humanities & Social Sciences (IRCHSS),"We would like to thank the Editor, two anonymous referees, as well as Simone Bertoli, Herbert Brucker, Joanna Clifton-Sprigg, Tommaso Colussi, Margherita Comola, Christian Danne, Rachel Griffith, Joachim Jarreau, Julia Matz, Imran Rasul, Bas ter Weel, Mathis Wagner and seminar participants at IZA, University College Dublin, the University of Southern Denmark, as well as the conferences ISNE, TEMPO, IEA, ESEM, OECD immigration workshop, RES, NORFACE, ESPE, EALE, IZA/SOLE for helpful comments.

We used baseline data from a large-cluster randomized school trial to study the relationship between HRQoL, bullying experience, and other demographic factors. Cross-sectional self-reported questionnaires collected pre-randomization from the on-going INCLUSIVE trial. The questionnaires were completed in the classroom. The Gatehouse Bullying Scale measured bullying victimization and the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime school misbehavior subscale (ESYTC) measured aggressive behaviors. HRQoL was assessed using the Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions (CHU-9D) and general quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Participants were a cohort of year 7 students (age 11-12 years) from 40 state secondary schools in England. Descriptive statistics for the CHU-9D and PedsQL were calculated using standard methods with tests for differences in median scores by sex assessed using quantile regression. Correlation between HRQoL measures was conducted using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Predictors of HRQoL were identified using univariate and multiple regressions. A total of 6667 students filled out the questionnaire. The CHU-9D was correlated with the PedsQL (0.63, p < 0.001). The multivariable regression results suggest that if students were bullied frequently and upset it resulted in a decrement in CHU-9D scores of (-0.108) and fall in PedsQL score of (-16.2). The impact of the antisocial/aggressive behavior on the ESYTC scale resulted in a utility decrement of -0.004 and fall of -.5 on the PedsQL. Adolescents' involvement in bullying and aggression is a strong correlate of HRQoL. These data have important implications for the potential cost-effectiveness of reducing bullying and aggression in schools.","[Fantaguzzi, Catherine; Allen, Elizabeth; Miners, Alec; Christie, Deborah; Opondo, Charles; Sadique, Zia; Grieve, Richard; Bonell, Chris; Legood, Rosa] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Christie, Deborah] Univ Coll London Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Fletcher, Adam] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales; [Viner, Russell M.] UCL Inst Child Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; University College London; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Cardiff University; University of London; University College London,"Legood, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",c.fantaguzzi@imperial.ac.uk; elizabeth.allen@lshtm.ac.uk; alec.miners@lshtm.ac.uk; deborah.christie@uclh.nhs.uk; charles.opondo@lshtm.ac.uk; zia.sadique@lshtm.ac.uk; fletcher.a@cardiff.ac.uk; richard.grieve@lshtm.ac.uk; chris.bonell@lshtm.ac.uk; r.viner@ucl.ac.uk; rosa.legood@lshtm.ac.uk,"Legood, Rosa/GQZ-9121-2022; Viner, Russell/A-1441-2009","Legood, Rosa/0000-0003-2761-5227; Allen, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2689-6939; Opondo, Charles/0000-0001-8155-4117; Sadique, Zia/0000-0001-5814-0258; Grieve, Richard/0000-0001-8899-1301; Viner, Russell/0000-0003-3047-2247",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [12/153/60] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),The trial was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).

Such preference conformism would be worrying for an economics that takes individual preferences as given ('de gustibus es non disputandum'). So the test is important. But it is also difficult. People can behave alike for many reasons and the key to the design of our test, therefore, is the control of the other possible reasons for observing apparent peer effects. We find evidence of preference conformism in the aggregate and at the individual level (where there is heterogeneity).

However, empirical tests tend to ignore that the two levels are often nested in a hierarchy. Building on hierarchical growth curve modelling, we propose an approach to convergence analysis that allows contemporaneous inference on macro and micro-convergence. Compared to the classic linear convergence analysis, the suggested methodology provides a more flexible alternative to model heterogeneity and validate the results for possible Galton's fallacy. We illustrate the approach in two empirical examples, one considering convergence across European regions and countries and the other across Italian firms and regions. In the European case, we find that the evidence of convergence depends on the choice of cross-sectional sample. Evidence on convergence in Italy applies only to part of the temporal sample and, therefore, is not robust to Galton's fallacy. Our analysis returns more robust results on the convergence process and allows better inference for policy intervention.

Through theoretical and empirical research, this special issue aims to clarify the connection between geography and entrepreneurship. In doing so, growth strategies and change trajectories of countries, regions, and firms are analyzed. The papers use extensive data that enable the models to provide a rich picture of how academic institutions, companies, and regional governments contribute to regional development. As a result, these studies provide new perspectives on regional entrepreneurial transformation. Theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and their application to several contexts provide an advancement of our understanding about Geography and Entrepreneurship. Perspectives on R&D and knowledge, internationalization strategies, high-growth businesses, technological entrepreneurs, university spin-offs, transnational entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial networks are dominant themes included in this special issue. A brief description of the authors' contributions is offered to attract a broader readership.","[Ferreira, Joao J.] Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao J.] NECE Res Unit, Covilha, Portugal; [Carayannis, Elias G.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Campbell, David F.

We consider a disequilibrium macroeconomic model where agents' expectations on future capital gains affect aggregate demand. Agents' beliefs take two forms fundamentalist and chartist - and the relative weight of the two types of agents is endogenously determined. We show that there are two sources of instability arising from the interaction of the financial with the real part of the economy, and from the heterogeneous opinion dynamics. Two main conclusions are derived. On the one hand, perhaps surprisingly, the non-linearity embedded in the opinion dynamics far from the steady state can play a stabilizing role by preventing the economy from moving towards an explosive path. On the other hand, however, real-financial interactions and sentiment dynamics do amplify exogenous shocks and tend to generate persistent fluctuations and the associated welfare losses. We consider alternative policies to mitigate these effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we distinguish three dimensions of public adaptation: extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (coordination across territorial authorities and policy fields). Within each of these dimensions, we investigate how the self-interest of voters, pressure groups, bureaucrats and politicians may bias adaptation decisions. Thus, we indicate specific barriers to efficient public adaptation. Based on this framework, we illustrate how Germany's response to major flood disasters reflects the incentive structure of concerned stakeholders and their political interaction. The ad hoc character of some public adaptation measures implies a clear bias from the efficient benchmark. In conclusion, we argue that the propositions of Public Choice theory shed some light on how empirical public adaptation processes unfold.","[Gawel, Erik; Lehmann, Paul; Strunz, Sebastian; Heuson, Clemens] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Leipzig, Germany; [Gawel, Erik] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Lehmann, Paul] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; University of Oxford,"Gawel, E (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Leipzig, Germany.;Gawel, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.",erik.gawel@ufz.de; paul.lehmann@ufz.de; sebastian.strunz@ufz.de; c.heuson@gmx.de,"Lehmann, Paul/F-8207-2013; Strunz, Sebastian/N-3555-2015","Lehmann, Paul/0000-0001-7999-9125",,,,,85,4,5,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We examine a dynamic two country model calibrated to Greek and German economies and support two-steady states, one with endogenous default and one without, depending on creditors' expectations. In the default steady state, debt forgiveness lowers the volatility of both German and Greek consumption whereas demanding higher recovery rates has the opposite effect. In a second order approximation of the model, conditional welfare analysis shows that a policy of immediate leniency followed by harsher terms as the economy grows is beneficial to both creditors and debtors.

I find that funds in districts worse affected by blight experienced higher failure rates and greater credit retrenchment and flight-to-quality than funds in less affected districts. Though greater leverage was generally associated with a higher predicted probability of institutional survival, the reverse was true where blight infection was more severe, and though more profitable funds were generally no more likely to survive, higher pre-famine margins were positive predictors of institutional survival where blight infection was worse. Results further indicate that the primary mechanisms by which pre-famine balance sheet metrics influenced survival probabilities were differential balance sheet contraction and flight-to-quality during the famine. The results of this study, therefore, suggest that optimal lending models in ordinary circumstances may render microfinance institutions (MFIs) more vulnerable to tail-probability aggregate shocks, with higher leverage, lower paid staff, lower economic rents, and more extensive liabilities limiting the scope for credit retrenchment and flight-to-quality. Results further indicate that one cost of MFI resilience to adverse environmental change is substantially reduced outreach to borrowers of lower credit quality.","[Goodspeed, Tyler Beck] Univ Oxford, Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Goodspeed, TB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Econ, Oxford, England.",tyler.goodspeed@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,4,4,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This paper addresses this issue by examining how additional resources allocated to active labour-market policies relate to output-growth rates. It also examines the sensitivity of the growth-ALMP relationship to the business cycle. Based on a structural model, we find that whether or not additional resources allocated to ALMPs contribute to raising output growth is a priori unclear. However, using data from OECD countries during 1991-2011 and GMM estimation to account for potential endogeneities, we find evidence suggesting a net positive output-growth differential due to implementing active labour-market policies in normal times of between 0.004 and 0.006 percentage point.

Objectives: To develop these methods in different ways and to compare performance in a case study. Methods: Data from 856 patients with asthma allowed mapping between the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and both the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the health utilities index mark 3 (HUB). Adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models and beta-based mixture models were estimated. Optional inclusion of the gap between full health and the next value as well as a mass point at the next feasible value were explored. Results: In all cases, model specifications formally modeling the gap between full health and the next feasible value were an improvement on those that did not. Mapping to the HUB required more components in the mixture models than did mapping to the EQ-5D-5L because of its uneven distribution. The optimal beta-based mixture models mapping to the HUB included a probability mass at the utility value adjacent to full health. This is not the case when estimating the EQ-5D-5L, because of the low proportion of observations at this point. Conclusions: Beta based mixture models marginally outperformed adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models with the same number of components in this data set. Nevertheless, they require a larger number of parameters and longer estimation time. Both mixture model types closely fit both EQ-5D-5L and HUI data. Standard mapping approaches typically lead to biased estimates of health gain. The mixture model approaches exhibit no such bias. Both can be used with confidence in applied cost-effectiveness studies. Future mapping studies in other disease areas should consider similar methods.","[Gray, Laura A.; Alava, Monica Hernandez; Wailoo, Allan J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Alava, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",monica.hernandez@sheffield.ac.uk,"Gray, Laura/AAA-1430-2019","Gray, Laura/0000-0001-6365-7710; Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617",Medical Research Council [MR/L022575/1]; MRC [MR/L022575/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/L022575/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This study was supported by the Medical Research Council (grant no.

The model endogenises pricing decisions by firms, wage setting by unions and interest rate setting by banks on both firm and interbank lending. Banks also set leverage targets and precautionary liquidity buffers on the basis of internal risk models. Our model produces endogenous fluctuations driven by the pricing behaviour of firms and the wage setting behaviour of unions. Fluctuations lead to loan defaults which are exacerbated as lenders reduce lending and charge higher interest rates, inducing a credit crunch. We also study how making the inter-banking network more connected affects the key outcomes of the economy and find that while the flow of funds from surplus banks to firms can be increased, the latter effect is soon dominated by increasing instability in the real sector as firms default at higher rates. While the banking sector experiences fewer defaults as a whole, losses on the interbank market increase as a source of bank defaults. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It notes while some commentators suggest advanced economies are characterized by managerial job insecurity, others argue the same economies possess stable managerial tenure rates. To make sense of this conundrum, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with managers working in large corporations in liberal-market (USA, UK) and coordinated-market (Japan) societies are analysed. The aim is to assess whether sensitivity to managerial job insecurity is widespread and if so reflects wider corporate strategies of contrived competition' and manufactured uncertainty'. It is argued such notions can influence managers' understanding of their work situation through (re)producing narratives of employment precarity. Contrary to the message from many database and questionnaire studies, evidence from this international and longitudinal study suggests awareness of job insecurity is indeed widespread and does affect managers' views of their employment situation and prospects.","[Hassard, John] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business School, Org Anal, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Morris, Jonathan] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Manchester; Cardiff University,"Hassard, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",john.hassard@manchester.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (UK); university of Cardiff; university of Manchester,Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); university of Cardiff; university of Manchester,The first phase of research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (UK).

Previous experimental studies have shown that these higher-order risk preferences affect the choices of individuals deciding privately on lotteries that only affect their own payoff. Yet, many risky and financially relevant decisions are made in the social settings of households or organizations. We elicit higher-order risk preferences of individuals and systematically vary how an individual's decision is made (alone or while communicating with a partner) and who is affected by the decision (only the individual or the partner as well). In doing so, we can isolate the effects of other-regarding concerns and communication on choices. Our results reveal that the majority of choices are risk averse, prudent, and temperate across social settings. We also observe that individuals are influenced significantly by the preferences of a partner when they are able to communicate and choices are payoff-relevant for both of them.","[Heinrich, Timo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Stralsund Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business Studies, Stralsund, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Durham University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",timo.heinrich@ibes.uni-due.de,,"Mayrhofer, Thomas/0000-0001-6287-5185; Heinrich, Timo/0000-0001-6827-1374",German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 655]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies [01UC1304],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies,"We thank the co-editor Charles N.

Farmers perspectives on marginal land and its implications for adoption of dedicated energy crops,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Farming; Attitudes; Marginal land; Energy crops; Bioenergy,SHORT-ROTATION COPPICE; BIOMASS; BIOENERGY; SCHEMES; POLICY,"Dedicated energy crops such as miscanthus and short rotation coppice willow were expected by UK policy and academic modelling to be deployed across large swaths of UK marginal lands in response to farm and market level incentives, delivering on bioenergy policy objectives. Yet, this never materialised. This article examines a previously unanalysed component of this policy failure by comparing and contrasting policy and farmer perspectives on marginal land as a suitable site for energy crops. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 32 livestock, arable and mixed farmers in England this research suggests that the policy framing of energy crops on marginal land to resolve sustainability controversies, was translated by the farming community into 'energy crops are for marginal land'. This acted as a multifaceted barrier to dedicated energy crops due to complex interactions between farmers' personal and cultural values, on farm practices, technologies, regulations and market developments. Farmers, never considered their land marginal enough, consequently this policy framing invoked considerable resistance. This highlights the importance of embedding understandings of farmers' cultural values, on-farm practices, technological change, and tensions between different bodies of regulation when articulating new policy initiatives and the way in which policy narratives translate into practical settings.","[Helliwell, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Inst Sci & Soc, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Helliwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Inst Sci & Soc, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",lqzrh@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Helliwell, Richard/0000-0002-3765-7482",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the University of Nottingham Doctoral Training College (DTC) [1095542],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the University of Nottingham Doctoral Training College (DTC),"The author would like to thank Dr. Sujatha Raman, Dr, Susanne Seymour, Dr. Paul Wilson, and Dr. Alison Mohr for their constructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.

This paper focuses specifically on the financial barriers facing actors within the ICS value chain, such as manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. Examining data from interviews with twenty-nine ICS enterprises in Kenya and Uganda, this paper finds that limited access to credit services is a substantial barrier to increasing the capacity of businesses within the ICS value chain. In addition, data from twenty-seven financial providers including banks, micro finance institutions and savings and credit co-operatives (SACCOs) viewed the ICS market as relatively under served and believed greater integration could be mutually beneficial. This paper explores the way in which this relationship plays out in current market conditions and how connections between the two sectors can be strengthened, with the objective of overcoming these financial challenges and expanding the capacity of ICS businesses as a mechanism to facilitate ICS uptake by local populations.","[Hewitt, Joseph; Jewitt, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Ray, Charlotte; Clifford, Mike] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Hewitt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Igxjh3@nottingham.ac.uk; ezacr5@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk; sarah.jewitt@nottingham.ac.uk; mike.clifford@nottingham.ac.uk,"Clifford, Mike/AAC-7945-2019; Ray, Charlotte/M-7066-2019","Clifford, Mike/0000-0001-6379-2672; Jewitt, Sarah/0000-0002-7159-0621; ray, charlotte/0000-0001-7051-4275",Department for International Development [EP/L002639/1]; Department of Energy and Climate Change [EP/L002639/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L002639/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L002639/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L002639/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Department for International Development; Department of Energy and Climate Change; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was made possible by the Department for International Development, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's joint grant EP/L002639/1.",,66,10,12,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117,,,,,,127,135,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.044,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000431932600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Labels with broad scope (like sustainability) coexist with niche competitors much narrower in scope (like bird-friendliness). When NGOs compete for adoptions, the wrong suite of schemes emerges, providing a rationale for regulation. An incumbent NGO may strategically narrow the breadth of its label to deter entry of competing schemes, reducing welfare. Even when entry is accommodated, welfare is compromised. Modeling multi-issue competition between NGOs allows us to be the first to analyze label fragmentation and provide a novel perspective on proliferation that has frustrated practitioners.","[Heyes, Anthony; Martin, Steve] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Heyes, Anthony] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Ottawa; University of Sussex,"Heyes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Heyes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",aheyes@uottawa.ca; smart041@uottawa.ca,,"Heyes, Anthony/0000-0003-1847-9374; Martin, Steve/0000-0003-2544-9480",CRC; SSHRC [435-2012-472]; SSHRC through its Canadian Graduate Scholarship program,"CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); SSHRC through its Canadian Graduate Scholarship program(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","Heyes gratefully acknowledges financial support from CRC and SSHRC under Insight Grant 435-2012-472.

Social enterprises sit within the third sector of the economy, typically where market or governmental failures exist in the provision of social welfare, and have increasingly become a key driver of social progress. The autonomous nature of the social-economic model applied by such organisations can represent a viable means to reduce state social welfare dependence, and is a proven model for social change. The capability of social enterprises to create both social and economic value is considered a 'win-win'. Yet there are clear potentials for social enterprise models to be more extensively applied to address contemporary ecological challenges of neo-liberal market economies, moving towards 'win-win-win' outcomes across social, economic and ecological domains. This paper investigates the value of social enterprises as drivers of low-carbon transition at the community level, with an emphasis on the energy sector. Evidence from seven organisations in the UK is presented and a socio-technical transitions conceptual framework is applied to analyse these social enterprise operations as a form of social innovation.","[Hillman, Joanne; Axon, Stephen; Morrissey, John] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Axon, Stephen] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Morrissey, John] Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland",Liverpool John Moores University; Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; University of Limerick,"Morrissey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland.",J.s.Hillman@2012.ljmu.ac.uk; S.J.Axon@ljmu.ac.uk; john.morrissey@mic.ul.ie,,"Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118",European Union [657998]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [657998] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This paper has been developed from research conducted as part of the ENTRUST project, funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 657998.

Although substitution policies seen with generic drugs are being considered as a means to reduce expenditures on biologics, some biosimilars pose particular challenges in that the act of substitution may eventually lead to increased rates of therapeutic failure. As evidence requirements from regulators do not directly address this challenge, switch trials of biosimilars have emerged that may provide further answers. Using infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease as an example, we critically examine emerging evidence from two key switch trials (NOR-SWITCH and NCT020968610) and discuss the clinical and economic implications of these and what policy options may be most reasonable for payers. Options include reimbursing biosimilars for only newly diagnosed patients, using product-listing agreements to manage uncertainty, or using tiered co-payments or other incentives to promote biosimilar use.","[Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Room 101,600 Peter Morand Crescent, Ottawa, ON K1G 5Z3, Canada; [Feagan, Brian] Univ Western Ontario, Robarts Res, Robarts Clin Trials, London, ON, Canada; [Feagan, Brian] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Med, London, ON, Canada; [Feagan, Brian] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, ON, Canada; [Selya-Hammer, Carl] Amaris Consulting, London, England",University of Ottawa; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Husereau, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Room 101,600 Peter Morand Crescent, Ottawa, ON K1G 5Z3, Canada.",donh@donhusereau.com,"Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Feagan, Brian/G-3292-2011","Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876;",Janssen/JJ,Janssen/JJ(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),All authors have received funding from Janssen/J&J for market access advice and analysis.

No two universities offer identical teaching. There is large variation in contact hours and even larger variation in teaching intensity, across both universities and departments. We combine our data with existing data to investigate the relationship that teaching has with university and student characteristics.

We evaluate five Brexit scenarios, based on different assumptions regarding Brexit, TTIP and various free trade deals the UK may attempt to broker with the US or Commonwealth countries. We also consider the dynamics of welfare changes over a period of two decades. Our estimates suggest that the impact of Brexit is negative in all policy scenarios, with lower welfare losses under a soft Brexit scenario. The losses are exacerbated if TTIP comes into force, demonstrating the benefits of being a member of a large trade bloc. However, they occur gradually and can be partially compensated by signing new free trade agreements. To further minimise losses, the UK should avoid a hard Brexit.","[Jackson, Karen] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England; [Shepotylo, Oleksandr] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Emm Lane, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England",University of Westminster; University of Bradford,"Jackson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",K.Jackson@westminster.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023; Shepotylo, Oleksandr/G-4773-2015","Shepotylo, Oleksandr/0000-0003-4990-6025",,,,,54,15,15,2,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Jumps, in particular exponential Levy and affine models, which exhibit small-maturity exploding smiles, have historically been proposed to remedy this (see Tankov in Pricing and hedging in exponential Levy models: review of recent results. Paris-Princeton Lecture Notes in Mathematical Finance, Springer, Berlin, 2010 for an overview), and more recently rough volatility models (Alos et al. in On the short-time behavior of the implied volatility for jump-diffusion models with stochastic volatility.

We suggest here a different route, randomising the Black-Scholes variance by a CEV-generated distribution, which allows us to modulate the rate of explosion (through the CEV exponent) of the implied volatility for small maturities.

The analysis demonstrates the importance of pragmatic alliances of progressive local politicians, unions and employers in ensuring that socially responsible procurement moves beyond rhetoric, along with supportive national and sectoral employment regimes.

The corresponding steady states result in suboptimal investments, due to selection bias and the heterogeneity of signals across investors. When higher signals are associated with higher returns, investors are overoptimistic, resulting in overinvestment.

Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model's niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.","[Jenkins, Kirsten] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [McCauley, Darren] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of Sussex; University of Sussex; Aarhus University; University of St Andrews,"Jenkins, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Jubilee Bldg,Room 348, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",k.e.jenkins@sussex.ac.uk; b.sovacool@sussex.ac.uk; dam7@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019; McCauley, Darren/GYJ-6924-2022","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; McCauley, Darren/0000-0002-3951-1129; Jenkins, Kirsten/0000-0002-3681-647X","Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) [EP/K011790/1]; ESRC [ES/1001425/1]; EPSRC [EP/I035390/1]; ESRC; EPSRC; EPSRC [EP/I035390/1, EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/I001425/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I001425/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1, EP/I035390/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand, which has supported elements of the work reported here, as well as research grants from the ESRC (ES/1001425/1) and EPSRC (EP/I035390/1).

Our simulations indicate that in 2011, had the share of trade by the sourcing economy remained at the level of 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008 whereas the global final demand remained the same, global CO2 emissions in production processes would have been 2.8 Gt, 2.0 Gt, 13 Gt, and 540 Mt., respectively, lower than the actual emissions. As there is a general outsourcing trend shifted from developed economies to developing economies, the overall direct emission costs have always been significantly positive. Further investigations by economy and industry show that such a geographic shift was mainly dominated by developed economies themselves and occurred in high-tech industries, such as production of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) goods and machinery, leading to positive emission cost in developing economies, especially China. Moreover, there is potentially even larger influence of geographic shift of sourcing on global CO2 emissions, as such a shift would stimulate the economic growth and consumptions in developing economies, consequently this may bring additional energy demand and CO2 emissions. Our results addressed the urgency of eliminating in carbon emission intensity gap between developing and developed economies and the successful development of new, scalable low carbon energy sourcing and technologies across the world.

Speakers and panelists explored the utility of information derived from existing and emerging PRO measures, focusing on the PRO version of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Panelists and speakers discussed potential ways to improve the collection, analysis, and presentation of PRO data describing symptomatic adverse events to support drug development and better inform regulatory and treatment decisions. Workshop participants concluded the day with a discussion of possible approaches to the patient-reported assessment of an investigational drug's overall side effect burden as a potential clinical trial end point.

Results for a sample of 14 Asian countries reveal a large and positive long-run impact of human capital on growth in the 1960-2013 period. Looking at different types of education we find that the diffusion of primary and secondary education has a positive long-run impact, while the long-run effect of tertiary education is negative. Low proportion of people educated at the tertiary level, lack of opportunities for highly educated workers and the brain drain phenomenon could explain this result.

Recently, there have been a number of developments in methods and guidelines addressing missing data in trials. However, it is unclear whether these developments have permeated CEA practice. This paper critically reviews the extent of and methods used to address missing data in recently published trial-based CEA. Issues of the Health Technology Assessment journal from 2013 to 2015 were searched. Fifty-two eligible studies were identified. Missing data were very common; the median proportion of trial participants with complete cost-effectiveness data was 63% (interquartile range: 47%-81%). The most common approach for the primary analysis was to restrict analysis to those with complete data (43%), followed by multiple imputation (30%). Half of the studies conducted some sort of sensitivity analyses, but only 2 (4%) considered possible departures from the missing-at-random assumption. Further improvements are needed to address missing data in cost-effectiveness analyses conducted alongside randomised trials. These should focus on limiting the extent of missing data, choosing an appropriate method for the primary analysis that is valid under contextually plausible assumptions, and conducting sensitivity analyses to departures from the missing-at-random assumption.","[Leurent, Baptiste; Carpenter, James R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Gomes, Manuel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Carpenter, James R.] UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; University College London; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit,"Leurent, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",baptiste.leurent@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Carpenter, James/0000-0003-3890-6206; Leurent, Baptiste/0000-0001-6420-6567; Gomes, Manuel/0000-0002-1428-1232",Research Trainees Coordinating Centre [DRF-12437]; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12023/21]; MRC [MC_UU_12023/21] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Trainees Coordinating Centre; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Research Trainees Coordinating Centre, Grant/Award Number: DRF-12437; Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: MC_UU_12023/21.",,30,35,37,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUN,2018,27,6,,,,,1024,1040,,10.1002/hec.3654,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3654,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF0UN,29573044,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000431646700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on CPS data from 1980 to 2015, we find that increasing the minimum wage decreases significantly the share of automatable employment held by low-skilled workers, and increases the likelihood that low-skilled workers in automatable jobs become nonemployed or employed in worse jobs. The average effects mask significant heterogeneity by industry and demographic group, including substantive adverse effects for older, low-skilled workers in manufacturing. We also find some evidence that the same changes improve job opportunities for higher-skilled workers. The findings imply that groups often ignored in the minimum wage literature are in fact quite vulnerable to employment changes and job loss because of automation following a minimum wage increase.","[Lordan, Grace] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Neumark, David] UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dneumark@uci.edu,,,,,,,42,56,59,5,79,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2018,52,,,,,,40,53,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.03.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2018.03.006,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL1ZV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000436913700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

By the mid-1950s, they had not only become what later were called monetarists, but the findings from their joint work defined monetarism. The key factor underlying the change in their views was what they learned from their study of U.S. historical experience, especially their empirical confirmation of the Fed's role in the Great Depression. Here, the influence of Clark Warburton on Friedman's thinking loomed large.

Such waters, and their associated ecosystem services, offer multiple benefits. Valuation and bargaining can play a key role in the sharing of these ecosystems services and their associated benefits across sovereign borders. Ecosystem services in transboundary watercourses essentially constitute a portfolio of assets. While challenging, their commodification, which creates property rights, supports trading. Such trading offers a means by which to resolve conflicts over competing uses and allows states to optimise their 'portfolios'. However, despite this potential, adoption of appropriate treaty frameworks that might facilitate a market-based approach to the discovery and allocation of water-related ecosystem services at the transboundary level remains both a challenge and a topic worthy of further study. Drawing upon concepts in law and economics, this paper therefore seeks to advance the study of how treaty frameworks might be developed in a way that supports such a market-based approach to ecosystem services and transboundary waters.","[Macatangay, Rafael Emmanuel] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Rieu-Clarke, Alistair] Northumbria Univ, Law Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Dundee; Northumbria University,"Rieu-Clarke, A (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Law Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",r.e.a.macatangay@dundee.ac.uk; Alistair.rieu-clarke@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Macatangay, Rafael Emmanuel/0000-0001-8604-9347; Rieu-Clarke, Alistair/0000-0003-1492-133X",,,,,100,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This improves the fit to the data as shown by a higher log marginal likelihood and closer match to key business cycle statistics. The labour frictions introduced are relevant for model dynamics and economic policy: the effect of total factor productivity shocks on most macroeconomic variables is substantially mitigated; fiscal policy leads to a greater crowding out of private sector activity and monetary policy has a lower impact on output. Labour frictions also provide a better match to impulse response functions from vector autoregressive models.","[Madeira, Joao] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Madeira, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",joao.madeira@york.ac.uk,"Madeira, João/AEE-8058-2022","Madeira, João/0000-0002-7380-9009",,,,,47,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

At the theoretical level it has been argued that FDI is growth enhancing. However, existing empirical studies have left researchers and policy makers perplexed as these studies do not appear to find a strong relationship between the two variables. This paper departs from the existing literature by exploring the transmission channels from FDI to growth. The results, based on a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1970-2007, conclusively reveal that FDI affects growth via inputs accumulation but not the total factor productivity growth channel. In other words, our results suggest that factors other than FDI may have contributed to the increase in productivity witnessed in developing countries in recent decades.","[Makiela, Kamil] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, 1st Floor Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Cracow University of Economics; University of Manchester,"Ouattara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, 1st Floor Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",osman.ouattara-2@manchester.ac.uk,"Makieła, Kamil/T-5786-2018","Makieła, Kamil/0000-0003-1236-2423",,,,,57,57,60,0,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We investigated the effects of SME's use of BSC in terms of financial performance and innovation outcomes. Our arguments are based on the efficiency gains and potential flexibility losses associated with formalizing managerial practices in SMEs. We propose that the developmental stage of the firm may influence this trade-off. Based on a survey of 201 SMEs in Spain, we found that firms using BSC for feedforward control obtained better financial performance and presented higher levels of exploitative innovation.

Taking this estimation net of the usual gravity controls we propose an alternative happiness index that is consistent with the revealed preferences about happiness determinants in countries with different development levels and institutions. The revelation of preferences is indicated by the estimated coefficients for each of the determinants of happiness such that their weights in the proposed migration-based index directly result from observed data. Finally, we compare the country classification suggested by our proposed index and two existing indexes based on self-assessed happiness, and analyse the sources of existing mismatches, with policy implications.","[Marques, Helena] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Edificio Jovellanos,Cta De Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Pino, Gabriel] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, 2 Norte 685, Talca, Chile; [Tena, J.

F.",,,Long-Term Costs and Health Consequences of Issuing Shorter Duration Prescriptions for Patients with Chronic Health Conditions in the English NHS,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DEPRESSION; MEDICINES,"Background The National Health Service (NHS) in England spends over 9 pound billion on prescription medicines dispensed in primary care, of which over two-thirds is accounted for by repeat prescriptions. Recently, GPs in England have been urged to limit the duration of repeat prescriptions, where clinically appropriate, to 28 days to reduce wastage and hence contain costs. However, shorter prescriptions will increase transaction costs and thus may not be cost saving. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that shorter prescriptions are associated with lower adherence, which would be expected to lead to lower clinical benefit. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 3-month versus 28-day repeat prescriptions from the perspective of the NHS. Methods We adapted three previously developed UK policy-relevant models, incorporating transaction (dispensing fees, prescriber time) and drug wastage costs associated with 3-month and 28-day prescriptions in three case studies: antihypertensive medications for prevention of cardiovascular events; drugs to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; and treatments for depression. Results In all cases, 3-month prescriptions were associated with lower costs and higher QALYs than 28-day prescriptions. This is driven by assumptions that higher adherence leads to improved disease control, lower costs and improved QALYs. Conclusions Longer repeat prescriptions may be cost-effective compared with shorter ones. However, the quality of the evidence base on which this modelling is based is poor. Any policy rollout should be within the context of a trial such as a stepped-wedge cluster design.","[Martin, Adam] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Martin, Adam] RAND Europe, Cambridge Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Cambridge CB4 1YG, England; [Payne, Rupert] Univ Bristol, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Payne, Rupert; Wilson, Edward C.

Unlike most of the existing literature, we draw on matched data and focus at the firm, occupation and worker levels, which enables us to link the labour market outcomes of natives and immigrants precisely at the locus where many popular beliefs are formed. This paper, therefore, provides a novel test of complementarity and substitutability between the natives and immigrants. Our main result shows that, contrary to previous evidence, natives at even the lower end of the skills spectrum have their employment positively affected by the presence of immigrants in the same firm and occupation. The results highlight the importance of suitable data to properly assess the impact of migration on host country's labour market.","[Martins, Pedro S.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Martins, Pedro S.] NovaSBE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Pedro S.; Piracha, Matloob; Varejao, Jose] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Piracha, Matloob] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Varejao, Jose] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Roberto Friers S-N, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal; [Varejao, Jose] CEF UP, Porto, Portugal",University of London; Queen Mary University London; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Kent; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Martins, PS (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.;Martins, PS (通讯作者)，NovaSBE, Lisbon, Portugal.;Martins, PS (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",p.martins@qmul.ac.uk,"Varejao, Jose/B-6959-2009; Martins, Pedro S./B-6059-2009; Martins, Pedro/GWC-7702-2022","Martins, Pedro S./0000-0001-9323-5252; Piracha, Matloob/0000-0003-0885-349X; Varejao, Jose/0000-0002-7053-8784",FCT [PTDC/EGE-ECO/120020/2010]; FCTs 'Programa Compete'; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/120020/2010] Funding Source: FCT,FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCTs 'Programa Compete'; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We would like to thank Gianluca Orefice, two anonymous referees, the Editor, Sushanta Mallick, as well as conference participants at the International workshop on Economics of Global Interactions, University of Bari, for comments on an earlier version.

This paper is concerned with inference (i.e. confidence intervals and hypothesis testing) in semiparametric models. In contrast to the conventional approach based on t-ratios, we advocate likelihood-based inference. In particular, we study two widely applied semiparametric problems, weighted average derivatives and treatment effects, and propose semiparametric empirical likelihood and jackknife empirical likelihood methods. We derive the limiting behaviour of these empirical likelihood statistics and investigate their finite sample performance through Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we extend the (delete-1) jackknife empirical likelihood toward the delete-d version with growing d and establish general asymptotic theory. This extension is crucial to deal with non-smooth objects, such as quantiles and quantile average derivatives or treatment effects, due to the well-known inconsistency phenomena of the jackknife under non-smoothness.","[Matsushita, Yukitoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Otsu, Taisuke] London Sch Econ, London, England",Hitotsubashi University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Matsushita, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,ERC [SNP 615882]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780133] Funding Source: KAKEN,"ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors would like to thank an anonymous referee and participants at the 2017 Japanese Economic Association Spring Meeting for helpful comments.

Focus on the labour process shows how self-employment' is used to remove so-called unproductive' time from the remit of paid labour. Using Smith's concept of double indeterminacy the article captures the dynamic relationship between those on standard and non-standard contracts and interdependency of effort power and mobility power. It exposes the apparent mobility and autonomy of dependent self-employed drivers while suggesting that their presence, alongside the increased use of technology, reconfigures the work-effort bargain across contractual status.","[Moore, Sian] Univ Greenwich, Employment Relat & Human Resource Management, London, England; [Moore, Sian] Univ Greenwich, Work & Employment Res Unit, London, England; [Newsome, Kirsty] Univ Sheffield, Management School, Employment Relat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Greenwich; University of Greenwich; University of Sheffield,"Moore, S (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Business Sch, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",S.Moore@Greenwich.ac.uk,,,small British Academy/Leverhulme grant,small British Academy/Leverhulme grant,The research is part of wider research funded by a small British Academy/Leverhulme grant.,,42,48,52,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In England, a new prospective provider payment system is being introduced to mental health that should encourage providers to control costs and improve outcomes. The aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between costs and outcomes to ascertain whether there is a trade-off between controlling costs and improving outcomes. The main data source is the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS) for the years 2011/12 and 2012/13. Costs are calculated using NHS reference cost data while outcomes are measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). We estimate a bivariate multi-level model with costs and outcomes simultaneously. We calculate the correlation and plot the pairwise relationship between residual costs and outcomes at the provider level. After controlling for a range of demographic, need, social, and treatment variables, residual variation in costs and outcomes remains at the provider level. The correlation between residual costs and outcomes is negative, but very small, suggesting that cost-containment efforts by providers should not undermine outcome-improving efforts under the new payment system.","[Moran, Valerie] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Jacobs, Rowena] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of York - UK,"Moran, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",valerie.moran@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Jacobs, Rowena/0000-0001-5225-6321",Centre for Health Economics (University of York),Centre for Health Economics (University of York),"This work is funded by a Centre for Health Economics (University of York) PhD Studentship held by Valerie Moran.

We exploit the identification in international trade data of parent markets (countries) to investigate whether exporting employee spinoffs of exporting parents have an advantage in accessing their parents' markets over exporting comparison firms well positioned to learn those markets at arm's length. We find that, controlling for the greater overlap of spinoffs with their parents' export products, at entry spinoffs access 51 percent more parent markets than exporting firms in the same 4-digit industries and municipalities as the parents. This advantage shrinks monotonically with time, becoming statistically insignificant four years after entry, indicating that intrafirm learning provides spinoffs with a four-year head start over learning at arm's length. Spinoffs do not overlap more than comparison firms with parent markets that the parents did not serve at spinoff entry, providing evidence against the alternative hypothesis that product overlap inadequately controls for greater technological similarity of spinoffs to parents. Firm entry into parent markets predicted by spinoff status does not lead to entry into adjacent markets the following year. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The value sets' characteristics differ, and it is important to assess the implications of these differences. The aim of this paper is to compare the three value sets. We carried out analysis comparing the predicted values from each value set, and investigated how differences in health on the descriptive system is reflected in the utility score by assessing the value of adjacent states. We also assessed differences in values using data from patients who completed both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L. The distribution of the value sets systematically differed. EQ-5D-5L values were higher than EQ-5D-3L/crosswalk values. The overall range and difference between adjacent states was smaller. In the patient data, the EQ-5D-5L produced higher values across all conditions and there was some evidence that the value sets rank different health conditions in a similar severity order. There are important differences between the value sets. Due to the smaller range of EQ-5D-5L values, the possible change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) might be reduced, but they will apply to both control and intervention groups, and will depend on whether the gain is in quality of life, survival, or both. The increased sensitivity of EQ-5D-5L may also favour QALY gains even if the changes in utility are smaller. Further work should assess the impact of the different value sets on cost effectiveness by repeating the analysis on clinical trial data.","[Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Feng, Yan; Shah, Koonal; Herdman, Michael; Devlin, Nancy] Southside, Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Janssen, Mathieu F.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Technology Sydney; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; University of Sheffield,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",Brendan.mulhern@chere.uts.edu.au,"Herdman, Michael/AAI-7280-2020; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",,,,,34,67,71,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2018,36,6,,,,,699,713,,10.1007/s40273-018-0628-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0628-3,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GG0LA,29476363,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432368700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010-2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.","[Narlochand, Ulf; Bangalore, Mook] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work is part of programmatic work on Climate Change, Poverty and Climate Resilience in Vietnam and was developed under the oversight of Christophe Crepin and Stephane Hallegatte.

We compare the performance of a Nested Bisection Search (NBS) and a novel Scatter Search (SS) metaheuristic using 1280 instances from literature and we derive managerial implications from a real-life case.

This study is significant given the inherent difficulties in modelling the substantial renewals element of infrastructure costs, as well as the need to account for the dynamics in renewals and maintenance. The dynamic model allows us to estimate equilibrium cost elasticities with respect to train usage, which are significantly larger than their static counterparts. Overall, this work highlights that dynamics in rail infrastructure costs are important to consider when setting track access charges with respect to the wear and tear caused by traffic. This is particularly important given several countries, for example France, Sweden and Switzerland, are now setting access charges at marginal costs based on econometric studies.","[Odolinski, Kristofer] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wheat, Phill] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",VTI; University of Leeds,"Odolinski, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",kristofer.odolinski@vti.se; p.e.wheat@its.leeds.ac.uk,,,Swedish Transport Administration; European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA [636237]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M023109/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M023109/1] Funding Source: researchfish; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [636237] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme; EPSRC [EP/M023109/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Swedish Transport Administration; European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are grateful to the Swedish Transport Administration, European Commission Horizon2020 project NeTIRail-INFRA (Grant number 636237) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant number EP/M023109/1) for funding this research.

Methods: Participating modeling groups were asked to reproduce the results of two published studies using the input data described in those articles. Gaps in input data were filled with assumptions reported by the modeling groups. Goodness of fit between the results reported in the target studies and the groups' replicated outputs was evaluated using the slope of linear regression line and the coefficient of determination (R-2). After a general discussion of the results, a diabetes-specific checklist for the transparency of model input was developed. Results: Seven groups participated in the transparency challenge. The reporting of key model input parameters in the two studies, including the baseline characteristics of simulated patients, treatment effect and treatment intensification threshold assumptions, treatment effect evolution, prediction of complications and costs data, was inadequately transparent (and often missing altogether). Not surprisingly, goodness of fit was better for the study that reported its input data with more transparency. To improve the transparency in diabetes modeling, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist listing the minimal input data required for reproducibility in most diabetes modeling applications was developed. Conclusions: Transparency of diabetes model inputs is important to the reproducibility and credibility of simulation results. In the Eighth Mount Hood Challenge, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist was developed with the goal of improving the transparency of input data reporting and reproducibility of diabetes simulation model results.","[Palmer, Andrew J.; Si, Lei] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Med Sci 1 Bldg,17 Liverpool St Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Tew, Michelle; Hua, Xinyang; Tran-Duy, An; Clarke, Philip M.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Willis, Michael S.; Asseburg, Christian] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Leal, Jose; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Foos, Volker; Lamotte, Mark] Real World Evidence Solut, IQVIA, Zaventem, Belgium; [Feenstra, Talitha] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Feenstra, Talitha] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Ctr Chron Care Innovat, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Brandle, Michael] Kantonsspital St Gallen, Dept Internal Med, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Smolen, Harry J.; Gahn, James C.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Valentine, William J.; Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland; [Si, Lei; Tew, Michelle; Breeze, Penny; Brennan, Alan; Pollard, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ye, Wen; Isaman, Deanna J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.; Kuo, Shihchen] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Laiteerapong, Neda] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Melbourne; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; University of Oxford; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; University of Groningen; Kantonsspital St. Gallen; Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

In this paper, we assess the current distribution of heat exposure within countries, to explore possible distributional consequences of climate change through temperature. Combining survey data from 690,745 households across 52 countries with spatial data on climate, this paper suggests that the welfare impacts of added heat stress may be regressive within countries. We find: (1) a strong negative correlation between household wealth and warmer temperature in many hot countries; (2) a strong positive correlation between household wealth and warmer temperatures in many cold countries; and (3) that poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure. While our analysis is descriptive rather than causal, our results suggest a larger vulnerability of poor people to heat extremes, and potentially significant distributional and poverty implications of climate change.","[Park, Jisung] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook; Hallegatte, Stephane] World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sandhoefner, Evan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; The World Bank; Harvard University,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank Geoffrey Heal, Marianne Fay, Laura Bonzanigo, Tom Pullum, Ruilin Ren and Clara Burgert, as well as participants at the World Bank Poverty and Climate Change conference, for valuable comments and feedback.

Hashem; Smith, Ron P.",,,Tests of Policy Interventions in DSGE Models,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY,"This paper considers tests of the effectiveness of a policy intervention, defined as a change in the parameters of a policy rule, in the context of a macroeconometric dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We consider two types of intervention, first the standard case of a parameter change that does not alter the steady state, and second one that does alter the steady state, e.g. the target rate of inflation. We consider two types of test, one a multi-horizon test, where the postintervention policy horizon, H, is small and fixed, and a mean policy effect test where H is allowed to increase without bounds. The multi-horizon test requires Gaussian errors, but the mean policy effect test does not. It is shown that neither of these two tests are consistent, in the sense that the power of the tests does not tend to unity as H, unless the intervention alters the steady state. This follows directly from the fact that DSGE variables are measured as deviations from the steady state, and the effects of policy change on target variables decay exponentially fast. We investigate the size and power of the proposed mean effect test by simulating a standard three equation New Keynesian DSGE model. The simulation results are in line with our theoretical findings and show that in all applications the tests have the correct size; but unless the intervention alters the steady state, their power does not go to unity with H.","[Pesaran, M.

The findings of this paper suggest that countries with better institutions and high information flows receive high capital flows, and information flows also provides a partial explanation to the Lucas Paradox. The latter result is significant even after controlling for institutional quality, financial openness and human capital differences across countries, and using instrumental variable for information flows. This paper also examines the indirect effects of institutional quality on capital flows per capita through its impact on information flows and finds that countries with better institutional quality have higher levels of information flow. Accounting this indirect effect is economically important and papers that do not account for this indirect effect of institutions on capital flows per capita would underestimate the effect of institutions on capital flows per capita. Findings of this paper suggest that relatively poorer countries should improve their institutional quality and increase their access to worldwide information and promote investments in communications infrastructure to attract long-term capital flows.

They are seen to provide a much lower cost option of mass mobility than fixed rail or underground systems which developing countries struggle to afford. Whilst BRT systems have undoubtedly been seen to be successful from a transport system perspective, they are more than a transport system innovation. They are often introduced to replace what is seen to be a failing, unsafe and poorly regulated informal transit system. This paper therefore focuses on the process of BRT introduction as a governance reform. The paper draws on African experience where adoption of BRT has been slow relative to South America and South East Asia. Using an in-depth analysis of the introduction of a new system in Ghana and data on levels of governance maturity across the African sub-continent, the paper finds that to understand BRT implementation requires an understanding of how the incumbent transport regime could and will be able to be reorganized. The success of BRT systems that result will depend at least as much on how the reforms are achieved as it will on the usual design concerns which typically occupy transport planners.","[Poku-Boansi, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Fac Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; [Marsden, Greg] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Poku-Boansi, M (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Fac Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana.",mpoku-boansi.cap@knust.edu.gh; G.R.Marsden@its.leeds.ac.uk,"Poku-Boansi, Michael/AGZ-8640-2022","Poku-Boansi, Michael/0000-0003-4929-0961; Marsden, Greg/0000-0003-3570-2793",Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat [GHCF-2016-13],Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Commonwealth Scholarship Secretariat for the support granted the corresponding author during his Academic Fellowship (GHCF-2016-13) at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds.

While conjectures that publications in lower-rated journals likely have a negative impact on such judgments are common, there have been virtually no direct tests of their validity. Our intent is to provide results from such a test, one that involved asking economists from 44 universities throughout the world to rate either a publication list with only higher-rated journals or a list with all of these but with additional publications in lower-rated journals. Our primary finding was that, holding other things constant, adding publications in lower-rated journals to what is typically considered a good publication record does have a significant negative impact on economists' judgments of the value of the author's contribution.

We expect strong trade unions and left-leaning governments to be associated with more, and more far-reaching labor provisions in PTAs. We also expect the strength of skilled workers relative to the strength of unskilled workers to negatively correlate with the depth of labor provisions in PTAs. In addition, the effect of trade unions should be conditional on both the presence of left government and democracy. We test these hypotheses relying on an original dataset of labor provisions included in 483 PTAs signed between 1990 and 2016. This dataset covers 140 different labor provisions that relate to six overarching dimensions. The quantitative analysis finds support for the expectations concerning the influence of trade unions and the role of a country's skill profile.","[Raess, Damian] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Raess, Damian] Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Dur, Andreas] Univ Salzburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Sari, Dora] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Blvd Pont Arve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sari, Dora] Harvard Law Sch, Labor & Worklife Program, 8 Mt Auburn St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Bern; University of Reading; Salzburg University; University of Geneva; Harvard University,"Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",damian.raess@wti.org; andreas.duer@sbg.ac.at; dora.sari@etu.unige.ch,"Dür, Andreas/HTN-9240-2023","Dür, Andreas/0000-0001-6621-7243; Sari, Dora/0000-0002-0216-7088",Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,"This paper is part of the Swiss Network for International Studies funded project A Social Clause through the Back Door: Labor Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements (Call for projects 2014; project coordinator: Dr. Damian Raess).

Despite theoretical arguments for the influence of emotions, research on susceptibility to this bias, on real investors, has relied primarily on socio-demographic explanations. Some experimental research on student populations has considered emotions more directly, but has not addressed differences in individual susceptibility and has not examined genuinely consequential investor behaviour in real markets. Our research addresses this gap by predicting susceptibility to the disposition effect based on investors' reliance on intuitive (emotion mediated) cognition (System 1), analytical cognition (System 2) and the strategies they use to regulate their emotions. Using investors' trading records from a UK sample, we measure their susceptibility to the disposition effect and assess, through a questionnaire, their reliance on Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processes and use of two emotion regulation strategies. Investors with higher reliance on System 1 processes have greater disposition effect, but reliance on System 2 processes is not related to the disposition effect. Investor reliance on reappraisal (an emotion regulation strategy of changing a situation's meaning to alter its emotional impact) reduces their disposition effect. However, the use of expressive suppression (a strategy that inhibits emotion expressive behaviour) does not show a statistically significant relationship with this bias. These results suggest that investors' intuitive emotional reactions explain susceptibility to bias, and that effective strategies of regulating emotions enable this bias to be overcome.

This article explores the contradictions and tensions that arise from different processes of normalisation driven by social policies that simultaneously decommodify and recommodify labour. An expanded framework of decommodification is presented that identifies how the standard employment relationship (SER) may be extended and flexibilised to include those in precarious work, drawing examples from a recent study of precarious work across six European countries. These decommodification processes are found to be both partial and, in some cases, coexisting with activation policies that position precarious work as an alternative to unemployment, thereby recommodifying labour. Despite these challenges and contradictions, the article argues that a new vision of SER reform promises greater inclusion than alternative policy scenarios that give up on the regulation of employers and rely on state subsidies to mitigate against precariousness.","[Rubery, Jill] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Comparat Employment Syst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Grimshaw, Damian] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Employment Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Grimshaw, Damian] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Geneva Off, Geneva, Switzerland; [Keizer, Arjan] Univ Manchester, Int HRM & Comparat Ind Relat, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Johnson, Mathew] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Work & Equal Inst, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Work & Equal Inst, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Jill.Rubery@manchester.ac.uk,,"Johnson, Mathew/0000-0003-1773-6391; Keizer, Arjan/0000-0002-0331-6081","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue [VP/2014/004]","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities VP/2014/004, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue.",,43,138,142,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

By focusing on the expected real interest rate, previous studies provide some empirical support for explanations of the Great Depression that are not exclusively monetary in nature. However, these studies did not consider the context and the market microstructures from which the data was sourced. Our analysis suggests that it is more likely that agricultural commodity markets adjusted to deflationary expectations by the end of 1930. Evidence from commodities futures markets, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, therefore should not be used to critique the Keynesian challenge to the classical monetarist explanation of the Great Depression.

The intensity measure is unknown and depends on covariates, possibly many more than the observed number of jumps. Only a single trajectory of the counting process is observed. Interest lies in estimating the intensity conditional on the covariates. The impact of the covariates is modelled by an additive model where each component can be written as a linear combination of possibly unknown functions. The focus is on prediction as opposed to variable screening. Conditions are imposed on the coefficients of this linear combination in order to control the estimation error. The rates of convergence are optimal when the number of active covariates is large. As an application, the intensity of the buy and sell trades of the New Zealand Dollar futures is estimated and a test for forecast evaluation is presented.

We estimate the effects of jet fuel price changes on European airfares at airline/route level by discriminating on the grounds of supplied capacity and markets' competitive structure. Our results show that airlines tend to adjust fares asymmetrically following a rocket and feather behaviour. The asymmetric pricing is marked in periods of decreasing capacity when the increases of fuel price are passed at a higher degree than fuel cost savings. In contrast, when capacity increases the asymmetry is lowered. Moreover, we show that highly competitive markets are characterized by a lower price asymmetry compared to low competition markets. Finally, our results show that airline price asymmetry reaches its maximum when capacity is reduced and competition is low.","[Scotti, Davide] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Via Pasubio 7, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Volta, Nicola] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England",University of Bergamo; Cranfield University,"Volta, N (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",davide.scotti@unibg.it; n.volta@cranfield.ac.ul,"Scotti, Davide/AGX-5924-2022","Scotti, Davide/0000-0001-9670-0199; Volta, Nicola/0000-0002-4436-4469",,,,,48,12,12,2,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

In these situations, additional information, often in the form of expert judgments, is needed to reach a decision. There are formal methods to quantify experts' beliefs, termed as structured expert elicitation (SEE), but only limited research is available in support of methodological choices. Perhaps as a consequence, the use of SEE in the context of cost-effectiveness modelling is limited. Objectives: This article reviews applications of SEE in cost-effectiveness modelling with the aim of summarizing the basis for methodological choices made in each application and recording the difficulties and challenges reported by the authors in the design, conduct, and analyses. Methods: The methods used in each application were extracted along with the criteria used to support methodological and practical choices and any issues or challenges discussed in the text. Issues and challenges were extracted using an open field, and then categorised and grouped for reporting. Results: The review demonstrates considerable heterogeneity in methods used, and authors acknowledge great methodological uncertainty in justifying their choices. Specificities of the context area emerging as potentially important in determining further methodological research in elicitation are between expert variation and its interpretation, the fact that substantive experts in the area may not be trained in quantitative subjects, that judgments are often needed on various parameter types, the need for some form of assessment of validity, and the need for more integration with behavioural research to devise relevant debiasing strategies. Conclusions: This review of experiences of SEE highlights a number of specificities/constraints that can shape the development of guidance and target future research efforts in this area.","[Soares, Marta O.; Claxton, Karl; Bojke, Laura] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Sharples, Linda] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Med Stat Dept, London, England; [Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Management Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Strathclyde; University of York - UK,"Soares, MO (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",marta.soares@york.ac.uk,"Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023","Soares, Marta Ferreira Oliveira/0000-0003-1579-8513; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517; Sharples, Linda/0000-0003-0894-966X",Medical Research Council [MR/N028511/1]; Health Economics and Outcome Measurement Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber [IS-CLA-0113-10020]; MRC [MR/N028511/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/N028511/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Health Economics and Outcome Measurement Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Work contributing to this article was conducted as part of a Medical Research Council grant HEE: Developing a reference protocol for expert elicitation in health care decision making (grant no.

J,"Stern, N",,,,"Stern, Nicholas",,,Public economics as if time matters: Climate change and the dynamics of policy,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY; POVERTY; UTILITY; FUTURE; WORK,"Tony Atkinson played a crucial role in shaping modern public economics, but throughout his life challenged whether we were making the right assumptions and were building models which captured the essence of the issues under examination. This paper examines questions discussed with Tony concerning public policy to foster change where the pace and nature of change are critical to any serious policy assessment. The primary example is climate change. The paper argues that subjects such as the dynamics of innovation, of potentially immense and destabilising risks, and of political economy, together with technicalities around non-linearities and dynamic increasing returns, all of which are at the heart of the challenge of climate change, will require a series of focused models for their investigation. Attempts to build integrated assessment models (IAMB) for the analysis of climate change have been largely misplaced and omit key effects and questions of the above kind. Intertemporal issues and values are at the core of policy towards climate change and the paper shows that much of the intertemporal economic analysis of the issues around climate change has been misguided and has ridden roughshod over the analytical underpinnings and the underlying ethics of discounting. Where major decline is possible, discounting is fiercely endogenous; and where capital markets are imperfect and risk intense, discount rates cannot be read off from markets. Notwithstanding the modelling difficulties and the challenging research agenda, the paper argues that the urgency of the problem (for example, world infrastructure will double in the next 15-20 years and there are major dangers of lock-in of dirty and damaging capital) require strong action and we know enough about policy to begin travelling down the path of an attractive low-carbon transition.

EQ-5D and ASCOT are useful for examining cost-effectiveness within the health and social care sectors, respectively, but there is a policy need to understand overall benefits and compare across sectors to assess relative value for money. Standard statistical mapping is unsuitable since it relies on conceptual overlap of the measures but EQ-5D and ASCOT have different conceptualisations of quality of life. We use a preference-based mapping approach to estimate the exchange rate using common TTO valuations for both measures. A sample of health states from each measure was valued using TTO by 200 members of the UK adult general population. Regression analyses are used to generate separate equations between EQ-5D-3L and ASCOT values using their original value set and TTO values elicited here. These are solved as simultaneous equations to estimate the relationship between EQ-5D-3L and ASCOT. The relationship for moving from ASCOT to EQ-5D-3L is a linear transformation with an intercept of -0.0488 and gradient of 0.978. This enables QALY gains generated by ASCOT and EQ-5D to be compared across different interventions. This paper estimated an exchange rate between ASCOT and EQ-5D-3L using a preference-based mapping approach that does not compromise the descriptive systems of the two measures. This contributes to the development of preference-based mapping through the use of TTO as the common metric used to estimate the exchange rate between measures.","[Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John; Rowen, Donna] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@Sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Stevens, Katherine J/E-4679-2010","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,"We would like to acknowledge all the participants who took part in the valuation interviews.

J,"Swenson, G",,,,"Swenson, Geoffrey",,,The promise and peril of paralegal aid,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Law and development; Legal pluralism; Paralegals; Post-conflict reconstruction; Asia; Timor-Leste,LEGAL PLURALISM; LAW; GOVERNANCE; JUSTICE; GENDER; ACCESS; STATE; POOR; RULE,"Strengthening the rule of law and promoting access to justice in developing countries have been longstanding international policy objectives. However, the standard policy tools, such as technical assistance and material aid, are routinely criticized for failing to achieve their objectives. The rare exception is paralegal aid, which is almost universally lauded by policymakers and scholars as effective in promoting the rule of law and access to justice. This belief, however, rests on a very limited empirical foundation regarding what paralegal programs accomplish and under what theory they operate. This paper critically examines the conventional wisdom surrounding paralegal initiatives through case studies of two successful paralegal programs in post-conflict Timor-Leste that are broadly representative of the type of initiatives commonly implemented in developing countries. These programs did improve access to justice services, bolster choice between dispute resolution forums, and increase local knowledge of progressive norms on human rights and women's rights. Yet, as this article shows, even successful programs can expect to achieve only incremental gains in promoting the rule of law because advances largely depend on alignment with the priorities of powerful state and non-state actors, donors, program implementers, and paralegals themselves. To date, the literature has not acknowledged these limitations. This article addresses this gap by demonstrating that paralegal aid faces multiple challenges that mean paralegals cannot necessarily transcend or modify deep seated norms and power structures. These issues include principal agent-problems due to the extensive delegation required, internal limitations resulting from paralegals' limited authority and independence, and external constraints from state and non-state justice actors. Paralegal programs also face program design, implementation, and sustainability challenges. Consequently, scholars, practitioners, and policymakers need to adopt a more balanced view of paralegal aid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It utilizes the constituency of Youth NGOs: YOUNGO, as a case study to examine the relationship between selection of participatory strategies, power sources (following Nasiritousi et al. in Int Environ Agreem Politics Law Econ 16(1):109-126, 2016), recognition and agency using ego and alter perceptions. It finds that young people's selection of participatory strategies and power sources is shaped by the level of agency which they perceive to be available to them. When self-perception of agency is high, young participants offer constructive policy amendments which can lead to recognition and agency, though only within certain policy areas and the silos in which they are negotiated. When self-perception of agency is low, youth interpret this as lack of recognition, leading to efforts to assert their relevance and/or to challenge procedural legitimacy: neither of which are well received by decision-makers. In reality, several of the challenges faced by young participants are not structurally unique to their constituency; however, their lack of financial resources does hinder their ability to fully utilize modes of participation which previous studies have found to be beneficial to other NSAs, such as side-events. Financial constraints also restrict the ability of youth participants, many of whom are volunteers, to develop professional relationships with key actors over time, meaning that the level of agency developed by more established, better-resourced NSAs remains largely out of reach. These findings have implications for the understanding of NSA agency, which has previously been treated as homogeneous and raises further questions regarding procedural legitimacy of the UNFCCC and its role in mobilizing and empowering the next generation.","[Thew, Harriet] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Thew, H (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",H.Thew@Leeds.ac.uk,,"Thew, Harriet/0000-0001-8671-7595",,,,,26,33,35,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A validated standardized resource use measure could increase data quality, improve comparability between studies, and reduce research burden. Objectives: To identify a minimum set of core resource use items that should be included in a standardized adult instrument for UK health economic evaluation from a provider perspective. Methods: Health economists with experience of UK-based economic evaluations were recruited to participate in an electronic Delphi survey. Respondents were asked to rate 60 resource use items (e.g., medication names) on a scale of 1 to 9 according to the importance of the item in a generic context. Items considered less important according to predefined consensus criteria were dropped and a second survey was developed. In the second round, respondents received the median score and their own score from round 1 for each item alongside summarized comments and were asked to rerate items. A final project team meeting was held to determine the recommended core set. Results: Forty-five participants completed round 1. Twenty-six items were considered less important and were dropped, 34 items were retained for the second round, and no new items were added. Forty-two respondents (93.3%) completed round 2, and greater consensus was observed. After the final meeting, 10 core items were selected, with further items identified as suitable for bolt-on questionnaire modules. Conclusions: The consensus on 10 items considered important in a generic context suggests that a standardized instrument for core resource use items is feasible.","[Thorn, Joanna C.; Brookes, Sara T.; Riley, Ruth; Noble, Sian M.; Thornton, Gail; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Ridyard, Colin; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Bangor Inst Hlth & Med Res, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England",University of Bristol; Bangor University; University of Oxford,"Thorn, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",joanna.thorn@bristol.ac.uk,"Riley, Ruth/ABA-7824-2021; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254; Riley, Ruth/0000-0001-8774-5344; Noble, Sian/0000-0002-8011-0722; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459","MRC Collaboration and innovation for Difficult and Complex randomized controlled Trials In Invasive procedures [MR/K025643/1]; MRC North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research [MR/K025635/1]; MRC Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research [MR/L004933/1-N57]; Medical Research Council [MR/K025643/1, MR/L004933/2, MR/L004933/1, MR/K025635/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/L004933/1, MR/K025643/1, MR/L004933/2, MR/K025635/1] Funding Source: UKRI",MRC Collaboration and innovation for Difficult and Complex randomized controlled Trials In Invasive procedures(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was undertaken with the support of the MRC Collaboration and innovation for Difficult and Complex randomized controlled Trials In Invasive procedures (grant no.

Yet infrastructure projects in Africa have been frequently shown to fail because planners have neglected their sociopolitical realm. Using the social science literature, this paper derives six political factors that are crucial for African electrification, and incorporates them into a linear, renewable-energy focused bi-criteria optimisation planning model of the African electricity network. The results reveal a significant degree of preventable political risk in the network if the only optimisation criterion is cost minimisation. This cost-minimal solution highly depends on large-scale exports from some of Africa's most politically volatile countries, such as hydroelectric energy from the Democratic Republic of Congo and wind energy from Sudan, Somalia, Chad and Mauritania. However, the model demonstrates that raising the levelised cost of electrification in 2030 by 4% allows to cut preventable political risks of the network by 50%. Crucially, the optimal, most cost-effective risk mitigation strategy is to gradually replace large-scale exports with domestic solar energy abundant in most African countries. High solar energy shares increase national energy sovereignty, meet international climate commitments, and decrease the network's dependence on politically unstable and/or inefficacious countries for generation and transmission.","[Trotter, Philipp A.; McManus, Marcelle C.] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Maconachie, Roy] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Trotter, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",p.trotter@bath.ac.uk,"Trotter, Philipp/T-6260-2019; McManus, Marcelle/C-6828-2009","McManus, Marcelle/0000-0002-0685-8695; Trotter, Philipp/0000-0003-0590-4546",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M507982/1],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge excellent comments and suggestions from Catherine Boone, Evelyn Frank and Hans Pirnay.

We make use of minute by minute GPS tracking data of vehicles and a unique policy of different shopping closure days in different areas of the city, which allows the separation of shopping related congestion effects from commute and other effects. Results show that average speed increased by 18.5% on weekdays when shopping centres were closed.

Methods: Two separate questionnaires were developed to assess stakeholders' perceptions on regulatory and HTA alignment, one for pharmaceutical companies and the other for regulatory and HTA agencies. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Seven regulatory and 8 HTA agencies from Australia, Canada, and Europe and 19 international companies developing innovative medicine responded to the survey. This study provided a snapshot of the current regulatory and HTA landscape. Changes made over the past 5 years were reflected in three main areas: there is an increasing interaction between regulatory and HTA agencies; current conditional regulatory approvals are not always linked with flexible HTA approaches; and companies are more supportive of joint scientific advice. Four types of evidentiary requirements were identified as building blocks for better alignment: acceptable primary end points, inclusion of an active comparator, use of patient-reported outcomes, and choice and use of surrogate end point. Conclusions: The study showed that the gap between regulatory and HTA requirements has narrowed over the past 5 years. All respondents supported synergy between regulatory and HTA stakeholders, and the study provided several recommendations on how to further improve evidentiary alignment including the provision of joint scientific advice, which was rated as a key strategy by both agencies and companies.","[Wang, Ting; McAuslane, Neil; Liberti, Lawrence] Ctr Innovat Regulatory Sci, Friars House,160 Blackfriars Rd, London SE1 8EZ, England; [Wang, Ting; Liberti, Lawrence; Leufkens, Hubert; Hovels, Anke] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Wang, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Innovat Regulatory Sci, Friars House,160 Blackfriars Rd, London SE1 8EZ, England.",twang@cirsci.org,,,,,,,26,29,30,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2018,21,6,,,,,707,714,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.11.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.11.003,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL0GN,29909876,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000436646400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, targeted surveillance of high-risk individuals may be. Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of various surveillance strategies in the UK population, stratified by risk using a simple self-assessment tool scoring between 0 and 67. Methods: A decision model comparing alternative surveillance policies from the perspective of the UK National Health Service over 30 years was developed. The strategy with the highest expected net benefit for each risk score was identified, resulting in a compound risk-stratified policy describing the most cost-effective population wide strategy. The overall expected cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and associated uncertainty were reported. Results: The most cost-effective strategy is for those with a Williams score of 15 to 21 (relative risk [RR] of 0.79-1.60 vs. a mean score of 17 in the United Kingdom) to be offered a one-off full-body skin examination, and for those with a score of 22 or more (RR 1.79+) to be enrolled into a quinquennial monitoring program, rising to annual recall for those with a risk score greater than 43 (RR 20.95+). Expected incremental cost would be 164 million per annum (similar to 0.1% of the National Health Service budget), gaining 15,947 additional QALYs and yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10,199 pound/QALY gained (51.3% probability <30,000) pound. Conclusions: The risk-stratified policy would be expensive to implement but cost-effective compared with typical UK thresholds (20,000- pound 30,000 pound/QALY gained), although decision uncertainty is high. Phased implementation enrolling only higher risk individuals would be substantially less expensive, but with consequent foregone health gain.","[Wilson, Edward C.

An example of this is to inform decisions as to whether to screen for melanoma. A key input is the counterfactual, in this case the natural history of melanoma in patients who are undiagnosed and hence untreated. Objectives: To elicit expert opinion on the probability of disease progression in patients with melanoma that is undetected and hence untreated. Methods: A bespoke webinar-based expert elicitation protocol was administered to 14 participants in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, comprising 12 multinomial questions on the probability of progression from one disease stage to another in the absence of treatment. A modified Connor-Mosimann distribution was fitted to individual responses to each question. Individual responses were pooled using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Participants were asked to provide feedback on the process. Results: A pooled modified Connor-Mosimann distribution was successfully derived from participants' responses. Feedback from participants was generally positive, with 86% willing to take part in such an exercise again. Nevertheless, only 57% of participants felt that this was a valid approach to determine the risk of disease progression. Qualitative feedback reflected some understanding of the need to rely on expert elicitation in the absence of hard data. Conclusions: We successfully elicited and pooled the beliefs of experts in melanoma regarding the probability of disease progression in a format suitable for inclusion in a decision-analytic model.","[Wilson, Edward C.

This paper analyses household survey data and hydrological riverine flood and drought data for 52 countries to find out whether poor people are disproportionally exposed to floods and droughts, and how this exposure may change in a future climate. We find that poor people are often disproportionally exposed to droughts and floods, particularly in urban areas. This pattern does not change significantly under future climate scenarios, although the absolute number of people potentially exposed to floods or droughts can increase or decrease significantly, depending on the scenario and region. In particular, many countries in Africa show a disproportionally high exposure of poor people to floods and droughts. For these hotspots, implementing risk-sensitive land-use and development policies that protect poor people should be a priority.","[Winsemius, Hessel C.] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Winsemius, Hessel C.; Jongman, Brenden; Veldkamp, Ted I.

A number of possible elements, including ordering effects of the valuation tasks, mistakes at the sorting question, and interviewers' (learning) effects, may contribute to their inconsistency. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two modifications on consistency of TTO data in The Netherlands (NL) and Hong Kong (HK): (1) separating the valuation of the Better than Dead (BTD) and Worse than Dead (WTD) states; and (2) Implementation of feedback (FB) module by offering an opportunity to review TTO responses. Methods: A crossover design with two study arms was used to test the effect of the modifications. In each jurisdiction, six interviewers were involved where half the interviewers started using the standard version, and the other half started with the split version. Each version was switched after every 25 (NL) or 30 (HK) interviews until 400 interviews were completed. Results: In the NL and HK, 404 and 403 respondents participated, respectively. With the use of the FB module, the proportion of respondents with inconsistent responses was lowered from 17.8% to 10.6% (P < 0.001) in NL and from 31.8% to 22.3% (P = 0.003) in HK. The result of separating the valuation of BTD and WTD states was not straightforward because it reduced the inconsistency rate in NL but not in HK. Conclusions: The results support implementation of the FB module to promote the consistency of the data. The separation of the BTD and WTD task is not supported.

The findings suggest that the value impact of international diversification depends on a bank's home country: higher levels of diversification are associated with changes in valuations only for banks originating from emerging countries. In addition, the locus of destination of the diversification efforts matters for the direction of effects: while higher levels of intra-regional diversification lead to value enhancement, higher levels of inter-regional diversification seem to induce a negative (but statistically less robust) effect on the valuation of emerging country banks.

We employ a gravity framework on a country-industry-year-level panel data set that matches EXIM authorisations with US bilateral exports. Our results depict the general ineffectiveness of the Bank in promoting exports within and across industries. Some heterogeneities behind the general finding are also uncovered: industries other than aerospace parts and products are more likely to benefit from EXIM authorisations, and EXIM authorisations to larger businesses seem to be more effective in encouraging exports. Furthermore, we find no evidence that EXIM encourages US exports by offsetting foreign ECA competition. These results are neither affected by competing countries' membership to the OECD Arrangement nor by the size of American firms that received EXIM support. Our results cast doubt on the ubiquitously positive claims made by the Bank and its supporters, yetalso provide policy lessons for countries that are either in the inception stages of establishing their own ECAs or are now placing greater importance on ECA financing in encouraging exports.","[Agarwal, Natasha] World Educ Fdn, Oslo, Norway; [Wang, Zheng] De Montfort Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leicester, Leics, England; [Wang, Zheng] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham, England",De Montfort University; University of Nottingham,"Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，World Educ Fdn, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Wang, Zheng/0000-0001-6276-1831",,,,,39,5,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41,5,,,,,1378,1414,,10.1111/twec.12537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12537,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432037100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Agnew, K; Lyons, RC",,,,"Agnew, Kerri; Lyons, Ronan C.",,,The impact of employment on housing prices: Detailed evidence from FDI in Ireland,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing prices; Employment; Foreign direct investment; Ireland; Hedonic regression,LAND VALUES; MOBILITY; CITY; JOBS,"Access to employment is one of the most valuable amenities offered by cities. In urban economics, this is the principal driver of the bid-rent gradient and is a key determinant of housing prices and land values. However, little is known about the causal effect of employment on housing prices, due to the problem of identification. This study presents the first causal estimates of employment changes on housing prices, both sales and rental. It does this by using a purpose-built spatially granular dataset of 1.4 million housing prices and FDI employment, covering Ireland 2007-2013. Identification rests on a combination of rich spatio-temporal variation due to the abundance of FDI in Ireland, a rich set of location controls and an inelastic housing supply in the period covered. The main results show that 1-2 years after 1000 extra jobs have been created, monthly rents in nearby properties will be between 0.5% and 1% higher. The effect on prices is at least 2% but less consistent across specifications. On average, net job creation in export-oriented FDI firms 2009-2013 added roughly 648 million to the stock of wealth of owner occupied real estate and 8 million to the stock of wealth of the rental sector. We also estimate that the aggregate effect of the stock of FDI jobs in 2013 on Irish housing prices is 440 million, or just over 1%.","[Agnew, Kerri; Lyons, Ronan C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, Ronan C.] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Agnew, K (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",kagnew@tcd.ie,,"Agnew, Kerri/0000-0003-0804-3868; Lyons, Ronan/0000-0001-5342-987X",,,,,33,17,17,3,45,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

This allows for a full comparison of the two instruments in terms of their resulting propensity for R&D and equilibrium industry output. In addition, we incorporate an equilibrium welfare analysis. Finally, we investigate a three-stage game wherein a welfare-maximizing regulator sets a socially optimal emission cap under each policy instrument. For the latter game, while closed-form solutions for the subgame-perfect equilibrium are not possible, we establish numerically that the resulting welfare is always larger under a performance standard.","[Amir, Rabah] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Gama, Adriana] El Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Werner, Katarzyna] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Iowa; Colegio de Mexico; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Amir, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",rabah-amir@uiowa.edu; agama@colmex.mx; k.werner@mmu.ac.uk,"Gama, Adriana/W-4989-2019","Werner-Masters, Katarzyna/0000-0003-4874-516X",,,,,21,16,16,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The survey was conducted in four urban areas in England. Participants were asked whether they would cross a road without designated crossing facilities in order to access a cheaper shop or a bus stop on the other side of the road, instead of a more expensive one on their side of the road. This method provides information for the inclusion of severance effects in the appraisal of interventions to change road design and to control motorised traffic. The estimated value per walking trip of reducing the number of vehicle lanes from 3 to 2 and from 2 to 1 is 1.28 pound and 1.00 pound respectively. The value of adding a central reservation (median strip) is 1.08 pound. The value of reducing traffic levels from medium to low and from high to medium is 0.76 pound and 1.08 pound respectively The value of reducing speed limits below 30mph is 0.45 pound. These values depend on age, gender, disability, health condition, mobility restrictions, qualifications, location, and walking behaviour.","[Anciaes, Paulo Rui; Jones, Peter] UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Chadwick Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Metcalfe, Paul James] PJM Econ, 1 Walford Close, Wimborne BH21 1PH, England",University of London; University College London,"Anciaes, PR (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Chadwick Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",p.anciaes@ucl.ac.uk; peter.jones@ucl.ac.uk; paul@pjmeconomics.co.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; Arts and Humanities Research Council [EP/K037323/1]; EPSRC [EP/K037323/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This paper is an output from the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility project, which is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Arts and Humanities Research Council (Grant EP/K037323/1).

If the intertemporal utility function is additively separable, then the latter two concepts are the inverse of each other. We review a theoretical specification with a long lineage in the literature on multi-attribute utility and use this theoretical structure to guide the design of a series of experiments that allow us to identify and estimate intertemporal correlation aversion.

We find an explicit solution for a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which is unique if demand shocks are sufficiently evenly distributed. The equilibrium has a price instability in the sense that a minor change in a supplier's realized cost can result in a drastic change in the market price. We quantify the resulting volatility and show that it is reduced as the size of indivisible units decreases. In the limit, the equilibrium converges to the Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) for divisible goods if costs are common knowledge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We generalize a sufficient condition for existence of equilibrium due to Anesi and Seidmann (2015). We then use this existence result to show that if a weak gradient restriction holds at an alternative, then when players are sufficiently patient, there is a continuum of equilibria with absorbing sets arbitrarily close to that alternative. A sufficient condition for our gradient restriction is that the gradients of all players' utilities are linearly independent at that alternative. When the dimensionality of the set of alternatives is high, this linear independence condition holds at almost all alternatives, and equilibrium absorbing sets are dense in the set of alternatives. This implies that constructive techniques, which are common in the literature, fail to identify many plausible outcomes in dynamic bargaining games.","[Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Nottingham; University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk; dugg@ur.rochester.edu,,"Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594; Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,29,5,5,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper provides an assessment of two key dimensions: the global adoption of MDGs and state capacity. We do so by studying whether they facilitated convergence in income poverty measures, using cross-section and panel methods, with data on 89 developing economies for the period 1990-2013. We find that poverty headcount and gap measures tended to decrease faster in countries with initially higher income poverty. Such convergence accelerated after 2000, suggesting that MDGs adoption was instrumental to poverty reduction. However, this still leaves unexplained substantial variation in poverty reduction performance across countries. Such variation is explained by state capacity: countries with greater ability to administer their territories in 1990 experienced faster income poverty reduction and were more likely to have achieved the MDG target. This result is insensitive to robust regression methods and to a large set of controls (initial level of income, dependence on natural resources, education and health inputs, dependence on foreign aid, ethnic fractionalization, regional effects and a set of governance variables). As good governance and effective institutions are included in the Sustainable Development Goals, this result provides empirical justification for this move, suggesting that more effective states could be crucial to sustain the development progress achieved so far.

The precise mathematical formulation of SR is still scrutinised, but the main purpose is to evaluate the financial distress of a system as a result of the failure of one component of the financial system in question. Many of the mathematical definitions of SR are based on evaluating expectations in extreme regions and therefore, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) represents the key ingredient in producing valuable estimates of SR and even its decomposition per individual components of the entire system. Without doubt, the prescribed dependence model amongst the system components has a major impact over our asymptotic approximations. Thus, this paper considers various well-known dependence models in the EVT literature that allow us to generate SR estimates. Our findings reveal that SR has a significant impact under asymptotic dependence, while weak tail dependence, known as asymptotic independence, produces an insignificant loss over the regulatory capital.","[Asimit, Alexandru V.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",City University London; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",asimit@city.ac.uk; lijinzhu@nankai.edu.cn,"Li, Jinzhu/F-8687-2010; Asimit, Vali/ABC-9324-2022","Asimit, Vali/0000-0002-7706-0066",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11371020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors are very grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their thorough reading of the paper and constructive suggestions.

The first and the second task are implemented with real monetary incentives, while the third concerns all domains in life in general. Like in previous studies, the correlation of decisions across tasks is low and usually statistically non-significant. However, when we consider only subjects whose behavior across the panels of the SG task is compatible with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA), the correlation between HL and self-assessed risk attitude becomes significant. Furthermore, the correlation between HL and SG also increases for CRRA-compatible subjects, although it remains statistically non-significant.","[Attanasi, Giuseppe] Univ Lille 1, LEM, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Georgantzis, Nikolaos] Burgundy Sch Wine & Spirits Business, Dijon, France; [Georgantzis, Nikolaos] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England; [Rotondi, Valentina] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Vigani, Daria] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; University of Reading; Polytechnic University of Milan; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Attanasi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, LEM, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",giuseppe.attanasi@univ-lille1.fr,"Attanasi, Giuseppe/AAD-2485-2019; Rotondi, Valentina/AAS-1937-2020; Georgantzis, Nikolaos/JNE-2406-2023; Rotondi, Valentina/ABB-2333-2021","Georgantzis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-9697-5368; Rotondi, Valentina/0000-0003-0879-7635; vigani, daria/0000-0002-2431-2952; Attanasi, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0848-5770","European Research Council (ERC) [DU 283953]; project Creative, Sustainable Economies and Societies (CSES); University of Strasbourg IDEX Unistra","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); project Creative, Sustainable Economies and Societies (CSES); University of Strasbourg IDEX Unistra","G.

Using a geographically referenced dataset on new housing developments, this paper estimates how households value accessibility in Mexico City. Results are shown considering road accessibility to formal employment subcenters (private accessibility) and distance to the main public transport stations in the city (public accessibility). Results suggest that accessibility to employment subcenters is valued as an amenity by households but being closer to a Metro station is perceived as a disamenity. Moreover, households located in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of informal workers and with lower education levels give a lower value to private accessibility than households located in neighborhoods with a lower proportion of informal workers or in high-educated neighborhoods. These results are evidence of the existence of spatial segregation in the city where disadvantaged households are segregated, not only because of their economic conditions, but because they are located farther away from employment opportunities. The results in this work stress the importance of thinking about integrated land use and transport policies.","[Atuesta, Laura H.] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ CONACYT, Calle Circuito Tecnopolo 117, Aguascalientes 20313, Mexico; [Ibarra-Olivo, J.

Objectives: To propose a novel methodology for estimating the true prevalence of rare diseases using current incidence adjusted to changing diagnostic practice over time. This article focuses on rare diseases whose diagnosis may have changed over time, and raises the hypothesis that prevalence calculated from current incidence may be higher than diagnosed prevalence, which may lag behind the current disease definition and diagnostic methods. A rare epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet syndrome (DS), is explored as an illustrative example. Methods: A targeted literature review was performed for DS to identify all reported incidence, prevalence, and mortality and depict how diagnostic practice has evolved over time. A conceptual model was developed to calculate prevalence derived from current incidence figures alone (incidence-derived prevalence) or incidence adjusted with factors that cause a diagnostic drag (diagnostic awareness-adjusted prevalence). Results: We identified sufficient publications of incidence and prevalence to test the conceptual model. For pediatric patients with DS, diagnosed prevalence in the field (as reported in current literature) matches incidence-derived prevalence, whereas for adult patients, it is overestimated by incidence-derived prevalence, but not by diagnostic awareness-adjusted prevalence. Conclusions: Care should be taken with current incidence-derived prevalence figures to not overstate the prevalence in rare diseases, as methodological challenges in counting small populations, coupled with advances in rare disease discovery, may cause discrepancies.","[Auvin, Stephane] Univ Paris Diderot, Serv Neurol Pediat, Paris, France; [Irwin, John] Zogenix Int Ltd, Maidenhead, Berks, England; [Abi-Aad, Paul; Battersby, Alysia] Wickenstones, Abingdon, Oxon, England",Universite Paris Cite,"Auvin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, Serv Neurol Pediat, CHU Robert Debre, 48 Blvd Serurier, F-75019 Paris, France.",stephane.auvin@aphp.fr,"Auvin, Stéphane/AAB-7824-2021","Auvin, Stéphane/0000-0003-3874-9749; Battersby, Alysia/0000-0002-0715-6935",,,,,49,41,45,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,501,507,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.002,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753345,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is no independent role for expectations. We show that small variations of that model are consistent with multiple interest rate equilibria, similar to the ones found in Calvo (1988). For distributions of output that are commonly used in the literature, the high interest rate equilibria have properties that make them fragile. Once output is drawn from a distribution with both good and bad times, however, it is possible to have robust high interest rate equilibria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We construct a pseudo-panel of Colombian manufacturing firms for the years of 2000-2009 to study the effects of transportation infrastructure on firm performance in a developing country and find elasticities of output with respect to road infrastructure ranging from 0.13 to 0.15 per cent. This confirms that roads are important for private output growth and, as our results are larger than those reported in the literature for developed countries, that transportation infrastructure is relatively more important for the economy of developing countries. We also identify a one-year time lag with which firms' outputs react to road stock changes. This could be indicative of firms requiring time to adjust their production to road changes. We furthermore identify that the effect of road infrastructure is particularly large for heavy manufacturing industries. Moreover, we investigate the regional heterogeneity of the role of transportation infrastructure for firms' output growth. Our results are robust to different econometric concerns. We additionally provide Monte Carlo simulations to support the validity of pseudo-panels in the context of firm-level data.","[Barzin, Samira; Graham, Daniel J.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [D'Costa, Sabine] Univ Westminster, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London NW1 5LS, England",University of London; University College London; Imperial College London; University of Westminster,"Barzin, S (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.barzin12@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737","Railway and Transport Strategy Centre (RTSC) at The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine","Railway and Transport Strategy Centre (RTSC) at The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine","This work was conducted as part of Ms. Samira Barzin's doctoral studies and was not supported by a project specific grant.

Using a Cournot duopoly setup, we investigate the effects of centralised and decentralised labour unions on product innovation. We show that if the products are symmetrically differentiated, the incentive for innovation is higher under decentralised labour unions, whereas the innovation incentive can be higher under a centralised labour union if the products are asymmetrically differentiated.

Bargaining outcomes are determined by upstream market power and countervailing buyer power downstream. This paper uses a panel of B2B transactions in the UK brick market to study B2B transaction prices. The empirical analysis identifies three effects on prices: nonlinear volume and freight absorption effects; countervailing power effects that arise from buyers' local commercial significance; and competition effects that are due to the buyers' local potential suppliers. And it shows that small buyers benefit more from competition than do large buyers because they are not constrained by the suppliers' capacity.,"[Beckert, Walter] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Beckert, W (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",w.beckert@bbk.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007421/1]; ESRC [ES/M007421/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007421/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is a non-structural companion paper to my structural work with Howard Smith and Yuya Takahashi.

We show that the set of equilibria derived under not-too-tight solvency constraints (Alvarez and Jermann, 2000) commonly used in the literature is of measure zero in the whole set of Perfect Bayesian Equilibria. There exist a continuum of stationary equilibria, a continuum of endogenous credit cycles of any periodicity, and a continuum of sunspot equilibria, irrespective of the assumed trading mechanism. Equilibria featuring too-tight solvency constraints can generate growing credit limits over time, periodic credit shutdowns, and heterogeneous debt limits across ex-ante identical borrowers. Moreover, we provide examples of credit cycles that dominate, from a social welfare point of view, all equilibria with not-too-tight solvency constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

First, we demonstrate that microeconomic uncertainty rises sharply during recessions, including during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Second, we show that uncertainty shocks can generate drops in gross domestic product of around 2.5% in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms. However, we also find that uncertainty shocks need to be supplemented by first-moment shocks to fit consumption over the cycle. So our data and simulations suggest recessions are best modelled as being driven by shocks with a negative first moment and a positive second moment. Finally, we show that increased uncertainty can make first-moment policies, like wage subsidies, temporarily less effective because firms become more cautious in responding to price changes.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Floetotto, Max] McKinsey & Co Inc, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jaimovich, Nir] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Terry, Stephen J.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Stanford University; University of Zurich; Tel Aviv University; University of London; University College London; Boston University,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; max.floetotto@alumni.stanford.edu; nir.jaimovich@uzh.ch; itaysap@post.tau.ac.il; stephent@bu.edu,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019","Terry, Stephen/0000-0002-7692-2074",,,,,79,413,480,19,225,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2018,86,3,,,,,1031,1065,,10.3982/ECTA10927,http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA10927,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GI0XJ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-03-26,WOS:000434093400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exporters may require greater commitment from their employees, such as working particular hours to communicate with partners in different time zones or travelling at short notice, and may therefore disproportionately reward employee flexibility. If women are less flexible, or perceived as such, exporters will exhibit a higher GWG than non-exporters. This hypothesis is examined using matched employer-employee data from the Norwegian manufacturing sector for 1996-2010. The results suggest a firm's entry into exporting increases the GWG by about 3 percentage points for college educated workers. A lower overlap in business hours between the Norwegian exporter and its foreign markets and a greater need for interactions with foreign buyers are associated with a higher GWG.

We argue that oil-dependent economies have incentives to transfer arms to oil-rich countries to reduce their risk of instability and, as a result, the chances of disruption in the oil industry. We employ gravity models of the arms trade and estimate the effect of both a local as well as a global oil dependence. Two key results emerge. First, the volume of arms transfers to a specific country is affected by the degree of dependence on its supply of oil. Second, global oil dependence motivates arms export to oil-rich countries even in absence of a direct bilateral oil-for-weapons exchange. Our results point consistently toward the conclusion that the arms trade is an effective foreign policy tool to securing and maintaining access to oil.","[Bove, Vincenzo] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Deiana, Claudio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; [Nistico, Roberto] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Nistico, Roberto] CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Warwick; European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Naples Federico II,"Deiana, C (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium.",claudio.deiana@ec.europa.eu,"Nisticò, Roberto/O-7522-2019; Bove, Vincenzo/O-2279-2019","Nisticò, Roberto/0000-0002-8589-3703; DEIANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-2576-9997",,,,,44,23,23,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Using the US O*NET database and its definition of green jobs, 19.4% of US workers could currently be part of the green economy in a broad sense, although a large proportion of green employment would be 'indirectly' green, comprising existing jobs that are expected to be in high demand due to greening, but do not require significant changes in tasks, skills, or knowledge. Analysis of task content also shows that green jobs vary in 'greenness', with very few jobs only consisting of green tasks, suggesting that the term 'green' should be considered a continuum rather than a binary characteristic. While it is easier to transition to indirectly green rather than directly green jobs, greening is likely to involve transitions on a similar scale and scope of existing job transitions. Non-green jobs generally appear to differ from their green counterparts in only a few skill-specific aspects, suggesting that most re-training can happen on-the-job. Network analysis shows that the green economy offers a large potential for short-run growth if job transitions are strategically managed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

His income-based estimates start with the daily real wages of adult males and assume that days worked per year were constant. Those advanced in British economic growth make no such assumption and instead are built up from the output side. They correlate better with population trends and are consistent with an economy slowly growing and becoming richer. Clark's denial that such growth occurred, his assertion that substantially more land must have been under arable cultivation, his belief that conditions of full employment invariably prevailed in the countryside at harvest time, his concern that the wage bill would have exceeded the value of output in British economic growth, his refusal to consider the possibility that the working year was of variable length, and his assertion that output per acre must have been equalized across arable and pasture are all shown to be figments of his Malthus delusion'.","[Broadberry, Stephen] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Campbell, Bruce M.

The implied differential border-town welfare gains are related non-monotonically to town size, peaking at a population level of about 150,000.","[Brulhart, Marius] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Brulhart, Marius; Carrere, Celine; Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] CEPR, London, England; [Carrere, Celine] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, CH-1204 Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrere, Celine; Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, CH-1204 Geneva, Switzerland; [Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Brülhart, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Marius.Brulhart@unil.ch; celine.carrere@unige.ch; Frederic.Robert-Nicoud@unige.ch,,"Brulhart, Marius/0000-0001-5483-0219; Robert-Nicoud, Frederic/0000-0003-2241-1946","Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR Trade Regulation) [147668, PDFMP1-123133]; Austrian National Science Research Network 'Labor and Welfare State' of the Austrian FWF; National Institute on Aging [R21AG037891]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PDFMP1-123133] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR Trade Regulation); Austrian National Science Research Network 'Labor and Welfare State' of the Austrian FWF; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are grateful to the Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR Trade Regulation, Sinergia grant 147668, and grant PDFMP1-123133) and to the Austrian National Science Research Network 'Labor and Welfare State' of the Austrian FWF and the National Institute on Aging (R21AG037891) for financial support.

We have reviewed 52 quantitative studies, released between 2000 and 2015 and codified 1,133 estimates. We run a regression of regressions which measures the strength of the FDI-productivity relationship. Taking advantage of large number of high-quality studies on FDI and its role in explaining the growth in firms' productivity in Europe, we adopt recent meta-regression analysis methodsfunnel asymmetry and precision estimate tests and precision-effect estimate with standard errorsto explain the heterogeneous impact of FDI. This paper assesses the country-specific impact of FDI on firms' performance, after taking publication selection bias, econometric modelling and the individual studies' characteristics fully into account. Our results show that on average FDI has a positive indirect impact on productivity. The impact is especially significant in selected European countries, and we interpret this as a sign of better absorptive capacities in those countries.","[Bruno, Randolph Luca] UCL, London, England; [Bruno, Randolph Luca] Rodolfo DeBenedetti Fdn, Milan, Italy; [Bruno, Randolph Luca] IZA Bonn Inst Labor, Bonn, Germany; [Cipollina, Maria] Univ Molise, Campobasso, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Molise,"Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，Rodolfo DeBenedetti Fdn, Milan, Italy.;Bruno, RL (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn Inst Labor, Bonn, Germany.",,"Bruno, Randolph Luca/I-3301-2019; Cipollina, Maria/A-9809-2016","Bruno, Randolph Luca/0000-0002-3436-5046; Cipollina, Maria/0000-0002-1454-4039",,,,,114,10,12,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41,5,,,,,1342,1377,,10.1111/twec.12587,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12587,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432037100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relying on the housing-cost-induced-poverty definition, this paper identifies three dimensions of fuel poverty: 1) income-poverty-high-cost; 2) housing-cost induced-poverty-high-cost; and, 3) fuel-cost-induced-poverty-high-cost. After breaking down the underlying structure of the low-income-high-cost framework, this paper proposes an alternative conceptual definition of fuel poverty and puts forward an empirical strategy which can help to identify the households most in need of financial and energy-related support.

Methods: Subjects suffering from chronic health conditions causing daily pain or discomfort were invited to participate in this single-site, single visit, three-way crossover study. Association between individual item and instrument subscale scores was assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its CI. Participant attitudes toward the use of BYOD in a clinical trial were assessed through use of a questionnaire. Results: In this study, 155 subjects (females 83 [54%]; males 72 [46%]) ages 19 to 69 years (mean +/- SD: 48.6 +/- 13.1) were recruited. High association between the modes of administration (paper, BYOD, site device) was shown with analysis of ICCs (0.79-0.98) for each response scale type, including visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, verbal response scale, and Likert scale. Of the subjects, 94% (146 of 155) stated that they would definitely or probably be willing to download an app onto their own mobile device for a forthcoming clinical trial. Forty-five percent of subjects felt BYOD would be more convenient compared with 15% preferring a provisioned device (40% had no preference). Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence supporting the use of BYOD for PROM collection in terms of the conservation of instrument measurement equivalence across the most widely used response scale types, and high patient acceptance of the approach.","[Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, N Wales, PA USA; [Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England; [Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, Dublin, Ireland; [McDowell, Bryan; Sohn, Jeremy] Nouartis Pharmaceut, Basel, Switzerland; [Hogan, Kyle; Belmont, Ryan] Clin Ink, Winston Salem, NC USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; ICON plc,"Byrom, B (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England.",bill.byrom@iconplc.com,"Muehlhausen, Willie/ABE-1666-2020","Mc Carthy, Marie/0000-0003-2730-0233",,,,,11,26,27,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,581,589,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.008,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753356,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

For the first time the analysis is carried out using comparable and representative sets of data sourced by official business registers of an important number of countries. We show that there exists a robust negative relation between growth volatility and size with an average elasticity equal to -0.18. We check the robustness of this result against a number of potential sources of bias and in particular with respect to sectoral disaggregation and against the inclusion of firm age. Our result is consistent with the idea that independently from specific country characteristics there exists a common underlying mechanism driving the elasticity between size and growth volatility. We then propose two mechanisms able to explain our result and we conclude discussing its relevance with respect to the recent literature on granularity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

More precisely, the short-run effects of a depreciation on the trade balance (TB) are analyzed in 27 industries covered by the Pacific Alliance Group free trade agreement. The S-curve found in sectors representing 30 percent of total industrial production suggests that in these cases competitive devaluations have a positive effect on the TB in the short run. Our findings have important policy implications: since only large competitive devaluations can restore TB equilibrium, industrial restructuring would appear to be a more sensible strategy, though this cannot be achieved in the short run and is instead a medium- to long-term goal.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Costamagna, Rodrigo] Univ Savana, INALDE Business Sch, Km 7, Costado Occidental, Chia, Colombia; [Rossini, Gustavo] Univ Nacl Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina",Brunel University; National University of the Littoral,"Costamagna, R (通讯作者)，Univ Savana, INALDE Business Sch, Km 7, Costado Occidental, Chia, Colombia.",Rodrigo.costamagna@inalde.edu.co,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We propose an analytically solvable multi-country model of endogenous selection in which dominant exporters, dominant products and dominant buyers emerge in parallel as multi-product sellers with heterogeneous technologies compete for buyers with heterogeneous needs. The model not only provides an explanation of the existence of dominant buyers but also makes specific predictions on how the relative importance of dominant buyers should vary across export destinations depending on their market size and accessibility.

We first set up a model of collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign currency with international financial intermediation in which a change in leverage of global intermediaries leads to an international credit supply increase. In this environment, we illustrate how house price increases and exchange rates appreciations contribute to fueling the boom by inflating the value of collateral. We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock, and show that country differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of foreign currency denominated credit.

Imported inputs are an important source of technology inflows. Previous research on the implications of imported inputs overlooked their potential effect on the demand for managing the new incoming knowledge. Adopting the case of India, this paper presents a first empirical attempt to fill this gap. Using detailed firm-level data that uniquely distinguishes between the compensations of managers and non-managers, and exploiting the exogenous nature of India's Eight-Plan trade reform, we investigate the potential causal link between input-trade liberalization and the demand for managers relative to non-managers. We find that a decrease in input tariffs increases the relative demand for managers, primarily in domestic firms that use the imported inputs to produce intermediate goods. Specifically, a 10% drop in input tariffs induces, on average, a 1-1.5% increase in the compensation share of managers, manifested via increases in both their number as well as average wages and bonuses. These patterns are: (i) observed across the firms' size distribution; (ii) applicable for both exporting and non-exporting firms; (iii) stronger in family-run firms that operate under flexible labor market regulations; (iv) relatively more dominant in the short-run. In addition, we show that unlike changes in input tariffs, import competition does not affect the relative demand for managers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The assumption is that technological/cultural evolution will soon entirely substitute for the biological processes which underlie human existence and, by analogy, the existence of other independently evolved intelligent beings, if any. Various modes of postbiological evolution of humans have been envisioned in both fictional and discursive contexts (uploading, cyborgization, technological singularity, etc.). Little thought has been devoted so far to the question whether these postbiological modes are truly final in both logical and conceptual terms. What lies beyond the postbiological realm? Clearly, only a few radical speculations on the topic can be offered. In this paper, it is argued that in a sufficiently broad subset of scenarios for postbiological evolution there will be a kind of reverse trend: the one of reintegration with the (astro)biological universe, by that point understood in a much wider and more inclusive sense. The argument for such reintegration could be understood through the metaphor of expanding Klein bottle as a symbolic image of the post-postbiological evolutionary trajectories. This kind of trajectory will lead to the state in which products of culture are indistinguishable from the natural environment, suggesting practical consequences for our SETI efforts.","[Cirkovic, Milan M.] Astron Observ Belgrade, Volgina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Cirkovic, Milan M.] Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Future Human Inst, Suite 8,Littlegate House,16-17 St Ebbes St, Oxford OX1 1PT, England",University of Oxford,"Cirkovic, MM (通讯作者)，Astron Observ Belgrade, Volgina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",mcirkovic@aob.rs,"Ćirković, Milan M./GWU-9737-2022","Ćirković, Milan M./0000-0002-6634-1321","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [ON176021, ON179048]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","Useful comments of an anonymous referee are hereby acknowledged.

Our new market design simultaneously ensures security of energy supply and ongoing expansion of renewable energy (RE). The methodological approach applied considers the special challenges resulting from the intermittent nature of RE we simulate developments in the German electricity market between 2015 and 2034 and differentiate across various power plant technologies according to their ability to flexibly react to changes in the residual load. In theory, a composition of power plants that is optimally adapted to residual load always leads to the most cost efficient supply of electricity. However, our empirical analysis demonstrates that this does not necessarily lead to an improved market environment, both in terms of power plant profitability as well as uninterrupted power supply.","[Coester, Andreas; Hofkes, Marjan W.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hofkes, Marjan W.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Papyrakis, Elissaios] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Papyrakis, Elissaios] UEA, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR2 4AG, Norfolk, England",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of East Anglia,"Coester, A (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",andreas.coester@gmx.de,"Papyrakis, Elissaios/M-9120-2013; Hofkes, Marjan/L-1281-2013","Hofkes, Marjan/0000-0001-8185-8014",,,,,63,23,24,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116,,,,,,312,322,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.020,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430758200034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Differences in the severity levels can be subtle, and confusion about which is 'worse' can lead to logically inconsistent valuation data. A solution could be to mimic the way patients self-report health, where the ordinal structure of levels is clear. We develop and test the feasibility of presenting EQ-5D-5L health states in the 'context' of the entire EQ-5D-5L descriptive system. An online two-arm discrete choice experiment was conducted in the UK (n = 993). Respondents were randomly allocated to a control (standard presentation) or 'context' arm. Each respondent completed 16 paired comparison tasks and feedback questions about the tasks. Differences across arms were assessed using regression analyses. Presenting health states 'in context' can significantly reduce the selection of logically dominated health states, particularly for labels 'severe' and 'extreme' (chi(2) = 46.02, p < 0.001). Preferences differ significantly between arms (likelihood ratio statistic = 42.00, p < 0.05). Comparing conditional logit modeling results, coefficients are ordered as expected for both arms, but the magnitude of decrements between levels is larger for the context arm. Health state presentation is a key consideration in the design of valuation studies. Presenting health states 'in context' affects valuation data and reduces logical inconsistencies. Our results could have implications for other valuation tasks such as time trade-off, and for the valuation of other preference-based measures.","[Cole, Amanda; Shah, Koonal; Feng, Yan; Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, Southside 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Shah, K (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, Southside 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",kshah@ohe.org,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Cole, Amanda/M-3752-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Cole, Amanda/0000-0001-6179-7752; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",EuroQol Research Foundation,EuroQol Research Foundation,"This study was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation.

NICE commissioned Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC) as an independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) to provide a critique of the manufacturer's submitted evidence. Reslizumab is compared with best standard of care and omalizumab, for a small 'overlap' population of patients who have both eosinophilic and IgE-mediated severe asthma. This paper provides a summary of the ERG's review of the manufacturer's submission, and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in August 2017). The ERG considered that there were limitations in the approach proposed by the manufacturer for the exacerbation rate and the utility for severe exacerbation. The company amended their initial analysis, following comments from the ERG and the NICE committee, whereby the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was A 29,870 pound per QALY gained for reslizumab compared with best standard care. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) concluded that reslizumab was recommended as an option for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma that is inadequately controlled in adults despite maintenance therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another drug, only if (1) the blood eosinophil count has been recorded as 400 cells per microlitre or more and (2) the patient has had three or more asthma exacerbations in the past 12 months, and (3) the company provides reslizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.","[Cooper, Keith; Frampton, Geoff; Harris, Petra; Rose, Micah; Chorozoglou, Maria; Pickett, Karen] Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Fac Med, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Cooper, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Fac Med, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England.",kc@soton.ac.uk,"Frampton, Geoff/B-5818-2017","Frampton, Geoff/0000-0003-2005-0497; Cooper, Keith/0000-0002-0318-7670; Chorozoglou, Maria/0000-0001-5070-4653; Pickett, Karen/0000-0002-8631-6465",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme [15/121/14],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme as Project number 15/121/14.,,16,12,13,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36,5,,,,,545,553,,10.1007/s40273-017-0608-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0608-z,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29582406,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430399300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on evidence from the literature on philanthropic behaviour, we argue that funder behaviour is likely to be driven by a combination of intrinsic, extrinsic and image enhancement motivations. We undertake an empirical investigation into the relationships between these factors by analysing data from an online rewards-based crowdfunding platform. These data not only reveal the monetary values of individual contributions to fundraising campaigns but also indicate particular combinations of motivations based on the material reward selected (if any) and the decision as to whether or not to contribute anonymously. We find that extrinsically motivated funders generally make larger contributions than intrinsically motivated funders, which does not suggest the presence of a crowding-out' effect given the presence of material incentives. We further show that named funders with intrinsic motivations contribute more than anonymous funders with intrinsic motivations, whereas the same pattern of behaviour is not observed among extrinsically motivated funders. The evidence from our study therefore suggests that image concerns interact with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in different ways.","[Cox, Joe; Thang Nguyen] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Kang, Soong Moon] UCL, UCL Sch Management, London, England",University of Portsmouth; University of London; University College London,"Nguyen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",thang.nguyen@port.ac.uk,,"Cox, Joe/0000-0001-7806-1194; Nguyen, Thang/0000-0001-5370-8545",,,,,34,20,22,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2018,71,2,,,,,187,212,,10.1111/kykl.12167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/kykl.12167,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD4JG,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430468800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also provide evidence that ethnic favoritism is partly motivated by electoral concerns and more prevalent in the presence of ethnic parties.","[De Luca, Giacomo] Univ York, Dept Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hodler, Roland] Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, CEPR, London, Germany; [Hodler, Roland] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Raschky, Paul A.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Valsecchi, Michele] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; [De Luca, Giacomo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Louvain, Belgium; [De Luca, Giacomo] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",University of York - UK; Ifo Institut; Monash University; New Economic School; KU Leuven; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Valsecchi, M (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia.",giacomo.deluca@york.ac.uk; roland.hodler@unisg.ch; paul.raschky@monash.edu; mvalsecchi@nes.ru,,"Hodler, Roland/0000-0001-8402-8243; Raschky, Paul/0000-0002-8033-2958",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP150100061]; Wallander and Hedelius scholarship [W2013:0093]; GCGD scholarship,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Wallander and Hedelius scholarship; GCGD scholarship,"We thank Daron Acemoglu, Tim Besley, Richard Bluhm, Alessandro Gavazza, Masayuki Kudamatsu, Stelios Michalopoulos, Gerard Padro i Miquel, Torsten Persson, David Stromberg, Francesco Trebbi and Yogesh Uppal as well as conference and seminar participants at IIES Stockholm (2014), STICERD-LSE (2014), University of Manchester (2014), CESifo Conference on Public Sector Economics (2015), University of Hannover (2015), Workshop of Applied Economics in Petralia (2015), University of Alicante (2015), NBER Political Economy Workshop (2015), Econometric Society World Congress (2015), University of Konstanz (2015), NEUDC (2015), ASWEDE Workshop (2016), KU Leuven (2016), Trinity College of Dublin (2017), University of Kent (2017), Collegio Carlo Alberto (2017), Bocconi University (2017), MIT (2017) and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (2017) for helpful comments and discussions.

In every period until its discovery, the players decide how much of the unsearched area to comb. If a player finds the prize alone he wins it and the game ends. Players have a per-period discount factor and costs proportional to the area they search. First, as a benchmark for efficiency, we solve the one-player search problem. Second, in the two-player setting we show that typically there is inefficient over-search - a result akin to the tragedy of the commons. However, for players with intermediate levels of patience, there is the possibility of inefficient under-search as players incorporate the expected future payoffs in their current search decisions. Finally, with patient players, several counterintuitive results can arise: for example, players might be better off searching a larger island or looking for a less valuable prize.

We generate a panel of attitudes in urban Pakistan, in which respondents are randomly exposed to fact-based statements describing the US in either a positive or negative light. Anti-American sentiment is high and heterogenous in our sample at the baseline, and systematically correlated with intended behavior (such as intended migration to the US). We find that revised attitudes are significantly different from baseline attitudes: attitudes are, on average, revised upward (downward) upon receipt of positive (negative) information, indicating that providing information had a meaningful effect on US favorability. The within-subject design and data on respondents' priors allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We find that revisions are largely a result of salience-based updating. We reject unbiased information-based updating as the only source of revisions. In addition, a substantial proportion of individuals do not respond to the information. This heterogeneity in revision processes means that there is no convergence in attitudes following the provision of information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper demonstrates a new margin of adjustment, namely, provision of trade credit. A simple model predicts that an increase in competitive pressures will lead exporters to provide trade credit and lower prices and that the price adjustment will be attenuated by trade credit provision. These predictions are tested in the context of an exogenous shock, the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), a quota system governing trade in textiles and clothing until the end-2004. The analysis focuses on Turkey which was not subject to quotas in the EU and thus faced an increase in competition after the quotas on China had been removed. The results suggest that in the post-MFA period Turkish exports of products with binding MFA quotas prior to the shock saw an increase in the provision of trade credit and a drop in prices relative to the other products. There is also evidence that provision of trade credit generated a dampening effect on the price response to the increase in competition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption, and investment, and a negative effect on the total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. Besides explicitly incorporating a double role of commodity prices, the model structure nests the various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around 42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively. We find transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the contribution of shocks to the trend, which, though smaller, is not negligible.

In parallel, both the EU and various European countries are exploring new mechanisms to mobilise funding to support biodiversity conservation. We develop a proposal for an EFT design within the supranational context of the EU and assess its potential effects with evidence-based estimates. We i) provide both a theoretical underpinning and a synthesis of the current EFT schemes and EU Nature Directives, ii) propose a model for EFT implementation within the existing EU funding mechanisms based on quantitative and qualitative conservation indicators, iii) analyse how resulting payments would be (spatially) distributed among European regions, and iv) discuss the model outcomes in terms of ecological effectiveness, distributive effects and cost-effectiveness. We thereby contribute to the debate about how to better integrate ecological public functions within multi-level and supra-national governance structures.","[Droste, N.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Droste, N.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Droste, N.] FLACSO Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Dept Dev Environm & Terr, Ave Diego de Almagro, Quito 170201, Ecuador; [Ring, I.] Tech Univ Dresden, Int Inst Zittau, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany; [Santos, R.] NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Kettunen, M.] IEEP, 11 Belgrave Rd,IEEP Off,Floor 3, London SW1V 1RB, England",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Technische Universitat Dresden; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Droste, N (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;Droste, N (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Germany.;Droste, N (通讯作者)，FLACSO Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Dept Dev Environm & Terr, Ave Diego de Almagro, Quito 170201, Ecuador.",nils.droste@ufz.de; irene.ring@tu-dresden.de; rfs@fct.unl.pt; MKettunen@ieep.eu,"Droste, Nils/I-2449-2019; Santos, Rui/Q-6837-2016","Droste, Nils/0000-0003-4357-9115; Santos, Rui/0000-0003-2829-6475; Ring, Irene/0000-0002-2688-8947",Heinrich-Boll Foundation [P118873]; [07.0202.2015.712612/ETU/ENV.B.3],Heinrich-Boll Foundation;,We thank three anonymous reviewers and editor Janne Hukkinen for constructive and helpful feedback.

We propose a new selection criterion that imposes no restrictions on beliefs: we select the action profile that is supported in equilibrium by the largest set of beliefs.

Using insights from expert interviews, it highlights multiple trade-offs between innovative pricing approaches and regulatory principles which might be resolved by a political decision on how the costs should be recovered or socialised. It then identifies four essentials for a successful implementation of a new mechanism: (1) Closer collaboration between TSO and DNO/DSO concerning local dispatch to improve system efficiency. (ii) Installation of smart meters to collect data providing information about the actual contribution to the grid utilisation of each customer. (iii) Intensified cooperation between supplier and DNO/DSO to pass-through the price signal on the electricity bill. (iv) A legislative framework to facilitate data sharing and data management and communication among network stakeholders - essentially a relaxation of current privacy legislation as an enabler for new approaches to network management, and potentially to reduce costs to the consumer. This suggests the focus for future network pricing should be on services and functions provided by the grid rather than on the commodity power itself.","[Faerber, Laura Antonia] Advisory House GmbH, Malkastenstr 17, D-40211 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Balta-Ozkan, Nazmiye] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Connor, Peter M.] Univ Exeter, Penryn Campus,Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",Cranfield University; University of Exeter,"Balta-Ozkan, N (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",n.ozkan@cranfield.ac.uk,"Connor, Peter M/C-6080-2009","ozkan, nazmiye/0000-0002-2848-5535",,,,,50,23,23,3,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116,,,,,,210,219,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.010,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430758200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Favara, M",,,,"Favara, Marta",,,Maternal group participation and child nutritional status in Peru,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,4 DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MENTAL-HEALTH; MOTHERS; INDIA; ASSOCIATION; HOUSEHOLD; MORTALITY; ETHIOPIA,"Using data from the Peruvian sample of the Young Lives study, this paper investigates the association between maternal group participation and child nutritional status at the ages of 1 and 5 years. This study finds that the relationship between child nutrition and maternal group participation depends on the level of maternal education. In fact, maternal group participation is positively associated with child height-for-age when children were 1 year old, for those children whose mothers had had no formal education. This same association fades at 5 years of age. Maternal group participation may affect child nutrition through a number of mechanisms. This paper provides suggestive evidence on the positive role that this participation might play in promoting better breastfeeding practice and a more secure mother-child bond and in easing mothers' access to additional resources and support.","[Favara, Marta] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Favara, Marta] IZA Inst Lab Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Oxford; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Favara, M (通讯作者)，Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",marta.favara@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Favara, Marta/0000-0002-5764-4654",,,,,34,0,0,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.
