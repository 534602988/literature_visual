This paper quantifies foreign competition threats by exploiting news of potential multinational investments from over 35,000 media outlets around the world. Using firm-specific measures of foreign competition threat, the analysis shows that domestic firms respond by upgrading productivity, raising innovation, and altering product composition. However, there is a U-shape relationship between initial productivity and productivity growth where the right and left tails upgrade productivity through innovation and product dropping, respectively. These responses constitute an economically important source of gains and convey new implications for the timing of economic policies.","[Bao, Cathy Ge] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Qiuzhen Hall 427,10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Maggie Xiaoyang] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St NW,Suite 367, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of International Business & Economics; George Washington University,"Bao, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Qiuzhen Hall 427,10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",baoge@uibe.edu.cn; xchen@gwu.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703021]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities at UIBE [16QN03],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities at UIBE,"We are very grateful to Nick Bloom, Jonathan Eaton, Amit Khandelwal, Bill Lincoln, Aaditya Mattoo, Marc Melitz, Patricia Tovar, Stephen Yeaple, and session and seminar participants at the World Bank, American Economic Association Meeting, XIV Annual Conference of the Euro-Latin Study Network on Integration and Trade, University of Texas at Austin, and Washington Area International Trade Symposium for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Finns meet stochastic investment opportunities and face endogenous credit constraints. They are not fully committed to repaying debt. Credit constraints are derived from incentive constraints in optimal contracts which ensure default never occurs in equilibrium. Stock price bubbles can emerge through a positive feedback loop mechanism and cannot be ruled out by transversality conditions. These bubbles command a liquidity premium and raise investment by raising the debt limit. Their collapse leads to a recession and a stock market crash.,"[Miao, Jianjun] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Miao, Jianjun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, CICFS, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengfei] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Boston University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Miao, JJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Miao, JJ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, CICFS, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China.",miaoj@bu.edu; pfwang@ust.hk,,,"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [16515216, 693513]",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of John Leahy, Coeditor.

This paper investigates the contagion from oil prices to Chinese stock sectors by considering differences between extreme positive returns and extreme negative returns. We compute time-varying cut-offs by employing a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) function to estimate excess returns. We then use a multinomial logit (MNL) model to examine the probability of Chinese stock sector co-exceedances associated with oil price exceedances. Our results indicate that, compared to common domestic factors, the contagion between oil price and stock sectors is relatively weak, but never negligible. We argue that faced with volatile oil prices during turbulent periods, the existence of any contagion weakens the benefits of portfolio diversification related to oil and Chinese stock sector investment. Based on our findings, investors holding a portfolio of oil and Chinese sector stocks should pay special attention to the extreme changes in crude oil prices and adopt hedging measures to protect their portfolio from extreme shocks to oil markets.

This paper uses numerical general equilibrium trade model structures to simulate the impacts of transportation costs on welfare and trade for a Canada-US country pair case. We compare two groups of model structures: Armington assumption models and homogeneous goods models. Within these two groups of models, we also compare balanced trade structures to trade imbalance structures and production function transportation costs to iceberg transportation costs. Armington goods models generate more absolute welfare gains from transportation cost elimination than homogeneous goods models. Welfare gains under balanced trade structures are larger in production function transportation cost scenarios than in iceberg transportation cost scenarios, but under trade imbalance structures, welfare gains are greater under iceberg transportation cost scenarios. Canada's welfare gains in the iceberg transportation cost scenario are significantly larger than gains in the production function transportation cost scenario. On trade effects, homogeneous goods models generate more export and import gains, balanced trade structures have more trade variations, and iceberg transportation costs generate more trade effects.","[He, Chuantian] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Western Univ, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chundingli@gmail.com,,"He, Chuantian/0000-0001-6118-2707",,,,,31,1,1,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

With the degeneration of rangeland in recent years, sustainability within rangeland ecosystem has become an increasingly important issue. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel dynamic decision-making approach based on hesitant fuzzy information to evaluate rangeland sustainability that considers ecological, social and economic aspects. Firstly, a modified satisfaction degree of alternative is presented, based on which a mathematical model for determining the stage weights is constructed. Secondly, the compromise ratio method (CRM), whose basic principle is that the optimal alternative should have the nearest distance from positive ideal solution and the longest distance from negative ideal solution simultaneously, is extended to accommodate hesitant fuzzy environment, and then adopted to tackle the dynamic decision-making with hesitant fuzzy information. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can eliminate the impact of attribute magnitude and dimension.

Moreover, upstream industry suffers more than downstream industry. The results are robust to a battery of robustness checks. Heterogeneity exists across cities. We find that first- and second-tier cities as well as highly urbanized cities experience great declines in housing prices after the policy's implementation, especially cites that had high housing prices in 2010 and cities with high real estate investment as a proportion of fixed asset investment. However, the housing policy is less effective in curbing speculative demand.","[Wu, Yi] Jinan Univ, Dept Accounting, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Int Sch Business & Finance, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Sun Yat Sen University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, 601 Western Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",angeliawuyi@gmail.com,,"WU, YI/0000-0003-0354-5658; LI, YUNONG/0000-0001-8225-7018","Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","Supported by the Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China.",,30,26,28,7,108,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper we characterize surplus-maximizing (efficient) and revenue-maximizing (optimal) mechanisms in a spectrum sharing context where a principal allocates transmitted power among a group of potentially interested users (transmitter-receiver pairs). Under regularity conditions about value distributions and non-interference constraints, we show that efficiency (optimality) typically involves spectrum sharing by multiple users, and the exact allocation of transmitted power is determined such that the ratio of marginal value (virtual value) over marginal cost (in terms of the cost to the interference generated) is equal among all shared users. We show that efficient and optimal mechanisms in our setting are actually dominant-strategy incentive compatible, and that they can also be implemented by well-designed all-pay or discriminatory-price auctions.

Evidence in the Northern Ireland context has further suggested that applying these models to property markets may be inappropriate given the underlying statistical properties of these time series (Gallagher et al., 2015). These issues combined suggest that there may be merit in examining cases of financial crises through alternative theoretical frameworks and in adopting a more pluralist approach. With this in mind, this paper investigates whether Minsky's (1975, 1986, 1992) Financial Instability Hypothesis can assist in understanding the recent property market crisis in Northern Ireland, which was severe by both national and international standards. Using qualitative evidence to analyse the behaviours of borrowers represented by property developers and lenders represented by banks over the course of the business cycle, this paper assesses the relevance of Minsky's arguments. The findings show that Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis explains the incidents observed in Northern Ireland's property market in recent years.","[Gallagher, Emer Marie] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England; [Ramsey, Elaine] Ulster Univ, Business Sch, Coleraine Campus,Cromore Rd, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Bond, Derek] Hubei Normal Univ, Int Off, Huangshia, Peoples R China",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Ulster University; Hubei Normal University,"Gallagher, EM (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England.",e.m.gallagher@ljmu.ac.uk; e.ramsey@ulster.ac.uk; d.bond.esq@gmail.com,"Bond, Derek/S-3169-2019","RAMSEY, ELAINE/0000-0003-4043-763X",,,,,42,0,0,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In contrast, the VIX index only offered explanatory power up to August 2015. Thereafter, the onshore RMB rate and the difference between the 1-month offshore and onshore RMB forward points have significant impacts on the central parity.

The promotion of business, facilitation of production, and rewards of economic returns are highly correlated stages for efficiency performance. The results suggest that Beijing's government should expend more effort developing the potential to generate outputs given current land and investment inputs. In addition, it provides a tool to strengthen the organisational capacity development of industrial parks by emphasising their multi-dimensions in inputs and outputs, selecting the right competitors at the right organisational stage, locating sources of efficiency and inefficiency, and understanding progression and balance of internal stages during operation.","[Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev & Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Hao, Gaojian] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Tourism & Environm Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhe] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Cambridge; Shaanxi Normal University; Peking University","Cheng, Z (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cz1251@pku.edu.cn,"Cheng, Zhe/AHE-3742-2022","Cheng, Zhe/0000-0002-3777-3934; Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396","Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41530751, 41371008]; Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [2014042]; Shaanxi Normal University",Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS'; Shaanxi Normal University,"The research is sponsored by a grant of the Natural Sciences Foundation of China [grant number 41530751], [grant number 41371008], the support from Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [grant number 2014042]; and the support of Shaanxi Normal University.",,54,11,11,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Whether there is price convergence between regions in one country is an important economic issue according to the Law of One Price (LOP) theory. Compared to previous studies, this article operates with the Sequential Panel Selection Method (SPSM) to explore the non-stationary properties of the LOP in China's regions. We provide robust evidence to specify that the LOP holds true for two-thirds of the provinces in China, mainly in the Western and Central regions. This means that the Eastern region's price fluctuation is non-stationary and that the consumer price index (CPI) levels of the Western, Central and Northeastern regions are relatively convergent in China. The conduction path of the CPI level is from the Eastern region to the other regions. It shows that prices can converge with each other by LOP and the values of the same goods in the Western and Central regions are equal and if there is a price difference, then it can be eliminated by interregional trade.","[Liu, Tie-Ying] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Xiong, De-Ping] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Ocean University of China; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Qingdao University,"Xiong, DP (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",xiondeping@126.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Lin, Ren/0000-0001-9854-0483","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [16YJC790064]","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund","This work was supported by Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [Grant No. 16YJC790064].",,52,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that migrants who have come from within the province differ significantly from those who have come from outside of the province. Using a nested logit model, we find that overall, higher wage differentials, larger population size, higher GDP per capita, and faster employment growth rate are the attributes of a city that attract rural-to-urban migrants. In addition, moving beyond one's home province has a strong deterrent effect on migration, analogous to the border effect identified in international migration studies.

We explore a unique firm-level Chinese Environmental Statistics dataset and utilize a regression discontinuity design to assess the impact of central supervision through the NSMF program on an industrial firm's chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions. The results suggest that central supervision significantly reduces industrial COD emissions by at least 26.8%. These results highlight the substantial room for improvement in Chinese environmental regulations via central supervision. A more flexible environmental decentralization regime and comprehensive central supervision are thus recommended for future reforms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The SIN is constructed in two steps. First, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of regime-switching between a normal market phase represented by a geometric Brownian motion and a bubble regime represented by the stochastic super-exponential Sornette and Andersen (Int J Mod Phys C 13(2):171-188, 2002) bubble model. The calibration of the HMM provides the probability at each time for a given security to be in the bubble regime. Conditional on two assets being qualified in the bubble regime, we then use the transfer entropy to quantify the influence of the returns of one asset i onto another asset j, from which we introduce the adjacency matrix of the SIN among securities. We apply our technology to the Chinese stock market during the period 2005-2008, during which a normal phase was followed by a spectacular bubble ending in a massive correction. We introduce the Net Speculative Influence Intensity variable as the difference between the transfer entropies from i to j and from j to i, which is used in a series of rank ordered regressions to predict the maximum loss (%MaxLoss) endured during the crash. The sectors that influenced other sectors the most are found to have the largest losses. There is some predictability obtained by using the transfer entropy involving industrial sectors to explain the %MaxLoss of financial institutions but not vice versa. We also show that the bubble state variable calibrated on the Chinese market data corresponds well to the regimes when the market exhibits a strong price acceleration followed by clear change of price regimes. Our results suggest that SIN may contribute significant skill to the development of general linkage-based systemic risks measures and early warning metrics.","[Lin, Li] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, 40 Blvd Du Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Lin, Li] East China Univ Technol & Sci, Res Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Lin, L (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Lin, L (通讯作者)，East China Univ Technol & Sci, Res Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",llin@ecust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Founds of China [71301051]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [WN1522007],National Natural Science Founds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),We acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Founds of China (Grant No. 71301051) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. WN1522007).,,74,2,3,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Using highly disaggregated firm-level data, we show that the quality upgrading made possible by China's tariff reductions was concentrated in the least productive Chinese exporters. These firms, which had been laggards in terms of quality prior to the tariff reduction, were the most aggressive in increasing the quality of their exports and their inputs and in redirecting their exports toward high income markets where demand for high quality goods is strong. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model featuring scale effect and non-Hicks' neutral productivity that disproportionately affects the efficiency with which firms use intermediate inputs. This latter feature does not appear in workhorse models of firm heterogeneity and endogenous quality choice which provide a distorted view of the impact of trade liberalization on quality upgrading.

To maximize its effectiveness, the monthly average daily solar radiation (MADSR) should be accurately estimated, and then an accurate MADSR map could be developed for final decisionmakers. However, there is a limitation in improving the accuracy of the MADSR map due to the lack of weather stations. This is because it is too expensive to measure the actual MADSR data using the remote sensors in all the sites where the PV system would be installed. Thus, this study aimed to develop the MADSR map with improved estimation accuracy using the advanced case-based reasoning (A-CBR), finite element method (FEM), and kriging method. This study was conducted in four steps: (i) data collection; (ii) estimation of the MADSR data in the 54 unmeasured locations using the A-CBR model; (iii) estimation of the MADSR data in the 89 unmeasured locations using the FEM model; and (iv) development of the MADSR map using the kriging method.

We employed two types of approaches in our analysis: i) time series and ii) panel data approach. According to the generalized ridge regressions estimated in Bayesian framework, the perceived corruption was a factor that influenced FDI in all the countries. In Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia corruption came through as a serious obstacle for FDIs since 2005, but this was not the case for Hungary. Even if Hungary is perceived as a country with high influence, foreign investors seem no to care about this fact and are more interested in the quality of human resources and the possibility to increase exports. Our panel approach based on a panel ARDL model identified a significant relationship between FDI, corruption index and labour force with advanced education however this causality was only detected in the long run. According to the Granger causality in panel, the attraction of FDI inflows succeeded in generating changes in total tax rate, but the issues related to corruption were not reduced at an acceptable level for foreign investors in Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.","[Su, Weihua; Zhang, Dongcai; Zhang, Chonghui] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Abrham, Josef] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Legal Specializat & Publ Adm, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031, Czech Republic; [Simionescu, Mihaela] Casa Acad, Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13,Septembrie 13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Yaroshevich, Natalya] Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Corp Econ, 62 Vosmogo Marta Str, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Guseva, Valentina] Tyumen Ind Univ, Dept Business Informat & Math, Volodarskogo Str 38, Tyumen 625000, Russia",Zhejiang Gongshang University; Metropolitan University Prague; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Ural State University of Economics; Tyumen Industrial University,"Zhang, CH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhangch1988@zjgsu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023; Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Abrhám, Josef/AAL-8271-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016; Guseva, Valentina/AAM-4555-2020; Yaroshevich, Natalia/AAE-4610-2019","Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358; Abrhám, Josef/0000-0003-2484-8439; Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172;",Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province [17NDJC211YB]; National Natural Science of China [71671165]; First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics),Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics),"This work was supported by the Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province (No. 17NDJC211YB), National Natural Science of China (No. 71671165) and First Class Discipline of Zhejiang - A (Zhejiang Gongshang University - Statistics).",,62,20,20,4,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This premise, however, does not seem validated as there is no consensus in the empirical literature regarding the impact of exchange rate changes on trade flows. We reexamine whether currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using a rich and unique Chinese customs dataset spanning the universe of bilateral Chinese transaction level trades over the 2000 to 2011 period. This dataset allows us to consider firm-level involvement in processing trade and firm-level dynamics in both export and import markets. Key findings of our firm-level estimations of trade elasticities include that the response of Chinese firms to exchanges rate changes depends strongly on the extent to which firms are involved in processing trade, i.e. heterogeneity in the extent of processing trade is crucial to understanding trade elasticities, and that the Chinese trade balance responds strongly to changes in the relative value of the Chinese Yuan, thereby implying that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is significant and that currency depreciations do in fact lead to export growth and trade balance improvement.

Time-varying volatility connectedness characteristics are identified by combining a multivariate heteroscedastic autoregressive (HAR) model with the DCC-GARCH model. The results verify the existence of volatility spillover from the US crude oil market to China's agricultural commodity markets, although the magnitude of this spillover is weak. Furthermore, the realised volatility is decomposed into positive and negative components to identify the asymmetric effect of volatility connectedness. The results show that market interdependence has obviously increased for negative volatility relative to positive volatility, implying that volatility transmission has a leverage effect across markets.

By constructing dynamic investment decision-making model, we find corporate investment heterogeneity in China due to their different dynamic shifts of objective functions, demonstrated by our simulations. Empirical tests imply that the expansion of investment improves financial performance, but does not play a positive role on solving social employment. POEs expanded investment much more than SOEs did, even in the transitional period, but both of them reduced their investment significantly in new normal. Mechanisms are explored by 3-stage structural models for non-matched control group and nearest neighbor PSM matched control group. Although investment inefficiency of SOEs are concerned, executive stock ownership and equity finance could be exotic methods to stimulate efficient investment. Investment efficiency of POEs has been recovered in new normal but POEs have shifted away from 'profit-driving' they used to be in the old normal.","[Zhang, Xiaoqian] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Acad Financial Res, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, XQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",develop21cn@zju.edu.cn,"张, 小茜/K-5057-2019","Shi, Jinchuan/0000-0002-0265-3211; Zhang, Xiaoqian/0000-0003-1631-4971",Ministry of Education's key research base major project [14JJD790010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472167]; Ministry of Education youth project [10YJC790387],Ministry of Education's key research base major project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education youth project,"We thank the editor, Belton Fleisher, and guest editor, Zhijie Xiao, an anonymous referee, Qian Sun, Justin Yifu Lin and Loren Brandt for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Household intertemporal deprivations in these dimensions are estimated using measures which are sensitive to the precise sequence in which poor and non-poor spells occur. A generalised recursive selection model is then proposed to investigate the determinants of intertemporal deprivation in each dimension, allowing for the possibility that correlated unobservables drive the dual deprivations. Improvement in agricultural production is crucial for reducing both dimensions of intertemporal deprivation. We find evidence suggestive of intertemporal income-nutrition poverty traps. Higher labour productivity, especially in agriculture rather than local off-farm activities or out-migration, holds much potential for breaking the vicious circle. Agricultural innovation and mechanisation, regarded by the government as indispensable, yield mixed outcomes for alleviating intertemporal multi-dimensional deprivations.","[You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Roope, Laurence] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; University of Oxford,"Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",jing.you@ruc.edu.cn; wangsg@ruc.edu.cn; laurence.roope@dph.ox.ac.uk,,"Roope, Laurence/0000-0001-9098-9331; You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403282, 71673283]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDC026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors are extremely grateful to Stephan Klasen and Christophe Muller, for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

Prior research demonstrates the effects of switching costs on competition, but ignores the influence of switching costs to firm innovation. So the purpose of this study is to reveal the relationships between switching costs and cost-reducing innovation by considering brand loyalty. All our theoretical conclusions are captured by game theory based on a two-stage duopoly model. The conclusions of this study show that under moderate conditions, switching costs improve competition. Strong firms implement lower price when switching costs are present than when they are not present. Second, at the asymmetric equilibrium, lower-efficiency firms with switching costs launch less innovative investments than do those without switching costs, while higher-efficiency firms with switching costs launch more innovation. But under symmetric equilibrium, switching costs have no effect on innovative investment. The novel contributions of this paper are that we find switching costs and loyalty have vertical impacts on firms' cost-reducing innovation, which extends the theory of switching costs.","[Nie, Pu-yan; Wang, Chan] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ GDUFE, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sci Finance & Ind, Inst Guangdong Econ & Social Dev, Sch Finance, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yong-cong] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Inst Studies Great Bay Area, Guangzhou 510420, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Nie, PY (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ GDUFE, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sci Finance & Ind, Inst Guangdong Econ & Social Dev, Sch Finance, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",pynie.2013@163.com,"NIE, Pu-yan/J-3547-2019","NIE, Pu-yan/0000-0002-6214-5980","National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71771057, 71401057, 71703028]; Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD17XYJ23]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & industry of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]; Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633002, 71333004]",National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & industry of Guangdong Province; Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (71771057, 71401057, 71703028), Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD17XYJ23), Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & industry, and, Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province (2015WCXTD009), and the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71633002; 71333004).",,35,24,24,5,38,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In fact, we find that much of the variation in relative wages across courses is due to the quality of students selected. Once we allow for course selectivity in our analysis we find that our estimates of the effects of attending the most prestigious HEIs is around 10 percentage points lower than otherwise; the effects of attending the middle ranking HEIs is around 5 percentage points lower; and that of attending these lowest ranking HEIs is unaffected.

However, with the global urban population currently generating two-thirds of all carbon emissions, global policymakers are urging mayors and regional leaders to make difficult decisions to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization on the environment. The authors begin their examination of the implications of local and regional factors by applying the Dynamic Spatial Durbin Panel Data Model to empirically examine aspects of developing low-carbon strategies for the rapidly expanding size and number of the world's urban areas. The results indicate that the contribution of urbanization to carbon emissions can be positively affected when regional policy makers collaborate to focus on spillover effects to simultaneously manage the scope, diversity, and complexity of economic and environmental issues from the perspective of creating a balance between rapid urbanization and relevant regional factors. Regional leaders can make a difference by creating both short-term goals and long-term strategies for maintaining low-carbon urbanization, nurturing regional coordination, monitoring and managing eco-friendly regional spillover effects, supporting low-carbon technology innovations, and maintaining optimal city size.","[Niu, Honglei] Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lekse, William] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Xuzhou University of Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Niu, HL (通讯作者)，Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",niuhonglei@126.com,,,China's Ministry of Education [17YJCZH132]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education [2015SJD473]; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development [2014-R4-015]; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System [2014ZD45]; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents,"China's Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents","We would like to thank Professor Shang for her valuable and insightful comments on this manuscript.

This study aims to explore the strategic fit of potential mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese banking industry. When the operations of two banks are jointly analyzed this means that the inputs and the outputs of these two individual banks are somehow combined in an attempt to better understand the sector as a whole. A novel SFA model with Bayesian inference on input/output prices is proposed to assess the impact of business-related variables on efficiency levels. The results not only reveal that bank size, type, and origin present a significant impact on individual technical efficiency levels, but also exert a significant impact on the efficiency frontier of the industry. The strategic fit of M&As in the Chinese banking industry strongly relies on opportunities derived from banking automation that may arise from acquiring technologically obsolete small banks. Big and foreign banks also exert a positive impact on the technological catch-up of Chinese banks, which may suggest opportunities for sector deregulation.","[Chen, Zhongfei] Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wanke, Peter] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Sch Business, Ctr Studies Logist Infrastruct & Management, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Chen, Zhongfei] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Lancaster University; Athens University of Economics & Business; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hongyeczf@163.com; peter@coppead.ufrj.br; m.tsionas@lancaster.ac.uk,"Chen, Zhongfei/L-2323-2019; Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020; Wanke, Peter/G-3184-2010","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Wanke, Peter/0000-0003-1395-8907","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71704065]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620022]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2016A030310083, 2017A030310003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","We thank the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant No. 71704065], the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Grant No. 2017M620022] and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [Grant No. 2016A030310083, Grant No. 2017A030310003].",,50,8,8,0,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Interestingly, China's aid shows a positive effect on its total volume of trade and imports from Africa, while the aid from the US exhibits little impact on the US-Africa total trade and its imports from Africa. A possible explanation for such a difference could be due to the dissimilar national interests of donors in Africa.

We derive a robust dynamic derivative strategy and show that the optimal strategy under ambiguity aversion reduces the exposures to market return risk and volatility risk and that the investor holds opposite positions for the two risk exposures. In the presence of a derivative, ambiguity has distinct effects on the optimal investment strategy. More important, we demonstrate the utility improvement when considering ambiguity and exploiting derivatives and show that ambiguity aversion and derivative trading significantly improve utility when return volatility increases.

Our empirical findings support the view that the contractionary effect of US monetary normalization on global dollar liquidity would be offset by an expansionary effect from continued supply of US dollar loans by euro area and Japanese banks. The net effect, however, is crucially dependent on the stability of global foreign exchange markets and investor perceptions of the default risks of global banks. Our findings show that there could be a significant contraction of the supply of international US dollar loans if and when the US monetary normalization coincides with a dislocation of the FX swap market and a rise of bank default risks.

Firms first choose how much to invest in information acquisition and then engage in dynamic price competition. In equilibrium firms acquire too little information from the perspective of industry profit and the perspective of social welfare. We consider two policies that an industry trade association may institute in light of this: (i) the trade association invests directly to acquire private information for each firm, and (ii) firms individually invest in acquiring private information on their costs, and the trade association collects this information and disseminates it after first period prices have been set. Allowing the trade association to acquire information increases firms' profits and may also increase consumer surplus. Information sharing eliminates firms' signaling incentives, and as a result leads to more information acquisition by the firms and higher consumer surplus as well as higher social welfare. However, information sharing increases firms' profits only when the ex ante uncertainty about cost is large, and it reduces profits otherwise. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the equilibrium network structure is very unequal in terms of links and access to jobs. The equilibrium network is not socially optimal because workers impose negative externality on each other by forming more links. The degree of inequality is larger in the equilibrium than what would be socially optimal. In the equilibrium, high-skilled individuals overinvest in networking while low-skilled individuals underinvest, which enlarges the impact of differences in interpersonal skills. The degree of inequality is largest when job availability is moderate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The EMD algorithm is used to decompose the carbon price into simple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue, which are identified as the components of high frequency, low frequency and trend by using the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to forecast the high frequency IMFs with ARCH effects. The LSSVM model with kernel function prototype is employed to forecast the high frequency IMFs without ARCH effects, the low frequency and trend components. The forecasting values of all the components are aggregated into the ones of original carbon price by the LSSVM with kernel function prototype-based nonlinear ensemble approach. Furthermore, particle swarm optimization is used for model selections of the LSSVM with kernel function prototype. Taking the popular prediction methods as benchmarks, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can achieve higher level and directional predictions and higher robustness. The findings show that the proposed model seems an advanced approach for predicting the high nonstationary, nonlinear and irregular carbon price. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Regarding the productivity growth gap, the metafrontier productivity growth gap and efficiency change gap appeared to show gradual convergences, but the technological change gap maintained the width at a certain extent.","[Zhu, Ning] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, 382 Outer Ring East Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ning; Wang, Bing] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, 601 West Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania",South China University of Technology; Jinan University; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Zhang, N (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, 601 West Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zn928zn@hotmail.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; Zhang, Ning/0000-0002-5634-4203","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703040]; Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education of China [17YJC790215, 17JZD013]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017BQ010]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province [GD15XYJ19]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71703040), the Humanities and Social Research Project of Ministry of Education of China (17YJC790215, 17JZD013), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017BQ010), and the Philosophy and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province (GD15XYJ19).",,35,4,4,1,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We study this question in a new model of matching under search frictions, which we estimate using data from an existing speed dating experiment.

These results are supported by a direct measure of subjective attraction. We also simulate the estimated model, and it predicts rejection patterns, matching rates, and sorting outcomes that fit the data very well. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that people in a dating environment act strategically and have at least an implicit under standing of the nature of the frictions and of the strategic equilibrium.

To investigate the mechanism, this paper has employed Ho & Zhu (2004) two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to decompose banks' efficiency into operational efficiency (ability to expand their business with given inputs), and market efficiency (ability to make maximum profits with given business scale), and test the impacts of foreign capital participation on sixteen Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency. The Tobit regression method has been employed since the market efficiency measured with the two-stage DEA approach is always positive and hence not random. The findings indicate that the foreign capital participation has significant and positive impact on the Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency even as a minority shareholder, while the weight of the foreign ownership is not so important. Besides, the banks are all significantly influenced by macroeconomic fluctuations. These findings are important for both China and the other transitional economies and developing economies to improve the policies of financial liberalisation.","[Xu, Tao] Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Tao] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA",Soochow University - China; University of Notre Dame,"Xu, T (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Xu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA.",tylersu@sina.com,,,Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790071]; Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program,"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program",The author is grateful for the sponsorship of the Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of China (Fund No.: 15YJA790071) and the Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program.,,35,1,1,3,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We show that if firm risk is ambiguous, while stocks always induce the agent to perceive a high risk, options can induce him to perceive a low risk. As a result, options can be less costly in incentivizing the agent than stocks in the presence of ambiguity. In addition, we show that providing the agent with more incentives would induce the agent to perceive a higher risk, and there is a discontinuous jump in the compensation cost as incentives increase, which makes the principal reluctant to reset contracts frequently when underlying fundamentals change. Thus, compensation contracts exhibit an inertia property. Lastly, the model sheds some light on the use of relative performance evaluation and provides a rationale for the puzzle of pay-for-luck in the presence of ambiguity.","[Liu, Qi] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lei] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Sun, Bo] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Peking University; University of Manitoba; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiliu@gsm.pku.edu.cn; Lei.Lu@umanitoba.ca; bo.sun@frb.gov,"Lu, Lei/GLS-7419-2022",,,,,,48,4,4,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We notice that in the frequency domain, the two variables have a relationship in higher spectrums (short-term). The results also show that co-movements exist during structural reforms and financial crises, which in turn supports the expenditure-switching model. The C.P.I. and P.P.I. are sensitive to variations in exchange rates, which pass through prices at the domestic level. Exchange rate shocks lead to inflationary pressure; therefore, long-term oriented intervention policies of the central banks will be more efficient.

Utilizing a support vector machine coupled with a fast messy genetic algorithm, this study developed two inference models, both using the same input variables: i.e., 18 building characteristics selected based on expert opinion. The first model was designed to judge whether a building needs to be retrofitted; and the second, to estimate the cost of retrofitting buildings to specific levels. The study proposes a life-cycle seismic risk framework that takes into account projections of the seismic risk a given building will confront over the course of its entire existence, and thus helps determine the economically optimal level of retrofitting. The results of a case study indicate that the higher upfront cost of retrofitting that is required to reach higher seismic performance levels could, depending on the level of predicted seismic risk, be offset by lower repair costs in the long run. It is hoped that this research will serve as a basis for further studies of the assessment of the life-cycle seismic risk of school buildings, with the wider aim of arriving at an economically optimal building-retrofit policy.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Wu, Yu-Wei; Chen, Hung-Ming; Wu, Cai-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Ringgold Stand Inst, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Wei, Hsi-Hsien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Wei, HH (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hhwei@polyu.edu.hk,"Wei, Hsi Hsein/AAR-4108-2020; Cheng, Min-Yuan/G-3510-2013","Wei, Hsi-Hsien/0000-0002-7024-0726",,,,,27,3,3,1,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Regional financial center modernization, however, has been the predominant propulsion of economic sustainability. Decisions related to regional financial center modernization development are inherent problems of multiple attribute decision-making (MADM), and strategically important to the government. The purpose of this paper is to set up a regional financial center improvement model for modernization development, as based on a hybrid MADM model, which addresses the main causal-effect factors and amended priorities in order to strengthen ongoing planning. This paper adopts a new hybrid MADM model combined with the DEMATEL technique to construct an influential network relationship map (INRM) and determined the influential weights of DANP. Then, a modified VIKOR method using influential weights is applied to measure and integrate the performance gaps from each criterion into dimensions, as well as the overall criterion for evaluating and improving the modernization development of the regional financial center, as based on INRM. Finally an empirical case study using data from the Guangzhou regional financial center is carried out as an example to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed hybrid MADM model for solving real-world problems. The results show the priorities for improvement, as based on the degree of the effect and impact of the dimensions, as follows: first is making government policy, second is enforcing financial infrastructure and safety, next is formulating financial institutions and human resources, and finally financial service.","[Hu, Kuang-Hua] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, 21 Chisha Rd, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei Jianguo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei Jianguo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Accounting Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Publ Affairs, Grad Inst Urban Planning, New Taipei, Taiwan","Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Nanfang College, Guangzhou; National Taipei University","Hu, KH (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, 21 Chisha Rd, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",18320709916@163.com,,,,,,,90,17,17,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of tariff echoing - after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001-2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A questionnaire with a multiple-bounded discrete choice format was designed and 555 valid samples were gathered in this analysis. On average, companies are willing to pay 8.3% more on energy costs, while those participating in pilot trading schemes are willing to pay 10.2% more. Pilot companies also have higher investment in energy-saving technology, better awareness of both carbon mitigation technology and carbon policy, and clearer expectations of the national carbon market. The regression analysis shows that the willingness to pay (WTP) is influenced by several factors. The perception of the high pressure of energy costs will significantly decrease the WTP of the non-pilot companies. If a pilot company presumes that it will participate in the national trading schemes sooner, its willingness to pay will be higher. Participation or not in pilot trading schemes exerts an effect on companies' WTP because of two factors: awareness of carbon mitigation technology and the reduction ratio expected by the companies. Among all manufacturing sectors, companies involved in the non-ferrous, chemical, paper-making and iron and steel sectors can be brought into the national carbon market as priority participants, because they have a higher WTP for carbon emissions, or they have a shorter time expectation for participating in the national carbon market.

Consumers engage in costly search to find out whether products meet their needs. Consumer search is directed by prices when they are observable before search, in contrast to the case in which prices are discovered only after search, where search is naturally random. The equilibrium under price-directed search differs substantially from that under random search, despite certain similarities. We show that as search costs decrease, sales become more likely and firms earn higher expected profits under price-directed search, whereas the opposite holds under random search. Moreover, compared with random search, under price-directed search firms, expected profits are always lower, but consumer surplus and total welfare are higher provided that the search cost is sufficiently small.

This paper, considers selecting a more suitable valuation model to measure the intrinsic value and price bubble of Internet-based Finance stocks. By comparing the relative valuation accuracy of the Kim et al. model with the Frankel-Lee model and the F-O model applied in the prior studies, this study finds that the Kim et al. model highlights the industry-specific features and outperforms other models in interpreting stocks price variation. Especially, under the circumstance of soaring and slumping stocks price variation (e.g. 2015), it is essential to study the price bubbles of internetbased finance stocks at different points of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index. Surprisingly, our empirical results suggest that the internet-based finance stocks have negative bubbles at the whole average level, and about half of them are undervalued. Moreover, there are positive correlations between the bubble level and three key factors including the trading volume, the price to book ratio and whether to do cross-industry business on internet-based finance. These findings imply that the Kim et al. model contributes to improving valuation accuracy of internet-based finance stocks and explainability of the price bubbles in A-share market.","[Zhao, Yi] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Baiqing] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Binqing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Fu] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Nanjing University; Northeastern University - China,"Xiao, BQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Bengking@nju.edu.cn,,"Xiao, Binqing/0000-0002-3319-7175; Cheng, Fu/0000-0003-1039-6646","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71774042,71532004,71671083,71271109]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFB1401801]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N160603001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 71774042,71532004,71671083,71271109), National Key Research and Development Plan in 2017 (Grant No. 2017YFB1401801) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. N160603001).",,36,3,3,7,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Consistent with the findings of a large empirical literature, we find that parental migration has a significantly negative impact on left-behind children's educational outcomes as measured by test scores in Chinese and math. But unlike much of the existing studies on the subject, we focus on the remediation effect of return migrant parents on once left-behind children's performance. This empirical strategy allows us to avoid the endogeneity issue concerning the migration decision that may have contaminated previous studies. We find evidence that return migrant parents help alleviate the harms caused by parental migration, and the remediation effect is stronger for children attending middle schools, and stronger for daughters. We also find suggestive evidence that return migrant parents improve children's performance through increases in after-school study time and education-related expenditures, following the return of migrant parents.","[Liu, Zhiqiang] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY USA; [Liu, Zhiqiang; Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiang] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Central University of Finance & Economics; Boston College,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zliu@buffalo.edu; liyu@cufe.edu.cn; zhengxr@bc.edu,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Yu, Li/0000-0003-0067-6548; Zheng, Xiang/0000-0002-1880-650X",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9154034]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403303]; Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan at Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP1604],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan at Central University of Finance and Economics,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Project No. 9154034), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71403303), Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan (Project No. QYP1604) at Central University of Finance and Economics.

We use the Chinese 2008 Labor Contract Law to identify the effects of employment protection on job-finding rates and subsequent job-match quality, in relation to the duration of workers' past unemployment. The causal effects are estimated in a sharp regression-discontinuity design, allowing for workers' unobserved characteristics to jointly underlie their sequential and multidimensional outcomes in labor markets. Even though the law protracts unemployment duration in the short run, once an individual succeeds in finding a job, it improves job-match quality including better job security, higher wages and higher likelihood of receiving social insurance. However, where there is equal unemployment duration, migrants have lower job-finding rates and worse job-match quality than locals. Men have lower job-finding rates but better job-match quality than women.

The authors exploit the flat-rate structure of China's corporate income tax, along with its system of targeted, preferential rates, to estimate the relationship between profits and tax rates. Their sample consists of approximately 60,000 observations of foreign-owned MNCs from the years 2005-2009. Using the traditional approach of regressing before-tax profits on tax rates, the authors find evidence consistent with profit-shifting. However, this approach is suspect because the nature of China's tax preferences makes it especially vulnerable to omitted variable bias. Accordingly, the authors employ finite mixture modelling to search for the existence of a group of profitshifting-MNCs. While their analysis identifies two types of firms, subsequent investigation failed to produce any evidence linking these to profit-shifting behavior. Robustness checks exploiting the panel nature of the dataset, along with further investigation of investmenttax elasticities, confirm the authors' null finding of profit-shifting. One reason for the lack of profit-shifting among Chinese MNCs may be that corporate tax rates were relatively low during this period.","[Qian, Xuefeng; Tian, Bifei; Chen, Ziruo] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Reed, W.

It is well known in the literature that in order for the RBC model to replicate quantitatively plausible empirical moments of small open economies, the model needs to feature counterfactually a small income effect on labor supply. This paper considers home production that introduces substitutability between market consumption and home consumption, which in turn generates a high volatility in market consumption in accordance with the data, even in the presence of a sizable income effect on labor supply. Furthermore, the model with estimated parameter values based on the simulated method of moments is able to match other empirical moments, such as the standard deviations of output, investment and the trade balance and the correlations between output and other macroeconomic variables. Given that home production is more prevalent in emerging markets than in developed economies, the model is able to replicate empirical differences between emerging markets and developed economies in the volatility of market consumption and the volatility/countercyclicality of the trade balance.

Evidence from Japan's Imports,CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,constant market share analysis (CMS); crowded out; crowding out; industrial relocation,,"Previous studies have investigated whether Chinese exports have crowded out those from other countries. However, what has yet to be considered is the evidence based on different quality varieties. Using the most detailed Harmonized System 9-digit product-level data, the present paper provides evidence of crowding-out and crowded-out effects across different product quality segments and across manufacturing sectors by quality segments. The empirical evidence presented in this paper shows that the crowding-out effects of Chinese exports have been greatest at the lower end of the quality spectrum but less significant at the higher quality spectrum. Moreover, since 2007, China's own exports of lower quality manufactured goods have been increasingly crowded out. The key policy implication is that China's export path is in line with that taken by other Asian economies in previous decades; the crowded-out effect could achieve win-win outcomes for countries involved; and lower income countries would do well to be open to receive those relocated low value-added industries from China. However, the relocation policy in China is best implemented gradually as climbing up the product quality ladder takes time.","[Liu, Yan] Dalian Minzu Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng; Laurenceson, James] Univ Technol Sydney, Australian China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Dalian Minzu University; University of Technology Sydney,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Australian China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lhyddhmt@163.com; xunpeng.shi@gmail.com; James.Laurenceson@uts.edu.au,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395; Laurenceson, James/0000-0002-3991-0082",National Social Science Fund of China [13CGJ034],National Social Science Fund of China,Yan Liu acknowledges financial support from the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 13CGJ034; Project title Research on the Chinese Manufacturing Export Quality).,,23,18,23,7,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2018,26,4,,,,,1,23,,10.1111/cwe.12246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cwe.12246,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN3GV,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024/3/8,WOS:000438893100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Following Ni and Wang (2007) and Dong et al. (2012), we first show that the Upstream Equal Sharing method and the Downstream Equal Sharing method coincide with the conjunctive permission value (van den Brink and Gilles, 1996) of an associated game with a permission structure, which is obtained as the Shapley value of an associated restricted game. Two main advantages of this approach are (i) we obtain new axiomatizations of the two sharing methods based on axiomatizations of the conjunctive permission value, and (ii) by applying the alternative disjunctive permission value, obtained as the Shapley value of a different restricted game, we propose the new Upstream Limited Sharing method and provide an axiomatization.

Assuming firms with relatively advanced technology adopt sophisticated Cournot strategy while the remaining with backward technology behave as price takers, we find that an increase in technological gap between two types of firms may paradoxically lead to higher profits for not only the advanced but also the backward. Moreover, wider technological distance could lead to lower market concentration and be welfare enhancing. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Though the effects of positive and negative reviews to consumers' purchase decisions have been analyzed, they were examined statically and separately. In reality, online review community allows everyone to express and receive opinions and individuals can reexamine their opinions after receiving messages from others. The goal of this paper is to study how potential customers form their opinions dynamically under the effects of both positive and negative reviews using a numerical simulation. The results show that consumers with different membership levels have different information sensitivities to online reviews. Consumers at low and medium membership levels are often persuaded by online reviews, regardless of their initial opinion about a product. On the other hand, online reviews have less effect on consumers at higher membership levels, who often make purchase decisions based on their initial impressions of a product.","[Chen, Jia; Peng, Yi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Kou, Gang] Southwest Univ Finance & Econ China, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Peng, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",pengyi@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,57,12,12,8,49,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In the last six rounds, subjects in all treatments made decisions on an identical set of lotteries. We found that subjects who had experienced a riskier environment exhibited a higher degree of risk aversion.

Moreover, empirical results show that the impact factors are different between developing and developed countries, especially the design characteristics. Specifically, for developing countries, the scheme with the Foreign currency will support a higher coverage. And for developed countries, the Interbank deposits will lead to a lower coverage, but the No coinsurance shows the opposite effect. It is noteworthy that both the Payouts and Backstop from government influence the coverage setting conversely in different samples, which implies that there may be higher banks' risk-taking incentives in developing countries after setting up explicit deposit insurance system.","[Chang, Yiming; Zhao, Shangmei; Yang, Haijun; He, Jiang; Hu, Fei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shangmei; Yang, Haijun] Beihang Univ, Inst Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haijun] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University; Beihang University,"Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Inst Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data & Brain Comp, Beijing, Peoples R China.",changyiming@buaa.edu.cn; beihangzsm@163.com; navy@buaa.edu.cn; hejiang686@163.com; hufeijr@sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771006, 71373017]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors appreciate the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71771006 and 71373017.,,26,4,4,4,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

After firms completed the reform, their float increased by 31% on average, while turnover and trading volume also increased substantially. We use information from firms' reform plan to derive an estimate of the price premium of tradable shares over non-tradable shares before the reform and find that, after controlling for differences in liquidity and profitability, the price premium is significantly related to proxies for the level of speculative trading in tradable shares. Moreover, firms that were highly speculated before the reform had significantly smaller increase in turnover and trading volume than firms that were less speculated. Overall, our evidence confirms that there is a significant speculative component in the market price of tradable shares in China and a large increase in float dampens speculative trading.","[Hwang, Chuan-Yang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, S3-01B-46 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zhang, Shaojun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yanjian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Zhejiang University,"Zhu, YJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",cyhwang@ntu.edu.sg; afszhang@inet.polyu.edu.hk; zhuyanjian@zju.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Shaojun/0000-0001-6138-0308",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ13G030002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403238]; Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [G-YM74],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"Yanjian Zhu would like to thank the financial supports by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LQ13G030002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403238), and the Zhijiang Youth of Social Science Scholar Supporting Project.

None have done so more eagerly than Ethiopia. The present paper draws on Justin Yifu Lin's framework of New Structural Economics to assess Ethiopia's industrial policies and engagement in the leather industry. Making use of two rounds of semi-structured interviews (2012 and 2015) with all of the foreign firms and more than a dozen local firms in the leather sector, as well as other key stakeholders, it examines seven steps the government took to build the industrial policy: Create a high-level focus on the sector; make strategic use of international development partners; attract a lead goose (Chinese) in the footwear sector; build government capacity to support the sector; strengthen business associations; shock-to-shape upgrading; improve input supply. Ultimately, while government interventions have led to improvements across several steps of the value chain, the paper identifies a number of factors that have prevented the country from fully realizing a latent comparative advantage in the leather sector.

We propose an analytical framework that encompasses several models of search for differentiated products, with a high-quality firm being more likely to offer a product that meets each consumer's need. An intermediary improves consumer search efficiency by providing a search platform on which positions are sold to high-quality firms through competitive bidding. While the intermediary may admit too many or too few firms to its platform, compared to what would maximize consumer surplus or total welfare, its presence can nevertheless benefit consumers and improve welfare. However, the intermediary may reduce search efficiency when firms are differentiated only horizontally, when they sell experience or credence goods, or when the intermediary is biased (possibly due to vertical integration).

A local leader makes policies primarily to secure his political survival, which is contingent on the support from either his higher-level patrons or his local grassroots constituents. Using a simple model, we show that a local politician with close factional ties to high-level patrons will invest more in sending loyalty signals to the latter to receive their protections, while a poorly-connected politician will make more effort to spur a broad-based economic growth that economically benefits his local constituents. Using a unique county level data on the factional politics of Zhejiang Province, China, we find that counties with weaker (closer) factional ties have lower (higher) tax burdens per capita, while spending more (less) on local public goods provision.

These outcomes are compared to those which result from the behavior of selfish agents. A variant of Fehr-Schmidt preferences is employed that allows the externality from agents who are ahead to differ in magnitude from the externality from those who are behind in the income distribution. We find first, that inequality-averse preferences yield distributional outcomes that are analogous to tax-transfer schemes with selfish agents, and may either increase or decrease average consumption. Second, in a society of inequality-averse agents, a linear income tax can be welfare-enhancing. Third, inequality-averse preferences can lead to less redistribution at any given tax, with low-wage agents receiving smaller net subsidies and/or high-wage individuals paying less in net taxes. Finally, an inequality-averse median voter may prefer higher redistribution even if it means less utility from own consumption and leisure.","[Murray, Matthew N.; Santore, Rudy] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 505A, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Peng, Langchuan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nanjing Audit University,"Peng, LC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",mmurray1@utk.edu; langchaun-peng@126.com; rsantore@utk.edu,,"Peng, Langchuan/0000-0001-9253-2378",,,,,30,0,0,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

To investigate the distributive properties of monetary policy the authors resort to an agent-based macroeconomic model where firms, households and one bank interact on the basis of limited information and adaptive rules-of-thumb. Simulations show that the model can replicate fairly well a number of stylized facts, especially those relative to the business cycle. The authors address the issue using three types of computational experiments, including a global sensitivity analysis carried out through a novel methodology which greatly reduces the computational burden of simulations. The result emerges that a more restrictive monetary policy increases inequality, even though this effect may differ across groups of households. In addition, it appears to be attenuated if the bank's willingness to lend is lower. The overall analysis suggests that inequality can constitute valuable information also for central banks.","[Chen, Siyan; Desiderio, Saul] Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shantou University,"Desiderio, S (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",saul@stu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310148],Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, under Grant No. 2018A030310148.

Evidence from a multiple bubble test,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hub pricing; Bubbles; Natural gas; Oil indexation,CRUDE-OIL; MARKET FUNDAMENTALS; PRICES; ENERGY; STOCK; FINANCIALIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FUTURES; IMPACT; SHOCKS,"Oil indexation and hub-based pricing are two competing pricing mechanisms in the international natural gas markets. The debates over whether hub-based pricing is preferable to oil indexation have become intense among academics and practitioners, for example, whether and when East Asia should adopt hub pricing. This paper contributes empirically to the debate using a multiple bubble test. Adopting the generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller test proposed by Phillips et al. (2015), we show that more explosive bubbles exist in Japan and European gas prices than in the US prices. The argument is that hub-based pricing mechanism can better reflect fundamental values in the gas markets and thus is less subject to speculations. Given the recent trend of financialization in energy markets, gas prices are more likely to deviate from fundamental values when they are not clear to investors. Although oil indexation is simple and has been an effective tool over the past few decades, our results suggest that hub pricing is associated with less extreme price movements in the market and thus is a better choice for both policy makers and practitioners.

The diversified and changing nature of works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify changes, and map out KM research framework for future exploration. The study involves three aspects. First, three stages of KM research in construction were distinguished in terms of the time distribution of 217 target publications. Major topics in the stages were extracted for understanding the changes of research emphasis from evolutionary perspective. Second, the past works were summed up in a three-dimensional research framework in terms of management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective. Finally, potential research orientations in the future were predicted to expand the existing research framework. It was found that (1) KM research has significantly blossomed in the last two decades with a great potential; (2) major topics of KM were changing in terms of technology, technique, organization, attribute of knowledge, and research objectives; (3) past KM studies centred around management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective, thus a three-dimensional research framework was proposed; (4) within the research framework, team-level, project-level, and firm-level KM were studied to achieve project, organizational, and competitive objectives by integrated methodologies of information technology, social technique, and KM process tool; and (5) nine potential research orientations were predicted corresponding to the three dimensions. Finally, an expanded research framework was proposed to encourage and guide future research works in this field. The paper only focused on the construction industry. The findings need further exploration in order to discover any possible missing important research works which were not published in English or not included in the time period. The paper formed a systematic framework of KM research in construction and predicted the potential research orientations. It provides much value for the researchers who want to understand the past and the future of global KM research in the construction industry.","[Yu, Dengke] Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jay] Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Nanchang University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Yu, DK (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yudengke@ncu.edu.cn; j.yang@qut.edu.au,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201072, 71563027]; China Scholarship Council",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71201072 and 71563027).

While these suggestions have strong advantages, they also potentially increase the financial costs associated with data collection and, as a result, hamper the growth of experimental economics and limit the questions that may be addressed using experimental methods. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of extra credit as a reward medium as it is financially less taxing and readily available to most researchers as an alternative. We focus on experimental asset markets because data is particularly costly to collect for these experiments, e.g., a market consisting of 8-12 traders interacting over 15 trading periods is an independent observation. Our treatment variable is the reward medium, either extra credit or cash. We compare bubble measures in the two treatments and we find that bubbles observed in the extra-credit sessions are not significantly different from bubbles observed in the cash sessions. These results suggest that extra credit is an effective reward medium in experimental asset markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Income polarization can be closely linked to social exclusion, which is relevant for EU social policy, because combatting social exclusion is a central element of the Lisbon Agenda and the Europe 2020 Strategy. Rising income polarization has been observed outside Europe, but within the EU, polarization is relatively unexplored. This paper provides theoretical insights into this relatively new dimension of income distribution and analyzes trends in income polarization in 28 EU countries and 3 non-EU countries, using micro-data from EU-SILC over the period 2004-2012. Income polarization is rather stable over this period in European countries, and Europe-wide. It was rising among the old EU15 countries in the sub-period 2004-2008, but declining afterwards. The opposite development is witnessed for New Member States. Despite the Great Recession we find quite stable income polarization in Europe.","[Wang, Jinxian; Caminada, Koen; Goudswaard, Kees] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,Chinese Scholarship Council; Natural Science Foundation of China [71703088]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591645]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC045],Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"Leiden University, Leiden University, Leiden University, and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, respectively.

First, majority rule is more vulnerable than super-majority rules to the disproportionate influence of impatient committee members. Second, more diverse preferences, more patient members, or more unanimous decision voting rules lead to lengthier deliberation and more accurate decisions.

We build a fully-fledged heterogeneous-agent model with an endogenous financial market of private credit and debt to rationalize these stylized facts. We show how financial development that promotes better credit allocations under more relaxed borrowing constraints can reduce the impact of non-financial shocks (such as TFP shocks, government spending shocks, preference shocks) on aggregate output and investment, and why this volatility-reducing effect diminishes with continuing financial liberalizations.

The empirical evidence shows that the amount of punctuation is negatively associated with the funding probability and borrowing rate. We propose that the usage of punctuation affects the readability of a loan description and reflects borrowers' self-control and cognitive ability. Within a given number of words, excessive usage of punctuation makes loan description informal and reduces the readability of the text, thereby impairing investors' trust in borrowers. Moreover, borrowers that overuse punctuation may have lower ability of self-control, and tend to underestimate the risk of borrowing and offer lower borrowing rate due to overconfidence.","[Chen, Xiao] Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bihong] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Ye, Dezhu] Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Ye, DZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenxiao427@163.com; bihuang@adbi.org; gzydz@126.com,,"chen, xiao/0000-0001-8308-8973; Huang, Bihong/0000-0001-6492-9845; Ye, Dezhu/0009-0007-3128-149X",,,,,45,57,59,7,68,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We develop a model that endogenizes these differences and examines their economic consequences. A crucial determinant of differences in overconfidence is the degree of expected stability of the environment, with greater changefulness giving rise to more overconfident beliefs. When stability is endogenized, multiple equilibria can emerge, dynamism and overconfidence reinforcing each other in one case, stability and realistic self-assessment in another. Evidence from 38 countries is consistent with this relationship. Our model also sheds light on differences in overconfidence across individuals. We conduct a large-scale survey in China and find evidence consistent with the model's cross-sectional implications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a minimum distance strategy, we find that international financial risk sharing is low even for advanced small open economies. Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents. However, vacancies and unemployment hardly respond whenever the real exchange rate channel is mute. These findings suggest the relevance of the open economy dimension for the transmission of demand type shocks to the labour market more generally.

In particular, the authors consider such conditions where the financial markets are imperfect and suffer from various frictions that the commercial bank cannot readily modulate their liquidity and capital buffers, especially at an aggregate level or within a short period. Meanwhile, as a result of maturity mismatch and fundamental uncertainty, the credit and money creation activities inevitably add to the liquidity and insolvency risks faced by the bank. Under the assumptions that the levels of bank reserves, capital and government bonds are exogenously given, and that the concerned prudential regulations are always binding, the authors examine the determinants of the broad money aggregate and the money multiplier. Specifically, they find that 1) the money multiplier under Basel III is not constant but a decreasing function of the monetary base; 2) the determinants of the bank's money creation capacity are regulation specific; 3) when multiple regulations are imposed simultaneously, the effective binding regulation and the corresponding money multiplier will vary across different economic states and bank balance sheet conditions.","[Xiong, Wanting; Wang, Yougui] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Wang, YG (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ygwang@bnu.edu.cn,"Xiong, Wan-Ting/GQR-1764-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773069]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015KJJCA06],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773069) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2015KJJCA06).

Our simulations indicate that in 2011, had the share of trade by the sourcing economy remained at the level of 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008 whereas the global final demand remained the same, global CO2 emissions in production processes would have been 2.8 Gt, 2.0 Gt, 13 Gt, and 540 Mt., respectively, lower than the actual emissions. As there is a general outsourcing trend shifted from developed economies to developing economies, the overall direct emission costs have always been significantly positive. Further investigations by economy and industry show that such a geographic shift was mainly dominated by developed economies themselves and occurred in high-tech industries, such as production of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) goods and machinery, leading to positive emission cost in developing economies, especially China. Moreover, there is potentially even larger influence of geographic shift of sourcing on global CO2 emissions, as such a shift would stimulate the economic growth and consumptions in developing economies, consequently this may bring additional energy demand and CO2 emissions. Our results addressed the urgency of eliminating in carbon emission intensity gap between developing and developed economies and the successful development of new, scalable low carbon energy sourcing and technologies across the world.

The stock returns of the coal, chemical, mining and oil industries are found to be positively affected by crude oil price movements. Conversely, electronics, food manufacturing, general equipment, pharmaceuticals, retail, rubber and vehicle industries are found to be negatively affected by movements in the price of crude oil.

In this paper the idea of mixed data sampling (MIDAS) is extended from linear correlation in Colacito et al. (2011) to the more general dependence measure: copula, and a copula-MIDAS model is proposed to describe the asymmetric return-liquidity dependence of CSI 300 index futures with short-run and long-run components. Based on the skewed t copula-MIDAS model, it is found that extreme decreases in returns tend to be accompanied by extreme increases in bid-ask spreads, but extreme increases in returns may not coincide with extreme reductions in bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, the return-spread dependence consists of both short-run and long-run components, and the long-run component will influence the return-spread dependence in the next two weeks. Last, the out-of-sample forecast of liquidity risk stresses the importance of considering asymmetry and long-run trend in return-spread dependence as it enables investors to well predict liquidity risk in times of market crashes. The results imply that high frequency trading investors of CSI 300 index futures should pay more attentions to prevent the potential liquidity risk when the bid-ask spreads are widened. And investors are suggested to use the past two-week high frequency data to forecast the current return-spread dependence in liquidity risk management.","[Gong, Yuting] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Room 511,Wenhui Bldg,20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jufang] Hunan Univ, Sch Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Hunan University,"Gong, YT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Room 511,Wenhui Bldg,20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China.",yutinggongl1@.shu.edu.cn,,"Liang, Jufang/0000-0003-0917-8799",Chinese National Science Foundation [71601108],Chinese National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank the editors and three anonymous referees for many helpful comments that helped in improving the quality of the paper.

To examine the role of offshoring and technological change in driving this labor market development, we develop a task-based model of production in global value chains and propose a decomposition of changes in occupational labor demand. In the setup of the model, technological change affects the total number of workers with a certain occupation throughout the production chain, while task relocation consists of a shift in occupational labor demand from one location to another. For the empirical implementation we combine harmonized cross-country occupations data with world input-output tables. The results of our decomposition suggest that technological change increased the number of non-routine relative to routine occupations in all countries. The effect of task relocation is less strong, and works in the same direction for advanced countries such as Germany and the United States but in the opposite direction for emerging countries such as China and Poland.","[Reijnders, Laurie S.

A theory is formulated and tested using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data.

Results indicate higher linear stock return predictability for the Hong Kong market than for the Chinese markets. However, the results differ when model instability is considered. Specifically, using Bai and Perron's (1998, 2003) approach, the results indicate the presence of structural breaks particularly for the Shenzhen market, which appear to coincide with major economic events or political and institutional changes. The predictable component in stock returns is also time-varying when re-estimating the model over different subsamples defined by the break. Overall, results highlight the importance of considering breaks in forecasting stock returns, and suggest that the Hong Kong market is a relatively ideal haven to park wealth for risk-averse investors whereas the Shenzhen market offers enhanced opportunities for risk-seeking investors.

When bidders are ex ante homogeneous, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium, but asymmetric equilibria may also exist. We provide conditions under which the equilibrium is unique (not only among symmetric ones).

This article captures the impact of capacity constraints on quality and quantity competition of restaurant industry by employing a two-stage asymmetric capacity constraints model. There are several findings from this study. First, results of this study indicate that reputation difference increases total outputs and quality in equilibrium. Second, capacity constraints decrease the consumer surplus (CS) as well as social welfare (SW), but restaurants benefit from capacity constraints sometimes. Third, capacity reduces both the quality and quantity of the competitor. Furthermore, restaurants raise their prices if consumers are quality-sensitive or lower the quality if consumers are price-sensitive under capacity constraints. Fourth, this study compares the total quality, CS, and SW under four cases: no restaurant faces constraints, small restaurant faces constraints, big restaurant faces constraints, and both small and big restaurants face constraints. The total quality investment, CS, and SW are highest if a small restaurant faces capacity constraints while the larger one does not.","[Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA",South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",heqy83@scau.edu.cn,"; Chen, You-hua/M-4136-2013","He, Qinying/0000-0003-1234-5690; Chen, You-hua/0000-0001-5697-9295","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71401057, 71771057, 71573092]; Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD13YLJ02]; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province [2014A070704008]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]; key National Social Science Fund of PRC [14AJY020]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633002, 71333004]","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province; key National Social Science Fund of PRC; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work is partially supported by Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS (2012) and National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (71401057, 71771057, 71573092), Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD13YLJ02), The Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province (2014A070704008), Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & Industry, and Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province (2015WCXTD009), the key National Social Science Fund of PRC (14AJY020), and the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71633002; 71333004).",,38,13,14,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses revisions in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country's interest rate if it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest rates are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and document patterns of 2.5-lemma or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, in order to combine the advantages of the MSM and interaction operational rules of IFSs, we propose the intuitionistic fuzzy interaction Maclaurin symmetric mean (IFIMSM) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted interaction Maclaurin symmetric mean (IFWIMSM) operator, respectively. Furthermore, we research some desirable properties and some special cases of them. Further, we develop a new method to deal with some multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment based on these operators.

The adopted methodology allows us to identify causal networks based on the measurements of observed correlations and partial correlations, without relying on a priori assumptions. Results from the contemporaneous analysis indicate that the Bitcoin market is quite isolated, and no specific asset plays a dominant role in influencing the Bitcoin market. However, we find evidence of lagged relationships between Bitcoin and some assets, especially during the bear market state of Bitcoin. This finding suggests that the integration between the Bitcoin and other financial assets is a continuous process that varies over time. We conduct forecast error variance decompositions and find that the influence of each of the other assets on Bitcoin over a 20-day horizon does not account for more than 11% of all innovations.

This paper explains the relationship between this dual limit theory by showing how the asymptotic forms are linked in terms of joint and sequential limits. In one case, joint asymptotics apply when both the sample size diverges and the threshold effect shrinks to zero, whereas sequential asymptotics operate in the other case in which the sample size diverges first and the threshold effect shrinks subsequently. The two operations lead to the same limit distribution, thereby linking the two different cases. The proofs make use of ideas involving limit theory for sums of a random number of summands.

In our experiment, we first increase the number of students per match from 4 to 40; when we do so, participant truth-telling increases under DA but decreases under IA, leading to a decrease in efficiency under both mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that DA remains more stable than IA, regardless of scale. We then further increase the number of participants per match to 4,000 through the introduction of robots. When robots report their preferences truthfully, we find that scale has no effect on human best response behavior. By contrast, when we program the robots to draw their strategies from the distribution of empirical human strategies, we find that our increase in scale increases human ex-post best responses under both mechanisms.

However, high investment costs and risk hinder the diffusion of CCS. To avoid stranded assets or high future costs for retrofitting, new plants can be made carbon capture ready (CCR) to enable them to accommodate future CCS retrofitting at low additional costs. Current CCR investment decisions are closely related to future CCS retrofitting and CCS operation decisions in subsequent stages, all of which would be affected by uncertainties. We develop a three-stage CCR investment decision model under multiple uncertainties which allows for investment and especially operating flexibilities. Applying this model to China shows that CCS operating flexibility under the carbon-pricing scheme may actually lower the probability of investing in a CCR plant, and neglecting it may overestimate the propensity for investing in CCR. Moreover, learning effects, which reduce the costs of future CCS retrofitting, may be detrimental to CCR investment, indicating that the policy support for research on, development of, and deployment of CCS to reduce CCS costs should be coordinated with CCR investments. Although higher electricity prices can increase the value of an investment opportunity, it may restrain CCR investment. Finally, CCR investment does not appear to be economically viable under current conditions in China because of low carbon prices, high carbon price risks, high CCR investment costs and the high opportunity costs of CCS operation.

We show that perception bias affects charitable giving through its effects on warm glow, while inequality aversion counteracts these effects. Donors' perception bias regarding a recipient's situation does not necessarily decrease their charitable giving. Specifically, perception bias regarding the recipients' effort and life shock decreases donors' charitable giving. Perception bias regarding the recipients' ability decreases donors' giving to charities designed to help low-ability recipients but increases their giving to charities designed to help high-ability recipients. We also show that perception bias increases with donors' income. Fundraising professionals shall allocate more efforts to those who do not care about inequality that much when correcting the donors' perception bias; focus their efforts on correcting the donors' perception bias, especially for rich donors, when raising money for charities with low-ability recipients; but increase donors' perception bias regarding the recipients' ability when raising money for charities with high-ability recipients.","[Su, Kun] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wan, Rui] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing University,"Wan, R (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sukun@nwpu.edu.cn; wanrui@nju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402141, 71773088]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M582705, 2016T90943, 2016M600389]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in Northwestern Polytechnical University [3102017jc19005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in Northwestern Polytechnical University,"The authors are grateful to Jingping Li for constructive suggestions.

However, there is an absence of research dealing with the relationship between IPR protection and the international competitiveness of high-tech industries, especially the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This study aims to examine the impact of the strength of IPR protection on the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, by using time series data from 1995 to 2014. A modified Ginarte-Park (GP) index is used to measure the strength of IPR protection, while the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index is used to measure the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. A multivariate time series model and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation are employed to examine the relationship between IPR protection and the RCA index. The results show that strict IPR protection does not enhance the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The finding suggests that it is more appropriate to adopt a more relaxed IPR protection system for the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China. The finding may also provide a reference for countries which have similar backgrounds.","[Cai, Jiaoli; Zhao, Hongzhong] Wuhan Univ Technol, 122 Luoshi Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cai, Jiaoli; Coyte, Peter C.] Univ Toronto, 155 Coll St,Suite 425, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada",Wuhan University of Technology; University of Toronto,"Cai, JL (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, 122 Luoshi Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Cai, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 155 Coll St,Suite 425, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada.",jiaoli.cai@mail.utoronto.ca; zhaohz@mail.whut.edu.cn; peter.coyte@utoronto.ca,"Cai, Lucy/HKF-0013-2023",,,,,,52,6,8,2,58,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A characteristic of China's export trade is its strong dependence on assembly and processing activities. To take proper account of this, China's VS shares should explicitly distinguish processing export production from other production. We estimate China's annual VS shares from 2000 to 2012the latest year for which a special input-output table is available that makes such an explicit distinction. We find that VS shares increased from 2000 to 2004 and subsequently started to decrease. To explore why it has declined, we introduce a new structural decomposition approach. We find that the decrease of the VS share appears to have been driven mainly by the substitution of imported intermediates by domestic products. This occurred in particular in the production of exports, which implies an upgrading of China's position in global value chains.","[Duan, Yuwan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jiang, Xuemei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xikang; Yang, Cuihong] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xikang; Yang, Cuihong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Groningen; Capital University of Economics & Business; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Duan, YW (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",duanyuwan@126.com,"Duan, Yuwan/AAP-3781-2020; Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021","Jiang, Xuemei/0000-0002-5639-0453; Duan, Yuwan/0000-0002-0557-7525; Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473244, 71673269, 71704195]; Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China [2017000026833ZS01]; Beijing Social Science Fund of China [16YJC068]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China; Beijing Social Science Fund of China,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473244,71673269, 71704195]; Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China [2017000026833ZS01]; Beijing Social Science Fund of China [16YJC068].",,43,19,21,5,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

However, how did market evolve? Previous research has explored the impacts of spatial distance and transportation conditions on market integration. This article argues that natural disasters also played a crucial role in the evolution of market integration in China, particularly in the grain market. When natural disasters occur, governments' relief measures and merchants' arbitrage activities will gradually promote interconnectivity among local grain markets. In this article, China's major grain monthly price data set from 1746 to 1795 and the Chinese historical disaster records dataset from 1696 to 1795 are used to analyse the impact of natural disasters on grain market integration. The empirical results show that natural disasters have a significantly positive effect on the integration of the grain market. The findings continue to hold after controlling the traffic conditions, grain varieties and lag effect. This study proposes a new perspective for understanding the evolution of the grain market.","[Li, Yao; Ruan, Jianqing; Ye, Chunhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Ruan, JQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",ruanjq@126.com,,"Ruan, Jianqing/0000-0002-4440-589X",,,,,23,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Subsequently, using the consolidated framework of collusive practices, a questionnaire was further developed and disseminated, which received 97 valid replies. The questionnaire data were then utilized to develop and validate the collusion risk assessment model with the facilitation of artificial neural network approach. The developed model was finally applied in a real-life metro project in which its reliability and applicability were both verified. Although the model was developed under the context of Chinese construction projects, its developing strategy can be applied in other countries, especially for those emerging economies that have a significant concern of collusion in their construction sectors, and thus contributing to the global body of knowledge of collusion.","[Shan, Ming] Cent S Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Le, Yun; Hu, Yi] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yiu, Kenneth T.

However, the mechanisms of how energy-related emissions are driven by inter-sectoral linkages remains unexplored. In this paper, a subsystem input-output model was developed to investigate the temporal and sectoral changes of emissions in China from 1997 to 2012. We decomposed total emissions into internal, spillover, feedback, and direct components. Our results show that the equipment manufacturing, construction and services sectors are the main sources of emissions during the whole period, which have a larger spillover component, primarily through indirect upstream emissions in the heavy-manufacturing, transportation, and power sectors. The emissions from the power and transportation sectors are dominated by direct rather than the spillover emissions. The shares of the feedback and internal components in the heavy manufacturing sectors were significantly higher than those of other sectors. Our results suggest that further addressing carbon emissions along the supply chain of equipment manufacturing, construction and services sectors, and improving technologies in the heavy manufacturing and power sectors holds important future opportunities for curbing the rapid growth of carbon emissions in China.

But how can countries make this a reality in the face of a limited budget and an aging population? Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.","[Zhou, Wenhui] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yanfang] Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Sch Business, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Luo, Feng] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; Henan University; University of Strathclyde; City University of Hong Kong,"Zheng, YF (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Sch Business, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China.",whzhou@scut.edu.cn; annie0605@foxmail.com; alec.morton@strath.ac.uk; fengluo3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,"Zhou, Wenhui/AAL-8470-2021","Zhou, Wenhui/0000-0003-2216-8878; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC: 71731006, 71571070, 71790615, 71431006]; GDHVPS; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030311032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GDHVPS; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"The authors greatly appreciate the comments of the editor and the referees, which were very helpful in improving the paper.

First, product partition model-K-means (PPM-KM) model is used to detect change points in the oil price sequence. Next, we apply a time-varying transition probability Markov regime switching (TVTP-MRS) model to identify the regime-switching characteristic. Then, we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to filtrate main determinants at each regime. Finally, the time-varying parameter structure time series model (TVP-STSM) is used to decompose the oil sequence, capture the time-variation of coefficients in volatile upward regime, and forecast the crude oil price. Compared with some other competing models and benchmark model of ARIMA, the newly proposed method shows superior forecasting ability in four statistical tests. Besides, we make scenario prediction on WTI crude oil price to examine the implementation effect of OPEC cut-off agreement at the end of 2016. OPEC production and U.S. shale oil production are used as two scenario variables, and the WTI price is forecasted fluctuating around 50 dollar/barrel based on three scenario prediction. We conclude that WTI crude oil price would take a shock upstream tendency in the short-term but the rising scope would not be large. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It combines the propensity score matching method with the difference-in-differences approach, which helps to avoid selection bias and track the policy impact on variables of interest at each time point. It is found that the non-western local governments tended to manipulate data on income and output growth to maintain the special transfer payments disbursed exclusively to the National Poor Counties.

This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs' green flexibility support capability. The results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets. This paper also identifies study limitations and future research directions for green supply chain flexibility.","[Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Bai, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,"Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014; Bai, Chunguang April/E-3296-2012","Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X; Bai, Chunguang April/0000-0002-9461-1632","National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71772032).",,70,15,15,2,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis, which links producers and final consumers, is a widely-used method for quantifying the EEIT. However, the role of intermediate trade in driving changes in the EEIT is still not fully incorporated in MRIO analysis and as a result poorly understood. Here, we present a framework that separately identifies the drivers of the emissions embodied in the trade of final and intermediate products. We implement this framework in a case study in which we analyse the changes in CO2 emissions embodied in interprovincial trade in China from 2007 to 2012. We find that the largest changes are a rising final demand, which is associated with increased emissions that are to some extent offset by decreasing emissions intensity and changing interregional dependency. The rising imports and the growth in final demand in less developed regions in the north and central (e.g., Hebei and Henan) led to reductions in the CO2 emissions outsourced by central coastal regions.

We use the model to construct indexes of firm-level demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in all three dimension with demand being the most dispersed. The firm-specific demand and marginal cost components account for over 30% of market share variation, 40% of sales variation, and over 50% of price variation among exporters. The fixed cost index is the primary factor explaining differences in the pattern of destination markets across firms. The estimates are used to analyse the supply reallocation following the removal of the quota on Chinese footwear exports to the EU. This led to a rapid restructuring of export supply sources on both the intensive and extensive margins in favour of firms with high demand and low fixed costs indexes, with marginal cost differences not being important.","[Roberts, Mark J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Roberts, Mark J.; Xu, Daniel Yi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Daniel Yi] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Fan, Xiaoyan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shengxing] London Sch Econ, London, England",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Fudan University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES-1125963]; ESRC [ES/P004237/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Amit Khandelwal, Jan De Loecker, the editor Stephane Bonhomme, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Amongst intermediate regimes, those with recent devaluations are less likely to experience a growth collapse, which confirms the role of exchange rate adjustment in reducing the output effects of a negative shock.

For instance, a retailer might raise the retail price of an item just before a sale and then promote the product by listing the initial price as the sales price. This paper addresses the question under what conditions would a firm give such a 'false' promotion and with what regularity? with an analytical model composed of two competing retailers and two segments of consumers. The duopoly firms sell substitutable products in a finite number of periods to consumers. In each period, each firm can choose to offer a real promotion, a false promotion, or no promotion. One segment of consumers is sophisticated and is able to discern false promotions based on the two firms' promotional offerings. The other segment of consumers is naive and trusts each firm's claimed promotional offering. Sophisticated consumers pass information on the existence of false promotions via word-of-mouth (WOM) to a fraction of naive consumers. We find that the possibility of offering false promotions can improve the payoffs for both firms, especially when the market is more competitive. Moreover, even when consumers can identify that a firm is offering a false promotion and pass this information to others, a firm still finds it optimal to offer such promotions from time to time. In general, the firm is more likely to offer false promotions in an environment with lower competition, fewer sophisticated consumers, and weaker WOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While the majority of previous studies relating to insurance price dynamics adopt data from developed economies, this paper uses data from China to provide new evidence. This study tests the long-term and short-term effects of real gross domestic product (GDP), interest rate and rate of stock market return on the prices of different lines of non-life insurance, i.e., property-liability insurance and personal accident insurance. The results indicate that the price dynamics of property-liability insurance are generally similar to those of developed countries, except for the effect of GDP, while price determination of personal accident insurance seems to be affected by a wider range of economic and institutional variables and has its own features. The price dynamics of non-life insurance in China have been identified as being connected to the country-specific economic and institutional environments.","[Tian, Ling; Jiang, Shi-Jie; Pan, Guochen] Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ning] Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Hunan University,"Zhang, N (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhangning1231@126.com,"pan, guochen/D-3056-2013",,,,,,34,4,4,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In our first set of treatments designed to evaluate the refinement with its usual emphasis on literal meanings, we find that a fully revealing equilibrium that is neologism-proof is played more often; senders deviate from an equilibrium in a way that can be predicted by the credibility of the neologism; and receivers' behavior indicates that they understand senders' deviating incentives. Our second set of treatments evaluates neologism-proofness from an evolutionary perspective in the absence of a common language. We find that the proportion of observations in which the meaning of a neologism evolves to disrupt a prevailing fully revealing equilibrium is lower when the equilibrium is neologism-proof.

This result is remarkably general, as it holds with possible interdependent bidder valuations and affiliated types. When bidders exhibit independent types, the EPA can also benefit a risk-averse seller and therefore strictly improve ex ante, or interim, Pareto efficiency of the English auction.","Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tsinghua University; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"Hu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Sect Microecon, Postbus 15867, NL-1001 NJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",x.hu@uva.nl,,"Offerman, Theo/0000-0002-3469-8334; Hu, Audrey/0000-0002-0498-9480",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [016.145.289],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This article has much benefited from the constructive comments and suggestions of the editor, Andrea Galeotti, and two anonymous referees.

IPO OVER-FINANCING OR STOCK OVERVALUATION,TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,The ChiNext Market; M&A; IPO over-financing; stock overvaluation; method of payment,FREE CASH FLOW; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; BIDDER RETURNS; AGENCY COSTS; FIRMS; GAINS; TAKEOVERS; TARGETS; VALUATION; LEVERAGE,"A wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has been consistently rising among the China's ChiNext companies over the past years, which has drawn great attention across academia and industry. Based on the neoclassical theory and the behavioral theory, this paper explores the driving factors of M&A among Chinese ChiNext companies. Two hypotheses were put forward: one based on IPO over-financing and the other based on the market value overvaluation. IPO over-financing is specific to the Chinese capital market while market value overestimation is driven by the continuous upsurge in the ChiNext Market. Our study found that both factors account for enterprises' mergers and acquisitions. They have far-reaching influences on such fields as acquisition probability, the size of the transaction, transaction frequency, M&A payment method and market reaction. Due to IPO over-financing, enterprises tend to carry out M&A via cash payment or cash and stock mixed payment method. Heavier IPO over-financing will increase the chance of M&A and leads to larger transaction size and higher transaction frequency. Market value overvaluation will lead to more uses of stock or cash and stock mixed payment on M&A transactions. When the company's stock is overvalued, the company will use the overvalued equity to acquire other companies. Greater overvaluation of the market value also increases the chance of M&A and leads to a larger transaction size and higher frequency of M&A. In China, IPO over-financing rather than market value overvaluation, is the major driving factor for China's corporate mergers and acquisitions. Further study found that the market reaction to different payment methods in mergers and acquisitions varies: it has the minimum reaction on cash payment, a larger reaction on stock payment and the greatest reaction on mixed payment. Also, the mixed payment method has the largest cumulative abnormal returns. This is different from the empirical findings in the United States and Europe. This paper provides a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for an in-depth understanding of the wave of mergers and acquisitions of Chinese ChiNext companies, and provides a basis for decision-making and policy recommendations for the government regulators and investors.","[Xu, Xin; Liang, Yong-jin] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Accounting, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Song, Shun-lin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Accounting, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xuxinfeiji@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402189]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education [2014116]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education,This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71402189) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education (Project No. 2014116).

Specifically, we first address some technical issues on the balance sheet accounts, and detail the estimations of two important asset items, dwellings and automobiles. Next, through reading the sheets, we provide an international comparative analysis, and show: (1) China's households are still on their early stage of wealth accumulation, and this trend is associated with a changing structure in favour of financial assets. (2) Although being subject to relatively low insolvency and liquidity risks, the sector has experienced, generally contrary to major developed or emerging countries, a climbing leverage cycle since the global financial crisis. These findings imply that China's policymakers should, on the one hand, make further efforts to help households accumulate wealth with an improved structure in terms of liquidity and risk diversification, and on the other hand, need to pay high attention to the increasing household financial stress and the potential risk contagion.","[Li, Cheng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Natl Inst Finance & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Li, C (通讯作者)，2 Yuetan Beixiaojie, Beijing 100836, Peoples R China.",licheng@cass.org.cn,,,"Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","This article is part of the research project Analysis of China's Macroeconomic Situation and Risk Warnings funded by Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",,45,7,7,4,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We show that for some policies, such as feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity, detailed representation of renewable resource grades is required to describe the technology more precisely and identify cost-effective policy designs. We demonstrate the hybrid approach for modeling heterogeneity in the quality of natural resource inputs required for renewable energy production in a stylized computable general equilibrium framework. Importantly, compared to the traditional approach, the hybrid approach resolves near-flat or near-vertical sections of the supply curve and improves the precision of policy simulation. We then represent the shape of a resource supply curve based on more detailed data. We show that for the case of onshore wind development in China, a differentiated feed-in tariff design that can only be modeled with the hybrid approach requires less than half of the subsidy budget needed for a uniform feed-in tariff design to achieve the same installation targets.

This paper analyses the economic costs and benefits of imposing a global carbon tax on international bunker emissions by employing a computable general equilibrium model approach. Under the assumption of an emissions reduction of 5% below 2000 levels by 2020, we demonstrate that a global bunker emissions charge, on one hand, reduces trade volume and change trade patterns between countries and regions, while on the other hand, accelerates the adoption of energy-saving technologies and reallocates the supply of international transportation services throughout the world. The net economic impact, though negative on average, is modest compared to the benefits obtained from the emissions reduction. If revenues from a bunker emissions charge are properly distributed among countries and regions, the losses to disadvantaged countries are likely to be offset by the benefits to advantaged countries. This finding provides useful insights for policy-makers: a global bunker emissions charge could, in future, be an economically feasible strategy to reduce the increasing bunker emissions through the implementation requires more political effort and wisdom.

We exploit detailed friendship nominations in the US Add Health data, and extend the Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model to deal with (i) endogenous peer selection, and (ii) unobserved contextual effects, in order to identify heterogeneity in peer effects with respect to personality. The results indicate that peer effects in the uptake of smoking are predominantly affecting individuals who are emotionally unstable.

To explain this phenomenon, we introduce uncoordinated job searches into a general equilibrium monetary search framework. Our model shows that the uncoordinated job searches by unemployed workers give rise to an equilibrium, where a firm is matched with zero, one, or multiple job applicants. The ex post difference in matching probabilities generates a two-point wage dispersion among identical workers, when the Mortensen rule is implemented in the wage-determination process. In our model, inflation positively influences the wage dispersion directly through its impact on firm's real profit and indirectly through the effect of inflation that spills over from the goods market to the labor market. With reasonable parameter values, the calibrated model can account for most of the observed responses of residual wage dispersion to inflation.","[Zhang, Min] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huangfu, Stella] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Sydney,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhang.min@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"Huangfu, Stella/0000-0003-4783-4881; Zhang, Min/0000-0001-8361-6262",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203132],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are thankful for the feedback received at various places where this paper was presented.

Assuming that each party has incomplete market information about the other, we can thus define a dynamic game relationship between employers' incentives to retain workers and workers' mobility behaviour. By using evolutionary game theory, in this study we analyse various conditional evolutionary stable strategies and explore how employer behaviour influences the mobility of the workers in this industry in China. The results show that under the prevailing employment model, construction workers are bound to change jobs regardless of whether their employers adopt incentives to retain them or not. This finding suggests that the government, as the market regulator, should reform its employment model to ensure that construction workers switch jobs in an orderly and rational manner.","[Sun Jide; Wang Xincheng; Shen Liangfa] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Wang, XC (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wxc2040@163.com,,"Wang, Xincheng/0000-0001-8027-018X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472139],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71472139].,,35,19,20,6,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

By closely integrating the prospect theory and the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, this paper develops a generalized framework of decision-making. Theoretically, we first use a four-step editing phase and a valuation phase to generate two key functions: the value function and the weighting function. We then demonstrate how to compute the intuitionistic fuzzy prospect values as the reference for decision-making. Empirically, experiments are conducted to examine how well the patterns of subjects' decision-making, under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, comfort to the framework proposed in this paper. The experiments reveal that the ways that subjects choose to deal with information are consistent with what are implied by the fuzzy logic of our framework in various scenarios. The experimental results show that (i) the shapes of the value function and the weighting function in our framework are in line with those of prospect theory, (ii) people are less risk averse when making decisions under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment than under uncertainty, and (iii) with the presence of ambiguity, people systemically underweight the probabilities of the outcomes with gains as well as those of the outcomes with losses. This paper illustrates that our methodology can elicit prospects not only under uncertainty but also under ambiguity, and the decision-making patterns can be fully captured by parameters in the value function and the weighting function. As our approach generalizes to the case of ambiguity, the prospect theory can therefore be viewed as a special case in our framework.","[Gu, Jing] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zijian] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zeshui] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuezheng] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Sichuan University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, XZ (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",hymacmechen@hotmail.com,"Xu, Zeshui/N-8908-2013; Wang, Zijian/IQU-2128-2023","Wang, Zijian/0000-0001-8770-1755; Xu, Zeshui/0000-0003-3547-2908","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401116, 71571123, 71473168]; Sichuan University [2018hhs-07, YJ201353, Skyb201404, skqy201766]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan University(Sichuan University),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71401116, No. 71571123, No. 71473168), and by Sichuan University (No. 2018hhs-07, No. YJ201353, No. Skyb201404, No. skqy201766).",,35,7,7,1,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We apply both a structural modeling approach based on the conduct parameter and a reduced-form regression analysis using different fixed effects. Identification comes from rebate level stepwise changes within each of the three major electric utilities in California and different rebate levels across the utilities. The results from both approaches suggest an average pass-through rate of direct incentives of nearly 100%, though with minor regional differences among California counties. These results suggest a relatively competitive market and a smoothly operating subsidy program, at least from an incentive pass-through perspective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Because the Phillips curve has experienced over time movements similar to those characterizing the Beveridge curve, the authors jointly analyze the two phenomena. They do that through an agent-based macro model based on adaptive micro-foundations, which works fairly well in replicating a number of stylized facts, including the Beveridge curve, the Phillips curve and the Okun curve. By Monte Carlo experiments they explore the mechanisms behind the movements of the Beveridge curve and the Phillips curve. They discovered that shifts of the Beveridge curve are best explained by the intensity of worker reallocation. Reallocation also shifts the Phillips curve in the same direction, suggesting that it may be the reason behind the similarity of the patterns historically recorded for these two curves. This finding may shed new light on what moves the Phillips curve and might have direct implications for the conduction of monetary policy.","[Chen, Siyan; Desiderio, Saul] Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shantou University,"Desiderio, S (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",saul@stu.edu.cn,,,"Innovative Team Construction project of Guangdong Province [2016WCXTD003]; STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents [NTF12013, NTF12014]; Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2014WQNCX055]","Innovative Team Construction project of Guangdong Province; STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents; Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Innovative Team Construction project of Guangdong Province under Grant No. 2016WCXTD003 and by the STU Scientific Research Foundation for Talents under Grant No. NTF12013 and No. NTF12014, and by the Foundation for Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China, under Grant No. 2014WQNCX055.

In order to get more accurate decision results, the order relation of HFSs is particularly important. In this paper, some defects of the existing order relations for HFSs are discussed. In order to solve these problems, by employing a distance measure and the TOPSIS method, we propose a new order relation extraction method based on a new additive consistency fuzzy preference relation for hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). Then, the proposed additive consistency fuzzy preference relation is applied to integrate group decision information. In multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM), it is particularly important to ensure the consensus of the decision-makers (DMs), and the consistency of the decision process is the precondition for DMs to reach consensus. The proposed method can maintain the consistency of the decision process for MAGDM under hesitant fuzzy environments, so as to get the consensus of DMs, besides, it can overcome the limitations of the existing order relations for HFSs. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the new approach, and some comparative analyses are given. The obtained results confirm the theoretical and numerical analyses and emphasize the advantages, which can ensure the consistency of the whole decision process and avoid the original decision information change and loss of the proposed method, so as to be more in line with the actual situation.","[Lan, Jibin; Yang, Mian; Liu, Fang] Guangxi Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Hu, Mingming] Guangxi Univ, Business Sch, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China",Guangxi University; Guangxi University,"Hu, MM (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Business Sch, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.",hmm0112@126.com,,"Hu, Mingming/0000-0003-2981-0616","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71761001, 71761002, 71261001]; Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71761001, 71761002, 71261001) and Guangxi high school innovation team and outstanding scholars plan.

This article examines the dynamic behaviours of incomes for both urban and rural areas with a prefectural data set. The analysis is conducted by using a distribution dynamics approach, which have advantages in examination on persistence, polarization and convergence clubs. The results show that persistence and immobility are the dominant characteristics in the income distribution dynamics. The prefectural urban and rural areas converge into their own steady states differentiated in income levels. This pattern of urban-rural gap also exists in three regional groups, namely the eastern, central and western regions. Examination on the dynamics of the poorest areas shows that geographical poverty traps exist in both urban and rural prefectural areas. Our results indicate that more policy interventions are required to narrow down the urban-rural gap and to eliminate the poverty traps in China.","[Wu, Jian-Xin; He, Ling-Yun] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Ling-Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"He, LY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lyhe@amss.ac.cn,"HE, Ling-Yun/K-2346-2012","He, Ling-Yun/0000-0003-3565-9422","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273261, 71473105, 71573258]; Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund [16YJA790050]; China National Social Science Foundation [15ZDA054]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund; China National Social Science Foundation,"Work of this article was supported by the China National Social Science Foundation (No. 15ZDA054), Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund (16YJA790050), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573258, 71273261, and 71473105).",,32,27,28,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The regressions, using a cross-country data between 1980 and 2015, show that a more equal distribution of education contributes significantly to reducing income inequality. Educational expansion is a major factor in reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Social benefits spending and price stability contribute to reducing income inequality, while public education spending helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per capita income, greater trade openness and faster technological progress tend to make both income and education distribution more unequal. The calibration of empirical results shows that we can attribute the rising income inequality within East Asian economies in recent decades to the unequalizing effects of fast income growth and rapid progress in globalization and technological change, which have surpassed the income-equalizing effects from improved equality in the distribution of educational attainment.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Hanol] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Korea University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jongwha@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Hanol/ABB-3315-2020; Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016; Lee, Hanol/GYE-2205-2022","Lee, Hanol/0000-0003-2292-0919; Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961; Lee, Hanol/0000-0003-2292-0919",Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI); Korea University Grant [K1809161],Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI); Korea University Grant,"The authors thank Isaac Ehrlich, Bihong Huang, Dowon Kwak, Myongjin Kim, Peter Morgan, Naoyuki Yoshino, and seminar participants at the Asian Growth Research Institute and the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics for helpful comments.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2015, the paper explores the varieties of existing Chinese manufacturing investment and the sectors into which Chinese companies are investing. We demonstrate in this paper that Chinese manufacturing investment in Africa is indeed expanding rapidly, yet the official data on investment approvals, both in China and in African countries, significantly overstates the actual number of investments in operation. Several investors do fit the model of Akamatsu's` flying geese': large firms seeking new locations for production as part of global networks and value chains. However, we also identified three other kinds of 'geese': large, strategic, local market-seeking geese; raw material-seeking geese; and small geese travelling together in flocks. The different kinds of firms offer different kinds of development opportunities and challenges for structural transformation in Africa.","[Brautigam, Deborah] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tang Xiaoyang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Modern Int Relat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Ying] Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA USA",Johns Hopkins University; Tsinghua University; Harvard University,"Brautigam, D (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",dbrautigam@jhu.edu,,,Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Department for International Development (DFID); AERC; ESRC [ES/M004074/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Department for International Development (DFID); AERC; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is an output from the research initiative 'Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries' (PEDL), a programme funded jointly by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and the Department for International Development (DFID) and administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute.

We further show that compared with the simultaneous first-price auction, the leader's optimal commitment yields the same net utility benefit to both of these bidders. As a result, the two highest valued bidders' incentives are aligned, facilitating coordination and implementation of the commitment. Finally, we provide characterization of the leader's optimal commitment in a Bayesian setting with two bidders, leveraging the methodology developed for the complete-information setting.","[Xu, Yunjian] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech & Automat Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ligett, Katrina] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Comp Sci Dept, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ligett, Katrina] CALTECH, Comp & Math Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ligett, Katrina] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology,"Xu, YJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mech & Automat Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xuyunjian@gmail.com,"Xu, Yunjian/GQA-6611-2022","Ligett, Katrina/0000-0003-2780-6656","NSF [CCF-0910940, CNS-1254169]; Charles Lee Powell Foundation; Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Charles Lee Powell Foundation; Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship(Microsoft),"The authors wish to thank Marina Agranov, John Ledyard, Bernhard von Stengel, Adam Wierman, and the participants of Dagstuhl seminar on the Interface of Computation, Game Theory, and Economics at Wadern, Germany, April 2013, and the Social Sciences Brown Bag Seminar at California Institute of Technology, April 2013, for their helpful comments.

Based on an augmented Phillips curve framework, this article employs both the autoregressive distribution lag (ARDL) and nonlinear and asymmetric autoregressive distribution lag (NARDL) model to investigate pass-through effects of crude oil price on China's producer prices index (PPI) and consumer prices index (CPI) in China. It is found that the impact of global oil price fluctuations to China's PPI and CPI are asymmetrical in the long-run, and the long-term impacts of the rise in global oil prices on PPI and CPI are greater than the global oil price decline on PPI and CPI. However, the symmetric ARDL model fails to diagnose the impact of oil price to China's PPI and CPI. Therefore, it is necessary to consider asymmetric relationship in the study of global oil price's influence on China's domestic prices.","[Long, Shaobo] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Long, Shaobo] Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jun] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Chongqing University; Renmin University of China,"Long, SB (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Long, SB (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",Longds@126.com,,"Long, Shaobo/0000-0003-4549-8722",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017CDJSK01XK13]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16CJL007]; Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education [13JJD790036]; Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education; Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China,"This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 2017CDJSK01XK13]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 16CJL007], the Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education [grant number 13JJD790036], and Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs 2014 of Renmin University of China.",,30,36,36,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This study has developed a stochastic energy economy -environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and non-fossil energy development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and non-fossil energy target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing plays a major role in curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the non-fossil energy target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the non-fossil energy target.

The Chinese Government is promoting the three rights separation system to consolidate agricultural land through the land rental market with the explicit intention of fostering new agricultural management subjects and improving agricultural productivity. The present paper estimates the effect of rural labor migration on households' participation in land renting in and renting out activities based on a unique dataset from three rounds of nationally representative surveys. Our results indicate that rural labor migration has a significant negative effect on households renting in land and has a positive effect on households renting out land in rural China. Therefore, the government should adopt targeted policies to effectively encourage farmers with higher agricultural capacity to rent in land to alleviate the negative effect of rural migration on households renting in land. Supporting policies should guarantee that rural migrants enjoy the same welfare services as urban residents.","[Ji, Xianqing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Natl Governance & Natl Audit, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qian, Zhonghao] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Business, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tonglong] South China Agr Univ, Natl Sch Agr Inst & Dev, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Nanjing Audit University; Yangzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; South China Agricultural University","Ji, XQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Natl Governance & Natl Audit, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jixianqing191@sina.com; zhqian@yzu.edu.cn; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673234, 71333012]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BJL009]; Ministry of Education Foundation of China [16JZD024]; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Ministry of Education Foundation of China(Ministry of Education, China); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71673234 and 71333012), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 17BJL009), the Ministry of Education Foundation of China (No. 16JZD024) and the Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China.",,43,32,32,6,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2018,26,1,,,SI,,66,85,,10.1111/cwe.12229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cwe.12229,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS7HA,,Bronze,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000419967300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four types of incentive programs and four types of penalty programs were established based on three comparison criteria. As a building-level, the first comparison criterion is the averaging approach based on similar cases that can be retrieved using a simplified case-based reasoning model. As a community-level, the second comparison criterion is one-step higher operational and letter rating than the grade of a given building. As a national-level, the third comparison criterion is the operational and letter rating as the minimum criteria for achieving the national CERT. In this study, an elementary school facility located in Seoul, South Korea was selected to validate the applicability of the developed program.

We measure media bias based on coverage of government mouthpiece content (propaganda) relative to commercial content. We first find that a reform that forced newspaper exits (reduced competition) affected media bias by increasing product specialization, with some papers focusing on propaganda and others on commercial content. Second, lower-level governments produce less-biased content and launch commercial newspapers earlier, eroding higher-level governments' political goals. Third, bottom-up competition intensifies the politico-economic trade-off, leading to product proliferation and less audience exposure to propaganda.","[Qin, Bei] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Stromberg, David] Stockholm Univ, Econ Dept, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wu, Yanhui] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Hong Kong; Stockholm University; University of Southern California,"Qin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",beiqin@hku.hk; david.stromberg@iies.su.se; yanhuiwu@marshall.usc.edu,"Qin, Bei/IYJ-6713-2023","Qin, Bei/0000-0002-9069-0716; Wu, Yanhui/0000-0001-5832-6175",,,,,55,83,99,13,156,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We find that education was a major contributor to increased wage inequality between 1995 and 2013. The returns to education remained high after 2007 despite a large inflow of college-educated workers. Although regional wage inequality declined from 2007-13, regional wage inequality among educated workers did not. Residual wage inequality increased, and the within inequality of educated workers increased faster than that of the less educated. We argue that China's education expansion seems insufficient to narrow the educational wage gap, and a lack of labor mobility for educated workers prevents the decline in returns to education in specific regions.","[Li, Shi; Wu, Shanshan; Xing, Chunbing] Beijing Normal Univ, China Inst Income Distribut, 19 Xinjiekouwai Dajie, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Li, S (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, China Inst Income Distribut, 19 Xinjiekouwai Dajie, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lishi@bnu.edu.cn; wushanshan_bnu@163.com; xingchb@bnu.edu.cn,,,Interdisciplinary Project of Beijing Normal University Income Distribution and Labor Market,Interdisciplinary Project of Beijing Normal University Income Distribution and Labor Market,The authors thank the editor Wing Thye Woo and discussants Kozo Kiyota and Sunghyun Henry Kim at the Asian Economic Panel Meeting in Tokyo 2017 for helpful comments.

Total government tax revenue is fixed, consumption-type value-added tax (VAT) is reduced in response to the introduction of RST, and an output tax exists. An introduction of RST accompanied by a decrease in VAT increases capital accumulation and welfare in the steady state. In the transition period, an introduction of RST accompanied by a decrease in VAT increases capital accumulation but decreases the current generation's welfare. Simulations based on the data from China show that introducing an 8 percent RST increases capital accumulation by 0.43 percent in the steady state.","[Li, Shiyu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shuanglin] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shuanglin] Univ Nebraska Omaha, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE USA; [Narayanan, Suresh] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Renmin University of China; Peking University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Omaha; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Li, S (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",lishiyu@ruc.edu.cn; shuanglin@pku.edu.cn; nsuresh@usm.my,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [17XNQJ01],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"Shiyu Li acknowledges financial support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (project no. 17XNQJ01).

Analyzing the introduction of universal highly-subsidized child care in Quebec, we first demonstrate that there are no statistically significant gender differences in the average effect of access to universal child care on child outcomes. However, we find substantial heterogeneity in policy impacts on the variance of developmental and behavioural scores across genders. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant evidence of differential parenting practices by gender in response to the introduction of the policy. The analysis is suggestive that the availability of subsidized child care changed home environments disproportionately and may be responsible for the growing gender gaps in behavioural outcomes observed after child care is subsidized.","[Kottelenberg, Michael J.] Huron Univ Coll, London, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] NYU Shanghai, NBER, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Queens University - Canada; NYU Shanghai,"Lehrer, SF (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada.;Lehrer, SF (通讯作者)，NYU Shanghai, NBER, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lehrers@queensu.ca,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers, one of the co-editors (Baker), Habiba Djebbai, Jessica Pan, Aloysius Siow, Eugenia Toma and seminar participants at the University of Toronto, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2011 CLSRN-SOLE meeting, 2010 CEA annual meeting, John Deutsch Institute's Conference on Economic Relations Between Children and Parents, 2012 RES annual meetings, 2011 IEB Workshop on Economics of Education and the CEPS/INSTEAD's Conference on the Theory and Practice of Program Evaluation for helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the transitional dynamics of industrial output by employing a new framework of distribution dynamics analysis, namely, the mobility probability plot (MPP), and a county level database made up of counties and county-level cities. The new framework can address several inadequacies of the traditional display tools used in the distribution dynamics literature. Stochastic kernel analyses are performed for the nation, the economic zones, and the provinces individually so as to provide an in-depth understanding of the evolution and convergence of industrial output. This study fills the gap in the literature and provides information on mobility of the county-level units, which can greatly aid the policy making process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We use a two-sector general equilibrium model of a small open economy that produces a normal and an innovation good. We show that in the presence of cross-border differences in IPRs and consequent mobility of skilled labour, the impact of IPRs on skilled-unskilled wage inequality can be broken down into a revenue effect and an output effect. We find that a stronger IPRs regime in the source country reduces its skilled-unskilled wage inequality. However, if the output effect is stronger than the revenue effect, an increase in the recipient country's IPRs protection can contribute to an increase in wage inequality in the source country. Our results confirm the importance of institutional factors, such as the IPRs protection, in addressing the skilled-unskilled wage inequality.","[Zhang, Jingjing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Leoncini, Riccardo] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Tsai, Yingyi] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Leoncini, Riccardo] Univ Freiburg, Freitag Inst Adv Studies FRIAS, Freiburg, Germany; [Leoncini, Riccardo] IRCrES CNR, Milan, Italy",Nanjing Audit University; University of Bologna; National University Kaohsiung; University of Freiburg; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR),"Tsai, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",njustzjj@gmail.com; riccardo.leoncini@unibo.it; yytsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Zhang, Jing/HII-4294-2022","Tsai, Yingyi/0000-0002-8011-9946; Leoncini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6409-6748","Government Audit Research Foundation of Nanjing Audit University, China; Agreement CNR/NSC, Two Year Programme; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2923-H-390-001-MY2]","Government Audit Research Foundation of Nanjing Audit University, China; Agreement CNR/NSC, Two Year Programme; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors thank Professor Sushanta Mallick for encouragement and three referees for comments and suggestions.

This study aims to estimate the carbon implications of these changes in the economic structure at the city level. We compiled a multiregional input-output (MRIO) model for China and used an environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) to estimate CO2 emissions in Shanghai from both production and consumption perspectives. We found that consumption-based CO2 emissions were more than 30% higher than production-based emissions in Shanghai. In recent years, both production- and consumption-based CO2 emissions in Shanghai declined because of changes in China's economic development mode.

We incorporate the idea by explicitly modelling the choice between two technologies in a heterogeneous agent model with overlapping generations. Both technologies can be improved through learning-by-doing' and adaptation of the technology to local conditions. One of the technologies is an 'advanced technology' in that it has potentially greater returns to capital deepening, and also to learning-by-doing and adaptation. However, a critical level of development has to be reached before the technology becomes appropriate; for lower levels of development the less advanced technology is more productive. Depending on initial conditions, a variety of long run outcomes and transitional dynamics are possible, suggesting that appropriate technology provides a potential explanation for the diversity of growth and technology diffusion experiences observed in world economies.","[Lahiri, Radhika] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ding, Juhong] China Execut Leadership Acad Pudong, Pudong, Peoples R China; [Chinzara, Zivanemoyo] World Bank Grp, Lusaka, Africa Region, Zambia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lahiri, R (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",r.lahiri@qut.edu.au,,"Lahiri, Radhika/0000-0002-5076-0556",,,,,29,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We use data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2002, which exclusively contains information about the lineage structure in these villages allowing us to classify three levels of lineage-based heterogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneity of lineage-based heterogeneity. We find evidence that people in a village with higher lineage-based heterogeneity are less likely to exhibit reciprocity behavior within lineages or contribute to the provision of public goods that are jointly shared across lineages. The estimation results remain robust to the inclusion of various control variables and additional background characteristics. Finally, we examine a number of other economic outcomes and find that more homogenous villages do better than other types of villages.","[He, Quqiong] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China; [He, Quqiong] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Econometr Anal & Forecasting, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Sarangi, Sudipta] Virginia Tech, 3016 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Sarangi, Sudipta] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae); Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Sarangi, S (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, 3016 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",quqiong.he@gmail.com; Ying_Pan@fanniemae.com; ssarangi@vt.edu,,,"Liaoning Provincial Department of Education [LN2016JD004]; Social Science Fund [15ZDA011]; National Science Foundation of China [71571033, 71603042]; Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics",Liaoning Provincial Department of Education; Social Science Fund; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics,"Quqiong He would like to acknowledge financial support from Liaoning Provincial Department of Education (No. LN2016JD004), Social Science Fund (No. 15ZDA011), the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71571033 and 71603042), and the Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics.",,60,13,14,3,26,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

In this paper a novel formal modeling approach is conceptually developed and presented to address sustainable supplier selection. Grey theory and TOPSIS, a distance based multiple criteria method, are used for the integration and evaluation of sustainable supplier performance for sustainable supplier selection. From a research perspective, TOPSIS is improved to more effectively deal with grey numbers by integrating a degree of likelihood rather than converting grey numbers into crisp numbers functions, and it provides more flexible supplier rankings. This methodology strengthens the sustainable supplier selection process, and can be applied to other multiple criteria decision making problems. Illustrative calculations are made using data on sustainable supplier selection and evaluation published by Bai and Sarkis (2010). The technique is relatively accurate, matching well with results from a published grey rough set approach. The methodology easily implementable with minimal complex calculations required. It can also provide support for sustainable supplier selection, benchmarking, and improvement decisions. This is one of the first papers to integrate a broad set of sustainability factors for grey-based TOPSIS and supplier selection.","[Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Bai, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,"Bai, Chunguang April/E-3296-2012; Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014","Bai, Chunguang April/0000-0002-9461-1632; Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X","National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71772032).",,33,29,31,12,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

While state 3 dominates in developed regions, states 1 and 3 occur intermittently in other regions. This implies that the demand for financial services induced by local economic growth plays a stronger role in driving financial development in under-developed regions.

We assume that the production will generate environmental pollution, which causes an extra cost that the private firm does not bear but residents with the environmental preference have to tolerate. The government pursues to maximize social welfare. We find that the residents' environmental preference has significant impacts on privatization. When residents pay more attention to environmental pollution, privatization cannot induce more social welfare, and thus the government will choose not to privatize the public firm. The degree of substitution of products will affect the results when the value of the residents' environmental preference is given, but the order of the firms' moves will not change the results.","[Pi, Jiancai; Guan, Yiwen] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Pi, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn; guanyiwen1990@163.com,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355",National Social Science Fund of China [16BJY080],National Social Science Fund of China,The authors thank two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

These results rely on agents' reacting solely to the economic content of these pressure tactics, ignoring any behaviorally based responses search deterrence may evoke. To test the validity of this assumption, this paper examines an experimental market where profit-maximizing strategy dictates that sellers should exercise one form of search deterrence, exploding offers. Sellers demonstrate a reluctance to use such offers against human buyers, but they are less reluctant to use them against computerized buyers. Human buyers are three times more likely to deviate from optimal strategy by rejecting rather than accepting these offers. Survey responses are consistent with other-regarding-preference-based reasons for sellers' actions but not buyers'. Taken together, these results suggest the benefits of tactics that rely on pressuring decision-makers may be more nebulous than previously thought. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

On average, the actual AfT received for assistance in trade policy leads to a 2% upgrade of the recipient country in the quality ladder of all developing countries.

The 2008 crisis would have served as the last straw as China experienced falls and volatilities in industrial output, export and foreign direct investment. The new policy focuses on expansion of domestic consumption and rebalancing. Given the unreliability of Chinese products, there is a need to rebuild product acceptability and market confidence. The structure of industrial enterprises, especially the small- and medium-sized enterprises, will play a crucial role in the next phase of development in the China economy. This paper uses the data on Chinese industrial enterprises to estimate the productivity performance of enterprises across regions and industries. The discussion is placed on the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the China economy and industries enterprises. By using a simple methodology and OLS regression analysis on the estimation of total factor productivity, the empirical results show that SMEs and non-SMEs do perform differently in different industries and across regions, but SMEs suffered more than non-SMEs since the 2008 crisis.","[Li, Kui-Wai] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tatchee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Li, KW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tatchee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",efkwli@friends.cityu.edu.hk,,"Li, Kui-Wai/0000-0001-9834-0027",City University of Hong Kong,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The author is grateful to the comments on the earlier draft from Euston Quah, the Editor, and the two anomalous referees, and from participants in the 2014 China Economic Conference and seminar presentation in Zhongshan (Lingnan) University.

In particular, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in production needs to be substantially greater than one in order for income inequality be higher with zero growth, in fact higher than nearly all estimates. If this condition is not met, factor prices adjust strongly causing the fall in the return to capital (the rise in wages) to reduce income inequality.

First, we cover the case of one license and show that competition has a drastic effect on optimal two-part tariffs. We also consider license auctions and design a more profitable dynamic mechanism. Next, we allow the licensor to award multiple licenses and design a dynamic mechanism that extracts the maximum industry profit. It awards licenses to all firms, prescribes maximum permitted royalty rates and positive fixed fees, and is more profitable than other dynamic mechanisms. Finally we show that a slight modification of that mechanism is also optimal for outside patent holders. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In order to explore the status of the household rebound effect in China, we manually compiled the provincial energy input-output table of China. Then, combining econometric methods, input-output analysis and the re-spending model, we conduct a detailed analysis of both the direct and indirect energy rebound effect from the household perspective in China under a unified research framework. The results show there are significant differences in risk vulnerability regarding energy rebound effect among different regions. Qinghai is the most vulnerable province as 69.23% of its economic sectors could lead to a backfire effect. Two economic sectors have the potential to cause a backfire effect in thirteen provinces. In addition, the Chinese government and its provincial government should take full account of the regional differences when formulating energy policies to alleviate the pressure on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.

These results contrast with results under non-payoff dependent deviations from best response behavior, where it has previously been shown that the Kalai-Smorodinsky and Nash bargaining solutions emerge as long run norms. We complement the theory with experiments on human subjects, results of which suggest that non-best response play is payoff dependent and displays intentional bias.

We measured institutional quality by the sum of control of corruption and rule of law indicators. We provide evidence that institutional quality positively and significantly impacts F.D.I. in developed countries; specifically, we find that a one standard deviation change in governance significantly affects F.D.I. by a factor of 0.2225 (using common law and the lagged values of the independent variables as instruments). Ceteris paribus, the results for the developing countries demonstrate that the institutional quality impact is insignificant because of the weak structure of institutions.

While the conventional production function approach only captures the direct effects of R&D, this methodology captures both the direct impact of a change in R&D on output and the indirect impact through changes in efficiency of use of factor inputs in the production process. Moreover, technical inefficiency is introduced in the model allowing it as a function of R&D. Using a unique state-level dataset covering the period 1995-2007, this empirical study finds that once both the direct and indirect effects are taken into consideration, R&D investments significantly increase outputs. The results also show that there are substantial variations in the effects of R&D on output across the state-level average farm through technology parameters as well as through technical inefficiency. Such variations need to be taken into account when designing policies for investing public R&D in agriculture.","[Khan, Farid] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Econ, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Room 352,Econ & Management Bldg, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Rajshahi; Curtin University; Shanghai University,"Sun, K (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Room 352,Econ & Management Bldg, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",ksun1@shu.edu.cn,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439",,,,,56,2,2,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Determining the origin of this premium can help to guide the gas industries and policy makers in Asia, especially when the traditional oil-indexed price mechanism fades away. Using a new systemic time-series approach, this paper explores the extent to which oil prices and market fundamentals contribute to variations in gas prices in Japan, the United States, and Germany. We find clear cross-country differences and time-varying patterns. Gas prices are much less affected by supply and demand factors than oil prices in Japan and Germany, whereas these factors are more important than oil prices in the US market, which has a pricing hub. Through rolling-windows and subsample analysis, we discover that oil prices were important in Japan and Germany, but the level of importance has declined significantly in recent years, though the contribution of fundamentals does not change much. The results show that Asian gas prices are determined more by oil prices than by the market fundamentals; thus the Asian premium is more likely due to this oil indexed pricing mechanism, rather than market fundamentals. This suggests that developing Asia's benchmark prices (through trading hubs) with a better reflection of regional specific fundamentals can lead to a more efficient allocation of gas resources.

Using data from the Multinational Time Use Study for the UK, we find positive intergenerational correlations in housework for both parents, indicating that the more time parents devote to housework, the more time their children will devote to housework. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we find that a higher father-mother housework ratio is positively related to a higher child-mother housework ratio, even after allowing for individual fixed-effects. In order to address the potential exacerbation of errors-in-variables arising from the fixed-effects specification, we instrument the father-mother ratio of housework using father's and mother's lagged weekly working hours. The Instrumental-Variable estimates fully support the fixed-effects estimates, and suggest that the latter should be regarded as a lower bound. We also present evidence of the link between housework during adolescence and during adulthood, which may indicate that housework time during adulthood depends on the housework time during childhood, which may also be affected by parents' housework time. Our results contribute to the field of the intergenerational mobility of behaviors.","[Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal, J.; Alberto Molina, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Gran Via 2-50005, Zaragoza, Spain; [Alberto Molina, Jose] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Zhu, Yu] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yu] Univ Dundee, Econ Studies, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; University of Dundee,"Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Econ Studies, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",yuzhu@dundee.ac.uk,"Zhu, Yu/F-2586-2010; Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015; Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015","Zhu, Yu/0000-0003-2805-4302; Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451; Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606",Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government),"This paper was partially written while Jose Alberto Molina was Visiting Fellow at the Department of Economics of Boston College (US), and Yu Zhu was visiting the Department of Economics of the University of Zaragoza (UZ), to which they would each like to express their thanks for the hospitality and facilities provided.

An integration contract can improve complementarity among partners (productivity effect) and increase their power in the marketplace (strategic effect). We investigate three bilateral contracts: M&A, Minority Stake purchase, and Joint Venture. By using a cooperative game approach, we characterize quite general profitability conditions. To estimate the validity of those conditions, we adopt a novel complementarity index. It shows that for any kind of contract, a significant share of the integration profits is due to the strategic effect of increased market power. Productivity gains are relatively less important, and in some cases they are negative. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the risk transmission mechanism between the oil and natural gas markets. We apply the recently introduced test statistics based on cross-quantilogram function and the multivariate quantile regression model (VAR for VaR) to the US oil and natural gas prices, which are independently formed. Our results show two asymmetric patterns. First, the shocks in the oil market substantially increase the Value at Risk (VaR) in the natural gas market, but the reverse impact does not exist. Second, we highlight the significant asymmetric response of gains and losses transmission in energy markets, cautioning about the underlying weakness of adopting volatility to measure risk in the energy market. Moreover, an extreme market risk is more easily transmitted across markets than moderate risks. Our results are in general robust in application to other regional energy markets, such as Europe and Asia, but the heterogeneities in responses are underpinned by the different role of natural gas in regions. The findings in this paper have important implications for academic researchers, policy makers in gas-dependent economies, and business practitioners in light of projected increases in the use of natural gas worldwide as well as the development of independent gas-on-gas competitive (hub) prices in Asia and Europe.

Our findings are: (i) the NAIRU has recently been around 5.5 per cent; (ii) our approach increases the precision of the NAIRU estimates; (iii) low inflation expectations have been an important contributing factor; and (iv) the long-run annual wages growth is nearly 3 per cent.

Using this policy experiment, we address the endogeneity of pension income by applying a fixed-effect model with instrumental variable correction. The results reveal that pension enrollment and income from the NRPS both have had a significant beneficial impact on objective measures of physical health and cognitive function of the rural elderly. Pension recipients respond to the newly acquired pension income in multiple ways: improved nutrition intake, better accessibility to health care, increased informal care, increased leisure activities, and better self-perceived relative economic situation. These in turn act as channels from pension income to health outcomes of the Chinese rural elderly.

The system with QL1, built on the assumption of self-interested players and myopic Cournot best response dynamics, is not stable, but the system with QL2 has a dominant Nash equilibrium. This theoretical result predicts a pulsing of contributions in the VCM with QL1. Our experimental observations demonstrate that individual contributions are certainly converging to the dominant Nash equilibrium in the experiment with QL2. In the experiments with QL1, however, the dispersion of individual contributions increases progressively with repeated trials, and the contributions are still volatile in the experiments' last periods, although we do not find a clearly unstable pulsing in the group's total contribution.","[Feng, Jun] Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, 457 4 Kamigamomotoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Inst Future Design, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Shen, Junyi] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Qin, Xiangdong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Kochi University Technology; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); Kochi University Technology; Kobe University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Feng, J (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan.",cb8226@alumni.sjtu.edu.cn,"Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012; Shen, Junyi/AFS-9019-2022","Shen, Junyi/0000-0001-5859-1382; Feng, Jun/0000-0002-7626-7540","JSPS KAKENHI [24243028, 16K13354, 17H00980]; RIHN [40410000]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00980, 16K13354, 15K03353] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); RIHN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to two research assistants, Jun Wu and Luqing Yu, for helping us conduct the experiment, as well as to the participants of the 19th Experimental Social Sciences Conference at the University of Tokyo, Yoshiro Kamijo, Hizen Yoichi, Takao Kusakawa, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

We do this by forecasting the aforementioned macroeconomic variables based on the information contained in the three alternative FCIs using a Bayesian VAR (BVAR), nonlinear logistic vector smooth transition autoregression (VSTAR) and nonparametric (NP) and semi-parametric (SP) regressions, and compare the results with the standard benchmarks of random-walk, univariate autoregressive and classical VAR models. The three FCIs are constructed using rolling-window principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic model averaging (DMA) in the context of a time-varying parameter factor-augmented vector autoregressive (TVP-FAVAR) model, and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with constant factor loadings. Our results suggest that the VSTAR model performs best in the case of forecasting output and inflation, while a SP specification proves to be the best for forecasting the interest rate. More importantly, statistical testing for significant differences in forecast errors across models corroborates the finding of superior predictive ability of the nonlinear models.

Using a Krupka-Weber social norm elicitation task, we find participants perceive it to be more socially inappropriate to discriminate on the basis of nationality than on the basis of social identities artificially induced using a trivial minimal group technique. Correspondingly, we find that participants discriminate more in the artificial identity setting.

We determine the Shapley value of this class of game through a decomposition method for this game into unanimity cost games, exploiting the linearity of the Shapley value. Second, we characterize the Shapley value for airport cost pooling game by applying the so-called collective balanced contributions property, meaning that for any two airplanes from two different airlines, the withdrawal of one airline leads to the same loss to the airplane in the other.

We conclude that financial inclusion contributes to reducing income inequality to a significant degree, while the size of the financial sector does not. Although our results are still preliminary and constrained by data limitations, they still bear significant policy implications. More specifically, fostering financial inclusion has one more important by-product, which had hardly been analyzed yet, namely reducing income inequality. More specifically, given the broad definition of financial inclusion used in our analysis, promoting financial inclusion implies facilitating the use of credit to low-income households, as well as granting credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.","[Martinez Turegano, David] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia Herrero, Alicia] BRUEGEL, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Garcia Herrero, Alicia] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Banco de Espana; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Martinez Turegano, D (通讯作者)，Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain.",elalambiq@gmail.com; alicia@ust.hk,,,,,,,16,36,39,9,38,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The procedure is flexible and simple to implement. Firstly, a quasi-closed form pricing formula for European options in the G.A.R.C.H. diffusion model is derived. This result greatly eases the computational burden for computing option prices, and well suited for our model estimation. Then, based upon the joint data, we develop an efficient importance sampling-based maximum likelihood (E.I.S.-M.L.) estimation method for the objective and risk-neutral parameters of the G.A.R.C.H. diffusion model and a particle filter algorithm for latent state variable. Hence, this allows us to infer the market prices of risks that link the objective measure and the risk-neutral measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach using actual data on the Hang Seng Index (H.S.I.) and index warrant prices. The results show that both the return and volatility risks are priced by the market. Moreover, an option pricing study demonstrates that the market price of the volatility risk plays an important role in fitting option prices.","[Wu, Xinyu; Zhou, Hailin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Wu, XY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China.",xywu.aufe@gmail.com,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501001, 71101001]; M.O.E.

Although existing models partially predict such variations, so far, they have been unable to predict oil prices accurately in this highly volatile market. The development of an effective, predictive model has therefore become a prime objective of research in this field. Our approach, albeit based in part on previous research, develops an original methodology, in that we have created a risk forecasting model with the ability to predict oil price fluctuations caused by changes in both fundamental and transient risk factors. We achieve this by disintegrating the multi-scale risk-structure of the crude oil market using Variational Mode Decomposition. Normal and transient risk factors are then extracted from the crude oil price using Variational Mode Decomposition and modelled separately using the Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model. Both risk factors are integrated and ensembled to produce the risk estimates. We then apply our proposed risk forecasting model to predicting future downside risk level in three major crude oil markets, namely the West Taxes Intermediate (WTI), the Brent Market, and the OPEC market. The results demonstrate that our model has the ability to capture downside risk estimates with significantly improved precision, thus reducing estimation errors and increasing forecasting reliability.

Based on previous studies, we link the theory with professional skill and career advancement of women. We argue that a gender imbalance has prevailed for centuries affecting women's careers; and, the transformation of accounting technologies, corporate structures, and the amalgamation of cultures have exacerbated gender inequality. Women's lack of self-motivation and men's dominance in accounting contexts keep women subordinate to men in accounting workplaces. We propose that offering courses on gender issues to business and accounting disciplines taught at university would subsequently shift the paradigm of hegemony and subordination in an accounting workplace.","[Din, Nizam Ud; Cheng, Xinsheng] Nankai Univ, Nankai Business Sch, Dept Accounting, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Din, Nizam Ud] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Business Management, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Nazneen, Shama] Nankai Univ, Coll Tourism & Serv Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Karakoram International University; Nankai University,"Din, NU (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Nankai Business Sch, Dept Accounting, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;Din, NU (通讯作者)，Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Business Management, Gilgit, Pakistan.",nixamuddin@yahoo.com,"UD DIN, NIZAM/S-1207-2018; Nazneen, Shama/O-7132-2019","UD DIN, NIZAM/0000-0002-6092-4358; Nazneen, Shama/0000-0002-1330-4930",,,,,71,13,17,7,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Fluctuations in the profitability of strategies rationalize investors' strategy switching behaviors. Under bounded rationality and limited information, such behavior is usually driven by comparing the past performance of different strategies. But at what pace should investors change their strategies? Does a frequent strategy switching lead to a higher wealth in the end? To answer these questions, a discrete dynamic heterogeneous agent model is proposed, in which agents follow heuristic rules and a market maker adjusts the price of a risky asset. Agents are classified by their propensity of strategy switching. It is found that agents with a higher propensity adopt the better strategy more often, but end up with less final wealth. This counter-intuitive phenomenon is caused by the inconsistency between short-run profit and long-run wealth accumulation.","[Zhang, Yu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Weihong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhangyu@swufe.edu.cn; AWHHuang@ntu.edu.sg,"Huang, Weihong/A-9676-2013","Huang, Weihong/0000-0002-8626-2807; Zhang, Yu/0000-0002-0028-0175",,,,,23,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The authors first discuss the relations between almost first-degree stochastic dominance (AFSD) and the second-degree stochastic dominance (SSD), and demonstrate that the AFSD criterion is helpful to narrow down the SSD efficient set. Since the existing AFSD criterion is not convenient to rank transformations of random variables due to its relying heavily on cumulative distribution functions, the authors propose the AFSD criterion for transformations of random variables by means of transformation functions and the probability function of the original random variable.

Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO2) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China's regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002-2011 except in 2003-04 and 2006-09 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level. Using robust tests, it can be found that the results are also reliable and robust to sub-samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates whether the announcement of a WTO dispute resolution case has the power to fundamentally change market dynamics. We find empirical support for this notion because REE prices exhibit a structural break around the announcement of the WTO dispute, and show lower variance ratios for all tested REEs afterward. This indicates a tendency toward efficiency, although REE prices still do not follow a random walk. Similarly, we find that stock price informativeness of companies in the REE industry increases after the announcement, reflecting more firm-specific than marketwide information and less governmental influence. Finally, we show that model uncertainty for option pricing models decreases, which we measure by the lower pricing differences among them. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, it investigates the impact of a company's announcements of the application for, withdrawal, rejection, approval and completion of private equity placement, while examining the cross-sectional differences of the market performance of their industry counterparts, both in the short- and long-term. It was found that an intra-industry reaction exists; competitors experience a decrease in stock prices in response to the announcement of the application for, approval and completion of private equity placement and an increase in stock prices around the announcement of the withdrawal or rejection of applications. Further, it was found that competitors experience a decrease in their long-term stock performance following private placements. A higher discount on private equity placement is detrimental for private equity (P.E.) issuing companies in the long-term.

We further investigate empirically the mechanisms underlying this trade liberalization effect, and find that input tariff reductions decrease marginal costs, and their effects on markup adjustments are more profound among firms with higher import dependence. Moreover, we exploit unique features of Chinese data by comparing results for two trade regimes: ordinary trade (wherein firms pay import tariffs to import) and processing trade (wherein firms are not subject to import tariffs). While the aforementioned trade liberalization effects and mechanisms only apply to ordinary trade, processing trade samples are used in a placebo test. The paper also shows that more productive firms charge higher markups for products. All these findings are robust to alternative markup measures including one estimate using physical-quantity output data, different production function specifications, a subsample consisting only of pure exporters, and estimations based on our theoretical derivations.

Following the decomposition-reconstruction-prediction concept, a combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Least Square Support Vector Machine-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA) model is proposed for quantitatively analyzing and forecasting coal overcapacity in China. The results show that the main causes of coal overcapacity in China include insufficient demand, market failure, and institutional distortion. Institutional distortion, with an influence degree of 73.75%, is the most fundamental and influential factor. From 2017 to 2019, the scale of coal overcapacity in China will reach between 1.721 and 1.819 billion tons, suggesting that coal overcapacity will remain a serious problem. The rate of coal overcapacity caused by insufficient demand will fluctuate slightly, while coal overcapacity caused by market failure will trend downward, but the impact of institutional distortion on coal overcapacity will be exacerbated. A statistical analysis demonstrates that the EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA model significantly outperformed other widely developed baselines (e.g. ARIMA, LSSVM, EEMD-ARIMA, and EEMD-LSSVM). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper comprehensively explores the profiles of the new generation of migrant workers in urban China. We find that the new generation migrants are more educated and skilled, and are likely to work in manufacturing and service industries than in the construction industry. Moreover, they tend to allocate more time to non-farm activities and have more months away from home per year in urban areas. In contrast to their predecessors, they tend to migrate to urban areas with their spouses, consume more in urban areas and send less money back home. Our findings suggest that the differences in features between the new generation of rural migrants and urban residents have become smaller and the integration of rural migrants into urban China has taken place gradually.","[Zhao, Liqiu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shouying] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Marxism, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University,"Zhao, LQ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liqiuzh@gmail.com; liusy18@126.com; wzhangtsu@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNF038],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"The authors thank the National Bureau of Statistics of China and the National Population and Family Planning Commission for the data.

Initial CO2 quota allocations are a matter of significant concern. How should we allocate CO2 emissions reduction responsibilities among Chinese provinces, assuming that provinces will not or cannot trade these responsibilities among themselves? In this paper, we allocate CO2 quota from the perspective of cost minimisation. First, we estimate the national CO2 marginal abatement cost (MAC) function and deduce the interprovincial MAC functions. Second, we build an allocation model with nonlinear programming for cost minimisation. Finally, we obtain the allocation results under the emissions reduction target by 2030. The results are as follows. (i) The national MAC was 134.3 Yuan/t (at the constant price of 1978) in 2011, with an overall upward trend from 1990 to 2011. (ii) The interprovincial MACs differ significantly and decline gradually from east to west. Hebei has the largest emissions reduction quota, and Shandong has the largest emissions quota by 2030. (iii) Compared with other criteria of per capita, gross domestic product (GDP), grandfathering and carbon intensity, the proposed approach is the most cost-effective in achieving the reduction target, with cost savings of 37.7, 34.5, 47.9 and 33.87 per cent, respectively.","[Jiang, Minxing; Zhu, Bangzhu] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Xie, Rui] Hunan Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Jinan University; IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Hunan University,"Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wpzbz@126.com,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; Jiang, Minxing/HLQ-5718-2023; XIE, rui/JXR-6421-2024","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205; Xie, Rui/0000-0001-9300-7145","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473180, 71201010, 71303174]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong [2014A030306031]; Department of Education of Guangdong [[2013]246, [2014]145]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong; Department of Education of Guangdong,"We thank Frank Scrimgeour, as well as anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that have allowed us to improve the manuscript.

In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. We show that a one per cent reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production.

This method is particularly suitable for practical application of time series and provides an innovative consistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of bubble episodes. Our results show that there are four explosive bubble episodes mostly accompanied by huge price volatilities during 1990-2017, which is largely in line with the asset pricing model (Gurkaynak 2008). The exuberance and collapse of bubble episodes can be explained by imbalance between supply and demand, depreciation of U.S. dollar, financial crisis and speculation. Our findings also provide supporting evidence for the Masters hypothesis that tremendous buying pressure from index investments contributes to substantial bubble episodes. The authorities should accurately identify bubble episode and monitor its evolving process, which is propitious to achieve the effective stabilisation of global food system. Particularly, restrictions on excessive speculative trading should be arranged under extreme market situations in order to forestall the explosion of multiple food bubbles.","[Wang, Xiao-Qing] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Lobont, Oana-Ramona] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania",Ocean University of China; Qingdao University; West University of Timisoara,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",cwsu7137@gmail.com,"Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020; Wang, Xiaoqing/ABD-8602-2021; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022","Wang, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-6660-8030; Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715",,,,,23,10,10,4,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Using a national employee survey data in 1995 and in 2000, we find that even though employers provide protective devices to reduce the negative effects of poor environmental conditions on employees' respiratory health, many employees do not wear the devices, which is consistent with the moral hazard behaviours. The probability of using a protective device is 10 per cent lower in the farms with an agency problem than in family farms without an agency problem, even after we control for medical insurance provision types.

This is especially true from the perspective of developing countries, such as India and Pakistan, where significant portions of the labour force are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. This study analysed the impact of macroeconomic policy (i.e. monetary policy) on employment, food inflation, and agricultural growth by analysing to what extent monetary policy is effective in controlling food price inflation, the effect of contractionary monetary policy on the agricultural sector's employment and productivity, and the extent of monetary policy transmission to money market rates and 10-year interest rates. We did so by applying a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005) to agricultural data from 1995 and 1996 to 2016 for India and Pakistan, respectively. We found that tight monetary policy significantly reduced food inflation and agricultural production while increasing the rural unemployment rate.

China's diet has shifted to include more fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy. Not surprisingly, GHG emissions from food consumption have also increased substantially. This analysis links China's food consumption with the emissions of food production industries in China and its trade partners to determine the effects of dietary change on GHGs since 1989. We utilise high-resolution food production and emissions data to perform a logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition to attribute changes in GHG emissions to the scale, supply structure, demand structure and efficiency effects resulting from Chinese dietary changes over a 20-year period. This study finds that while countries supplying food to China contribute little to China's food-related GHGs, demands for meat and dairy play a much larger role, driving up emissions. The overall scale of increased consumption of all food further propels growth in GHG emissions. Results indicate, however, that while food consumption in China more than doubles between 1989 and 2009 improvements in technological efficiency limit the rate of increase.","[Hawkins, Jacob; Ma, Chunbo; Schilizzi, Steven; Zhang, Fan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Ma, Chunbo] Jinan Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Econ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Western Australia; Jinan University,"Hawkins, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089, Crawley, WA, Australia.",jacob.hawkins@research.uwa.edu.au,"Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011","Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; Hawkins, Jacob/0000-0003-3107-6254; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X",University of Western Australia; Australian Postgraduate Awards,University of Western Australia; Australian Postgraduate Awards(Australian Government),Funding for this research by the University of Western Australia and the Australian Postgraduate Awards is gratefully acknowledged.,,53,22,24,9,122,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The analysis confirms and explains the asymmetric transmission mechanism and process of the smooth transformation of corn prices to hog prices and measures the mechanism conversion threshold. Using the smooth transformation mechanism and its threshold as its foundations, this study breaks up continuous smooth transfer price volatility transmission effects into completely linear, not completely linear, and nonlinear mechanism states. Based on these states, the influence of corn price on hog price fluctuation is attributed to cost-push inflation, risk stabilisation effects, and the coexistence of cost-push and risk-stabilisation effects from the perspective of adaptive expectations.","[Wang, Gangyi; Si, Runxiang; Li, CuiXia; Zhang, GuiTong; Zhu, Nengyue] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Northeast Agricultural University - China,"Li, CX (通讯作者)，Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",licuixia_883@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303040, 71173035]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science project [13YJC790142]; China's Postdoctoral Research Foundation [2013M540268]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science project; China's Postdoctoral Research Foundation,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71303040), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71173035), the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science project (No. 13YJC790142) and the China's Postdoctoral Research Foundation (No. 2013M540268).",,45,2,2,1,33,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The results show that: (i) access to public climate information and technical or physical support increases the likelihood that farmers adapt to climate change by undertaking irrigation and/or drainage measures; and (ii) decisions to adapt increased crop yield, but they did not significantly increase crop profit margins. This point appears to have been ignored by previous studies. Based on these new empirical results, the paper suggests that government should continue to provide climate information and various types of supports to improve farmers' adaptation abilities and help to reduce the levels of factor input by, for example, substituting organic for chemical fertiliser inputs.

We construct a general dynamic dual model for U.S. agriculture that allows tests for full variability and strict fixity to be performed for each input as well as tests for functional form. We estimate the model using a generalised Box-Cox functional form. Most test results are robust to functional form, but test results of fixity are sensitive for two of four inputs. The generalised Leontief is found to be significantly preferred to the translog and normalised quadratic functional forms for the dynamic model. With this functional form, family labour exhibits strict fixity, while land, capital and hired labour exhibit quasifixity. The estimated adjustment rates for the three quasi-fixed inputs are 15, 27 and 47 per cent. Production uncertainty has limited impacts on aggregate investment decisions for quasi-fixed inputs. The insignificant elasticity between state-contingent outputs suggests that an ex post analysis conditional on the realised states of nature is appropriate.","[Yang, Sansi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shumway, C.

Design/methodology/approach The authors estimate fixed effect models to track the changes in agro chemical consumption at household level over time and evaluate the effect of certified food production, using an unbalanced panel data set covering 4,830 households in six provinces over the period 2005-2013. Findings On average, the authors do not find significant effects of certified food production on either chemical fertilizer or pesticide consumption among Chinese farmers. The effects are heterogeneous across villages, but the heterogeneous effects show no clear pattern that is consistent with different types of certification. The findings are robust to the use of alternative panel structure and certification indicators. The lack of knowledge about certification among farmers, the price premium and differences in regulation enforcement across regions may explain why the authors do not find negative effects on agro chemical use. Practical implications This study suggests that careful inspections and strong enforcement of certified food production is needed to ensure that the environmental goals of certified food production can be achieved and the reputation of certification in China can be improved. The inspection of certification producers and the enforcement of current regulations should be stricter for the further healthy development of certified food production in China.

Both countries are powerful economic countries in the world, thus we attempt to know whether energy consumption and air pollution vary as the economy develops. The data for the research spanning from 1970 to 2014 was gathered from an indicator of the World Bank. The time span was decided due to the data availability of both countries. To examine the long-run equilibrium relationship, there was performed the ARDL bound test. Results of unit root indicated that all the variables were integrated of order one. In the case of the ARDL bound test, the values of F-statistics exceeded the upper bound value, which means they are statistically significant. The estimation results substantiated the positive coefficient of energy consumption at the 1% significance level in China, implying that air pollution can increase as the energy consumption rises in China. However, the empirical results of the USA were exactly on the contrary. The outcomes of the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests revealed that all coefficients in both the short- and long-run models were stable. Based on the above analysis, the study suggests that China should adopt innovation and environmentally friendly modern technologies. Specifically, China ought to inspire and motivate energy saving and low-carbon research innovations, energy saving industries, green investment and carbon sequester technologies as well as public environmental awareness creations to mitigate environmental deterioration and climate change.","[Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed; Li, Houjian; Liu, Weiwei; He, Ge] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Lingling] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"He, G (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hege01@126.com,"Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed/GOJ-8640-2022; Koondhar, Mansoor Ahmed/AAH-8768-2019","Li, Houjian/0000-0003-4852-8042",,,,,66,26,26,1,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This paper employs a partial equilibrium model which takes into account the impact mechanism of subsidy policies to simulate the impact of current subsidy policies on grain supply and demand and on enhancing grain self-sufficiency in China. The simulation results suggest that subsidies can generally promote grain production, reduce consumption, increase imports, reduce exports and increase ending stocks. Subsidies may also result in increases in grain self-sufficiency rate and stock-to-use ratio, but the increases are relatively small, indicating that the subsidies lack efficiency. Given that subsidies constitutes only a very small share of farmers' total income, and that significant scope remains for increasing subsidy levels in China, employing subsidy policies can help to enhance or at least maintain China's grain self-sufficiency at a high level.

Our theoretical model suggests that certain characteristics of an insured farmer (or farm) under both types of coverage can be sources of advantageous selection. Farmers who advantageously select are more likely to purchase insurance coverage and less likely to realise a loss. A supplementary empirical analysis, based on data from the Philippine crop insurance market, illustrates how sources of advantageous selection can be identified econometrically.","[He, Juan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Rejesus, Roderick; Zheng, Xiaoyong] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] IRRI, Social Sci Div, Laguna, Philippines; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] Univ Philippines, Laguna, Philippines",Huazhong Agricultural University; North Carolina State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Zheng, XY (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA.",xzheng@ncsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71703048]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [2662017QD011]; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects [NC02442, NC02598]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects,"Jose Yorobe is in the Social Sciences Division, IRRI, and also the University of the Philippines, Laguna, Philippines.

In order to measure the tariff equivalents of technical barriers, the price wedge method is utilized. Based on the utility function specified in the study, the constructed model is adopted to evaluate the elasticity of substitution between the imported fruits and Japanese domestic fruits, and the consumers' preference parameters for different kinds of fruits. Sample data are chosen from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 2015. Based on the estimated preference parameters and elasticity of substitution, the results show that Japanese consumers prefer domestic fruits to the imported fruits. Besides, the results reveal that although the substitution and preference parameters are higher for the improved quality of imported fruits in the context of the positive list system, the scales of tariff equivalents of technical barriers are larger than the regular custom tariffs, and the technical barriers would cause extra huge costs for the imported fruits. Especially, in the three consecutive years after the implementation of the positive list system, tariff equivalents of technical barriers almost reached 150%, and then gradually decreased in the following years.","[Gao, Qianhui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ito, Shoichi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Saito, Hisamitsu] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",China University of Mining & Technology; Kyushu University; Hokkaido University,"Gao, QH (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qianhuigaokyushu@gmail.com,"Saito, Hisamitsu/E-5761-2014","Saito, Hisamitsu/0000-0002-8090-3538","Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project) [BR2017006]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [15YJC790021]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591946]; Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation [1501051C]; Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province [2016SJD790025]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058, 15K17042] Funding Source: KAKEN","Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study is sponsored by the following several projects: Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology (Jiangsu Provincial Soft Science Research Funding Project No. BR2017006), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 15YJC790021), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Project No. 2016M591946), Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Project No. 1501051C), and Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province ('Quantitatively measuring the effects of agricultural technical extension service on agricultural technical efficiency') (Project No. 2016SJD790025).",,11,2,2,5,65,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

To alleviate such problems, a global movement towards the generation of renewable energy is considered to be an effective way to help reducing the global greenhouse gas emissions and to sustain social development. Bioenergy is one attractive renewable energy source in Taiwan because a substantial amount of cropland has been released after the participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO). This study proposes two dynamic agricultural sector models to analyse how changes in the land fertility affect agricultural activities and bioenergy development. The analytical result indicates that economic incentives such as the direct subsidy and tax credit can be used to maintain a desired fertility level. In addition, the objectives of bioenergy development must be defined in advance because changes in discount rates and planning horizons have considerable influences on the effectiveness of policies.","[Kung, Chih-Chun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Kung, CC (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",cckung78@jxufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861042, 71663022, 71663024, 71663025, 71673123]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20171BCB23047]; University Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi [JC17205]; Education Department of Jiangxi Province [GJJ160437]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); University Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi; Education Department of Jiangxi Province,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41861042; No. 71663022; No. 71663024; No. 71663025; No. 71673123), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (20171BCB23047), University Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi (JC17205), and Education Department of Jiangxi Province (GJJ160437).",,39,7,7,1,13,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach Built on a TPB framework, it was examined how perceived behavioural control (PBC), behavioural goal (BG), behavioural attitude (BA) and subjective norm (SN) influenced farmers' intention to comply with pesticide application standards. Data of 986 farmers from five major agricultural provinces in China were collected following a stratified random sampling method. Structural equation modelling was employed for hypothesis testing and analysis. Findings The results showed that PBC, BG, behavioural attitude and SN had positive impacts on farmers' intention in abiding by the standards. Among them in determining farmers' intention towards compliance with pesticide application standards, farmers' PBC was found to be the most influential factor, while SN was the least influential factor. Originality/value The results indicated that the traditional TPB constructs had significant correlations with farmers' intention to comply with pesticide standards, demonstrating the applicability of the TPB in the understanding of farmers' decision-making in a developing country context.

This paper investigates the role of local irrigation infrastructure in improving farmers' ability to respond to drought and its effectiveness in mitigating the drought risk in rice production in China. The analysis relies on a moment-based specification of the stochastic production function, capturing mean, variance and skewness effects. Using household survey data from 86 villages in five provinces, we jointly estimate farmers' adaptive irrigation decisions and their effects on rice yield and production risk. Our econometric analyses show that irrigation infrastructure in villages contributes to enhancing farmers' irrigation capacity in adapting to drought, and increased irrigation leads to a significant increase in mean yield and a reduction in exposure to risk as well as downside risk in rice production. The paper concludes with policy implications.","[Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Resource Conserving & Environm Friendly Soc, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Ecol Civilizat Collaborat Innovat Ctr Hunan Prov, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun; Wang, Jinxia] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Central South University; Central South University; Peking University; University of Adelaide,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023",,"Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71333013, 71503276]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; International Development Research Center [107093-001]",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); International Development Research Center(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),"This work was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039), the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (71333013, 71503276), the Ministry of Science and Technology (2012CB955700) and the International Development Research Center (107093-001).

A two-stage least squares (2SLS) multivariate Tobit regression model with random effects was applied. We find that impacts of drinking water conditions on off-farm labour supply may be greater for women than men but depends on the specific family role or family structure. A strong within-gender effect exists in households. For example, daughters are not sensitive to water access nor water quality, but householder's spouses are sensitive to water access, and daughters-in-law are sensitive to water quality. Our findings suggest that infrastructure development in improved access to safe water has contributed positively to reductions in traditional gender biases, evening the playing field between daughters, daughters-in-law, mothers and mothers-in-law. We also find that water the infrastructure program may actually encourage off-farm labour mobility, reducing the supply of agricultural labour and the share of household labour on the farm.

Facing fiscal constraints and growing enrolments, school systems in developing countries often supplement their teaching staff by hiring contract teachers. However, there is limited evidence on how the effectiveness of these teachers compares to that of civil service teachers. We use a dataset from rural primary schools in western China to estimate the causal effect of contract teachers on student achievement and find that gains in student scores on standardised examinations in mathematics and Chinese are less in classes taught by contract teachers than in classes taught by civil service teachers. The results demonstrate that China's education system needs to focus on producing high-quality teachers to improve the quality of schooling in its rural education system. The findings imply that educators in developing countries should not only seek to hire increasingly more civil service teachers in rural schools, but they should also identify ways of improving the quality of contract teachers. If efforts to improve teaching can succeed, rural students can learn more, earn higher incomes and contribute more to the productivity of the overall economy.","[Lei, Wang; Li, Mengjie] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Siqi; Sun, Yonglei] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Sylvia, Sean] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Postdoctoral Sci Res Workstat, Postal Savings Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Postdoctoral Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Rural Educ Act Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Renmin University of China; Stanford University","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, mengjie/GRS-3931-2022",,111 Project; Ministry of Education of the P.R.

Design/methodology/approach An equilibrium displacement model of livestock products is combined with an inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) to deduce hypothesis about the effects of expected price and feed costs, weather, and supply and demand shifters on herd size. Dynamics are incorporated using the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models originally proposed by Nerlove (1956). The hypotheses are tested using both the structural equations implied by the model, and the reduced form. Findings Results suggest livestock inventories in IMAR in general are more responsive to weather conditions than to economic conditions. This is especially true for cattle and sheep, where isolated 1 percent changes in weather variables, namely precipitation and radiation, were found to have a much larger effect on inventory than isolated 1 percent changes in expected price and forage costs. The effects of the weather variables, moreover, were found to be different for goats than for cattle and sheep, with goat numbers decreasing with improvements in weather, and cattle and sheep numbers increasing. This suggests herders respond to poor weather in part by substituting goats for cattle and/or sheep. Price was found to have a negative effect on cattle inventory, and no effect on sheep and goat inventory. Forage costs were found to have a positive effect on cattle and sheep inventories, and no effect on goat inventory. These results suggest policies to protect grassland by controlling inventory levels must be designed carefully if they are to be effective. Originality/value The paper makes a methodological contribution in that the livestock inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) is extended to include supply and demand shifters for livestock products in a partial-equilibrium setting where the industry in question is a net exporter of livestock products. The paper makes an empirical contribution in that additional evidence is provided on the role that price plays in inventory behavior.","[Ge, Wei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wei; Kinnucan, Henry] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Ge, W (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",wzg0015@auburn.edu,"li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023; Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224",,,,,18,3,4,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Our methodology relies on network analysis to identify changes over time in HSR network accessibility measured by node degree, strength, closeness, and betweenness. We show that sub-networks connecting regional centres with second-tier cities are fast built. Once such sub-networks are mostly established, they are also connected with each other. Moreover, a simultaneous rather than a sequential schedule for multiple HSR segments is at place at any particular time. Finally, we show that the HSR network expands all the lower-elevation, more populous and prosperous regions. Although some clusters are critical politically, HSR network development is still mainly driven by economic factors, which is reflected from the fact that nodes in the more economically vibrant regions present a higher number of routes passing through and higher service quality (i.e., lower travel time). Finally, in order to illustrate the uniqueness of the Chinese HSR development pattern, we briefly discuss and compare the HSR development in other Asian markets, notably Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.","[Chen, Cheng] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [D'Alfonso, Tiziana] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Rome, Italy; [Guo, Huanxiu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, Ctr Environm Management & Policy Anal, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Changmin] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of British Columbia; Sapienza University Rome; Nanjing University; University of Manitoba,"D'Alfonso, T (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, Rome, Italy.",cheng.chen@sauder.ubc.ca; tiziana.dalfonso@uniroma1.it; hxguo@nau.edu.cn; Changmin.Jiang@umanitoba.ca,"Jiang, Changmin/AAD-7650-2020",,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 435-2017-0728],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank all participants to the workshop Long-distance passengers transport markel, planning innovation held by TRASPOL, Research Center on Transport Policy-Polytechnic of Milan, and to the 3rd Young Scholar's Conference on China Studies held by the Hong Kong Baptist University for valuable comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper.

The essence of this approach is in counting runs simulated from a multivariate distribution representing the probabilistic forecasts, which enters the negative inflation regime. The marginal distributions of forecasts are estimated using the series of past forecast errors, and the joint distribution is obtained by a multivariate copula approach. This technique is applied for estimating the probability of negative inflation in China and its expected duration, with the marginal distributions computed by fitting weighted skew-normal and two-piece normal distributions to autoregressive moving average ex post forecast errors and using the multivariate Student t copula.","[Charemza, Wojciech; Makarova, Svetlana] Vistula Univ, VCAS, Warsaw, Poland; [Makarova, Svetlana] UCL, SSES, London, England; [Wu, Yinkai] Anhui Prov Acad Social Sci, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Vistula University; University of London; University College London,"Makarova, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies, 16 Taviton St, London WC1H 0BW, England.",s.makarova@ucl.ac.uk,"Charemza, Wojciech/U-4463-2019","Charemza, Wojciech/0000-0002-4748-2655; Makarova, Svetlana/0000-0001-6601-2491",Opus 8 [2014/15/B/HS4/04263]; ESRC/ORA [RES-360-25-0003]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Opus 8; ESRC/ORA; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Opus 8, Grant/Award Number: 2014/15/B/HS4/04263; ESRC/ORA, Grant/Award Number: RES-360-25-0003",,36,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Thus, the emergence of such new technology has become a major topic for organisations to study factors that have influenced the people's adoption and acceptance of new technology as well as mutual influence. Setting: The Technology Acceptance Model is one of the most studied models of behavioural intention to use new information technology. Aim: However, in terms of the causal relationship of variables in the model, one variable is considered independent, ignoring the possibility of mutual influence, and many samples are required for statistical empirical research. This study aims to resolve these above two deficiencies. Methods: This study adopts the Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory method, and applies the latest Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) to examine. Results: The results found several extra causal relationships which are not present in the TAM3 model, and understood that Experience and Computer Playfulness are the driving factors of third-party e-commerce payment, and Computer Anxiety is the core factor. Conclusion: The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated through an empirical study, and these results could be used to guide management direction and marketing strategy.","[Chen, Jih K.] Xiamen Univ, Tan Kah Kee Coll, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Chen, JK (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Tan Kah Kee Coll, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",pony1146@163.com,,"Chen, Jih Kuang/0000-0003-2357-5109",,,,,28,7,7,1,44,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The results show that China's urban economic growth has significant spatial correlation: industrial structure upgrading is the prime reason for the economic growth and the differences in the urban economy in China, and the impact of structural dividend on economic growth is positive. However, with the further upgrading of the industrial structure, the structural dividend will become negative, i.e. there is a significant inverted U relationship between the industrial structure and economic growth.

The data was collected from entrepreneurs and top executives in high-tech new ventures through an interview survey instrument implemented in China. Factor analysis and multivariate linear regressions were run to test the hypotheses. The Baron and Kenny (1986) mediation model assessment procedure was used to analyze the data. The empirical analysis results of 176 Chinese high-tech new ventures indicate that both effectuation and causation have positive effects on opportunity exploitation and that entrepreneurial capability plays a fully mediating role in the relationship between strategic decision logic and opportunity exploitation. It is also found that in the context of China's transition economy, the interaction effect between effectuation and causation on opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial capability is insignificant. The research furthers the development of effectuation theory and enriches current literature on entrepreneurial capability by linking strategic decision-making logics to entrepreneurial capability and opportunity exploitation systematically. Moreover, the research has significant managerial implications for high-tech entrepreneurial practices, particularly in transition economies.","[Guo, Runping] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Dept Technol Econ & Management, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Guo, RP (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Dept Technol Econ & Management, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",grp0925@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71602068, 71620107001]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017T100215, 2016M601388]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant [number 71602068, number 71620107001] and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant [number 2017T100215, number 2016M601388].",,45,9,15,4,43,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

For intermodal transport, shipments follow a chain with more than one mode. Generally, this requires aggregation of travel time distributions that are not additive. We propose an approach that estimates the change in transport time reliability of an intermodal transport chain based on the changes for links of that chain. We demonstrate the framework of reliability assessment for a case study of network improvement for rail-truck intermodal transport in China. Also, we demonstrate the application in a cost-benefit analysis context with user valuations of transport reliabilities from the case at hand. The application leads to the result that projects for the renovation and expansion of the transshipment terminal perform better compared with project that improve rail haulage speed. Another fording is that the effect of reliability improvement projects can be super-additive at network level. In comparison with traditional methods, we conclude that the proposed method can better estimate transport time reliability benefits when the distribution of link travel times is highly skewed. Also, it opens new possibilities for further research for measuring correlated reliability measures within networks and for performing network resilience analysis.","[Zhang, Rong; Jian, Wenliang] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jian, Wenliang; Tavasszy, Lorant] Delft Univ Technol, Transport & Planning Dept, Delft, Netherlands",Tongji University; Delft University of Technology,"Jian, WL (通讯作者)，4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",zhangrong@tongji.edu.cn; 1410737@tongji.edu.cn; L.A.Tavasszy@tudelft.nl,,"Tavasszy, Lorant/0000-0002-5164-2164",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB1201401]; Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University,National Key R&D Program of China; Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University,We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Key R&D Program of China (item number: 2018YFB1201401) and Academic Ability Improvement Plan of Tongji University.

In 2010 the European Commission 2010; European Council adopted a new strategy, Europe 2020, which stressed again the importance of innovations. Therefore it is important to evaluate the current level of the European Union Member States' technological and economic development as well as its innovations impact on it. Innovation impact on economic development was analyzed by correlating various composite indices with GDP per capita indicator. A new conceptual model for the European Union Member States' technological and economic development according to the world-system approach is proposed in this article. The world-system approach describes structure, relations and dynamics of international systems encompassing separate entities such as states. Three main roles of the states can be defined: core, semi-periphery and periphery. Core states are the most technologically and economically developed ones and accumulate capital from peripheral states. The model consists of system of indicators, application of multi-criteria evaluation methods and summarized ranking. The system of indicators covers indicators describing technological, economic and social situation in the European Union treated as objectives. MULTIMOORA and TOPSIS methods were used together in order to improve robustness of the analysis. Summarized ranks resemble level of technological and economic development of certain European Union Member States and thus their roles in the European world-system. There were three groups of Member States defined, representing core, semi-periphery and periphery of the European world-system. These ranks can be used in further studies instead of single indicators representing economic development (e.g. GDP per capita). In addition, some theoretical issues regarding multi-criteria evaluation methods are discussed in the paper.","[Li, Changxing] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Li, CX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",Changxing_li@126.com,,,,,,,48,8,8,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using handcollected original data on the background characteristics of EU judges and on competition judgments by the General Court between 1989 and 2015, we test the extent to which the legal origins of judges bear a statistically significant effect on case outcomes and that the rapporteur plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. In particular, if a rapporteur comes from a country whose administrative law has a strong French influence, the decision is more likely to favor the Commission than if he is from any other EU country.

For empirical analysis, we utilized asymmetric ARDL technique, which documents the potential asymmetric effects of outward foreign direct investment on economic growth in both the long run and short run. The empirical results suggest that ignoring the intrinsic asymmetries may conceal the true information about the equilibrium relationship among the variables and thus lead to misleading results. Particularly, the findings revealed that economic growth in China responds positively but differently to an increase and decrease in its overseas investment. The empirical evidence obtained through asymmetric model seemed to be superior to that of symmetric model and thus leads to more efficient policymaking to achieve sustainable economic development. Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing new insights on the outward foreign direct investment-led growth hypothesis. The findings suggest that firms investing abroad can bring source country benefits by securing access to key input factors and accessing advanced foreign technology.","[Ali, Usman; Wang, Jian-Jun] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Shan, Wei] Dalian Med Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Second Hosp, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Amin, Azka] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Dalian Medical University; Shandong University,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.",drwangjj@dlut.edu.cn,"Amin, Dr. Azka/AAZ-6312-2021; Wang, Jian-Jun/A-1044-2011; Amin, Azka/JBR-8673-2023; Amin, Azka/HKO-1703-2023","Wang, Jian-Jun/0000-0002-9045-7404; Ali, Usman/0000-0003-0259-9224","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672019, 71271039, 71421001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (number 71672019, 71271039 and 71421001).",,40,38,39,3,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Using a large sample of firm-level financial data and country level economic data over the period 2004-2015, present study creates a link between financial and real economy. Firms are priori classified into under-or over-invested and effect of financial development is analyzed individually on each classification by using panel data estimations. The research concludes that firms suffering from under(over-) investment problem due to financing constraints (agency problem), are more likely to increase (decrease) their investment in the response of underlying financial development in the economy. This study has demonstrated a novel approach by concurrently incorporating the monitoring and financing issues that disturb the optimal level of investments. Moreover, the findings give strong implications by suggesting and empirically proving the remedy that has the potential to balance the investment distortions by rectifying monitoring and financing deficiencies.","[Khan, Muhammad Kaleem; He, Ying; Akram, Umair] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kaleem, Ahmad] Cent Queensland Univ, Fac Business & Law, Melbourne Campus, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hussain, Zahid] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Central Queensland University; University of International Business & Economics,"Khan, MK (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mkaleemkhan@yahoo.com,"Hussain, Zahid/AFX-1188-2022; Akram, Umair/AAK-7373-2021; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/AFN-6958-2022; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/C-5173-2012; Hussain, Zahid/HGU-8912-2022","Hussain, Zahid/0000-0003-2982-1139; Akram, Umair/0000-0002-9980-6164; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/0000-0001-5552-0650; Hussain, Zahid/0000-0003-4989-6496",,,,,32,10,11,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

FCM is firstly used to quantize company financial paths of behavior over consecutive years. Financial paths are deployed to depict different patterns of failure and to understand the dynamics of financial failure. Then financial failure prediction model is built based on the proposed financial path (FP) approach. Empirical experiment is carried out with data samples of Chinese listed companies. Through analyzing financial path, it is found that there are mainly four patterns of process to terminal failure. Besides, in order to validate the prediction performance of the financial path prediction model, four prevalent financial failure prediction models, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and neural network (NN), are deployed to compare with the proposed model respectively. Experimental results show that FP has significantly better financial failure performance than other four models in terms of accuracy, type I error, and type II error. Therefore, the financial path monitors the change of financial status and acts as a prediction tool for financial failure prediction, which is a significant determinant of the financial success. Managers can recognize the financial failure signal in advance and understand their evolution trend on the future. In addition, the financial path prediction model is also an effective supplement to the research field of financial failure analysis and prediction.","[Liu, Jiaming; Wu, Chong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wu, C (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",wuchong1971@126.com,"xin, li/JCO-3925-2023; Li, Juan/JEO-6872-2023; LI, Wenhui/JCD-9947-2023",,,,,,41,3,3,2,35,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

One such cybersecurity issue relates to data integrity attacks. This paper focuses on the power industry, where the forecasting processes rely heavily on the quality of the data. Data integrity attacks are expected to harm the performances of forecasting systems, which will have a major impact on both the financial bottom line of power companies and the resilience of power grids. This paper reveals the effect of data integrity attacks on the accuracy of four representative load forecasting models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy interaction regression). We begin by simulating some data integrity attacks through the random injection of some multipliers that follow a normal or uniform distribution into the load series. Then, the four aforementioned load forecasting models are used to generate one-year-ahead ex post point forecasts in order to provide a comparison of their forecast errors. The results show that the support vector regression model is most robust, followed closely by the multiple linear regression model, while the fuzzy interaction regression model is the least robust of the four. Nevertheless, all four models fail to provide satisfying forecasts when the scale of the data integrity attacks becomes large. This presents a serious challenge to both load forecasters and the broader forecasting community: the generation of accurate forecasts under data integrity attacks. We construct our case study using the publicly-available data from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. At the end, we also offer an overview of potential research topics for future studies.

We find an overall positive effect of pension income on independent living as well as considerable heterogeneity. The positive income effects of the NRPS are concentrated among the elderly with adult children living nearby, of higher socio-economic status, and with better health at baseline; for other groups, the effects are insignificant. We also find that more generous programs exhibit larger effects.

We find that human capital investment I has a significant positive effect on export performance, while human capital investment II shows a positive U-shaped relationship with export performance. Considering the heterogeneity of enterprise, the positive effect of human capital investment I is more significant than that of human capital investment II in enterprises with high R&D intensity.

However, few studies have been conducted by analysing the references of publications with a visual pattern. Moreover, this subject has reached a certain degree of maturity; hence, a review that analyses the trends of organisational culture is urgent. Aim: The aim of this study was to provide broad information on organisational culture, including authors, journals, countries and references. In addition, the evolution of organisational culture is depicted and potential future research focuses are predicted. Setting: Using the Web of Science as a data source, we captured 1479 publications in science citation index (SCI) and social science citation index (SSCI) from 2005 to 2016 with 63 682 corresponding references for analysis. Methods: A bibliometric approach using CiteSpace software was applied to quantitatively and visually analyse organisational culture. Results: (1) The USA is the most productive country followed by the UK and then Australia in terms of publication; (2) scholars are mainly focused on 'performance', 'innovation' and 'knowledge management' aspects; (3) most fundamental theories and frameworks were created from the 1980s to the 1990s; (4) the Journal of Business Ethics is the most appropriate journal for contributions, whereas the Academy of Management Review is suitable for scholars to do a literature review, construct a theoretical framework and develop a research design; and (5) future research on this field has been justified accordingly. Conclusion: These findings not only provide basic background knowledge about organisational culture for new researchers but also provide a framework for visual and quantitative research to management scholars and fill the gap between organisational culture and bibliometric analysis.","[Cui, Yi; Liu, Yanping; Mou, Jian] Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xidian University,"Mou, J (通讯作者)，Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jian.mou@xidian.edu.cn,"liu, yan/HCI-5542-2022; liu, yan/HGV-1365-2022; Liu, Yiming/ISU-3780-2023","cui, yi/0000-0001-6109-0968",,,,,83,21,22,18,193,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The development of HSR service network in megaregions can change accessibility landscapes and create advantaged and disadvantaged cities. This study investigates how HSR service development has restructured uneven regional accessibility by developing a new regional accessibility measurement to incorporate train-service-frequency-into-the-prevailing-speed-dominated-calculations. We-conduct-a-longitudinal-study-to-examine the changing patterns and relevant determinants of regional accessibility in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, as well as the differences between conventional rail (CR) cities and HSR cities. The results indicate that the development of HSR services network has enhanced regional accessibility in the YRD rather than having the overall effect of restructuring the existing accessibility patterns formed by CR services. It has reduced the disparity of regional accessibility but has widened the gap between HSR and CR cities and increased the disparity of CR cities. Combined with a Tobit regression analysis, the results suggest that HSR network development in the YRD was highly spatially selective towards the cities that had higher CR network accessibility and better economic development performance. However, the disadvantage of regional accessibility for CR cities remains persistent, which may result in the issue of 'peripheralisation of the periphery'. Some policy implications for an integration of the CR and HSR services for both CR and HSR cities are outlined in conclusion.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China [41601169, 41871119]",Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester and National Science Foundation of China (41601169 and 41871119).

The main controversy, however, is the fact that the ongoing empirical evidences on the relationship between innovation and economic growth are still mixed. The aim of this paper is to provide further evidence on the relationship between the NIS and economic growth using consistent and reliable data from a sample of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa [BRICS]). The research has a BRICS focus and constructs NIS using historical panel data set for the main variables, that is, university enrolment rate for science and engineering students, government research and development expenditure, high-tech export and the enclosure of control variables covering the period 2000Q1-2013Q4. The study employed a dynamic panel estimation technique with a view of evaluating the relative impact of the NIS on economic growth in BRICS. The results revealed that the NIS as a whole has a positive effect on economic growth in BRICS economies. An important policy implication emerging from this study is that extra efforts are needed by emerging economies to promote the development of a NIS so as to explore the potential growth-inducing effects of a well-functioning NIS. Consequently, findings from this study have offered some persuading indicators for BRICS economies to explore the development of a NIS as a potential opportunity to speed up their economic growth.","[Sesay, Brima; Zhao Yulin; Wang, Fang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Sesay, B (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",brimasesay30@gmail.com,"Sesay, Brima/AFL-4231-2022; García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021; Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024","Sesay, Brima/0000-0002-1353-1383;",China National Social Science Fund [11AzD081]; China National Natural Science Fund [71203172],China National Social Science Fund; China National Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge Professor Wei Long, Dean, School of Economics, Wuhan University of Technology, for his brilliant research assistance, and all anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

However, empirical studies of the link change are few. In this paper, we investigate the effects of pension privatization and the central government's subsidy to individual accounts on public education spending in a three-period overlapping generation model. And then, we take contemporary pension reforms in a number of Chinese provinces as offering natural experiment conditions. Using a difference-in-difference framework and 282 municipal districts panel data over years 1998-2009, we test the pension-education theoretical link change. Both our theoretical and empirical results confirm that pension privatization is adversely associated with local public spending on education in China. Private pension subsidies, moreover, magnify this effect. Our study supports the theoretical assertion and selective empirical findings of a negative intergenerational effect of pension privatization.","[Yuan, Cheng] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengjian] State Council, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengjian] Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Johnston, Lauren A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Peking University; Peking University; University of Melbourne,"Yuan, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yc@pku.edu.cn; lcj@drc.gov.cn; lauren.johnston@unimelb.edu.au,"; Johnston, Lauren/G-3344-2015","Yuan, Cheng/0000-0001-7902-802X; Johnston, Lauren/0000-0003-3205-8015",Dyason Fellowship,Dyason Fellowship,This study received financial support from a Dyason Fellowship.,,43,5,5,6,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

However, the air transport sector of the two countries exhibits substantial differences 30 years after deregulation. Private and low-cost airlines have become dominant players in the Indian airline market while the state-owned airlines still enjoy a dominant status in the Chinese market. The econometric analysis of this research suggests that the presence of a low-cost carrier (LCC) on a route has the effect of reducing the airfare and stimulating the demand for air travel in India, no matter the LCC presence is measured by market shares or dummies. Chinese LCCs have similar competitive effects only when the LCC entry is measured by dummy variables. Airport concentration in India could lead to cost savings and thus lower airfares, but this did not occur in China due largely to the lack of a culture of antitrust compliance. In both countries, airport concentration is positively associated with traffic demand. In India this may imply an increase in consumer welfare as airport concentration increases while in China this could mean that consumers would not be able to explore their welfare benefits to the full potential since concentration is positively associated with airfares. We also find that the absolute value of the price elasticity of the Indian market is much larger than that in the Chinese market, probably due to the high LCC penetration rates in India.","[Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Zhang, Anming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Acad Financial Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yahua] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia",University of International Business & Economics; University of British Columbia; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Southern Queensland,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia.",yahua.zhang@usq.edu.au,"sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015; Wang, Kun/AAE-4337-2019; WANG, KUN/HDN-4021-2022","WANG, KUN/0000-0002-2137-9457; Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402; Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Li and Fung Institute for Supply Chain Management and Logistics of Chinese University of Hong Kong,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Li and Fung Institute for Supply Chain Management and Logistics of Chinese University of Hong Kong,We thank two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments.

Results show that the relationship between carbon emission and economic growth in China during the recent decade has the development tendency toward an inverse U-shaped curve, approximately confirming the carbon emission's Kuznets curve hypothesis in China. There exists a significant spatial correlation between carbon emission and economic growth, implying that carbon emission in a province may be influenced by economic growth in adjacent provinces. When economic growth reaches 279.91 million Yuan/km(2) GDP (at a comparable price in 2000), the contradiction between economic growth and carbon emission begins to be gradually alleviated.

By defining an escort-space model using the spatial relationships between home, the workplace, and school, this study focuses on the daily modal split among parental chauffeurs using data from Qujing, China, while focusing on the effects of different escort-space models: spatial aggregation, job-housing separation and school-housing separation. The descriptive statistics of parental chauffeurs' travel mode choices under the influences of these three escort-space models are presented. The statistical results demonstrate that the modal splits of parental chauffeurs perform significantly differently under these three escort-space models. Furthermore, the determinants of the daily travel mode of parental chauffeurs, including escort-spaces and other selected variables, are investigated using a multinomial logit model. A model without the escort-space model is also presented for comparison. The results show that the model with the escort-space model has a more significant goodness-of-fit than the model without the escort-space model. Both the job-housing separation and school-housing separation of parental chauffeurs result in the increase of car trips, while the usage amount of car in daily journeys is higher than that in escort trips. Moreover, car ownership, bike ownership, household income, residential location, age, gender, income, and education level all significantly impact the daily travel mode choices of parental chauffeurs. These findings can help policymakers create suitable policies to reduce excessive car trips by parental chauffeurs.","[Liu, Yang; Shi, Zhuangbin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yanjie] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Baohong] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Chenggong Campus, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiyang] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Kunming University of Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Ji, YJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kmliuyang@seu.edu.cn; jiyanjie@seu.edu.cn; shizhuangbin@gmail.com; haoziyy@sina.com; tsql@leeds.ac.uk,"li, yang/IQV-3559-2023; Liu, Qiyang/GRX-2678-2022","Liu, Qiyang/0000-0003-0953-7050; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7863-9371",Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51338003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYLX16_0270]; Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University [YBJJ1842]; EPSRC [EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51338003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. KYLX16_0270) and the Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University (No. YBJJ1842) are gratefully acknowledged.",,48,18,19,7,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the authors have identified a strong association between media influence and FSE image evaluation; FSE image evaluation and residents' perceptions; residents' perceptions and attitudes; and residents' attitudes and behavioral intention. However, the study found that social interactions do not have a significant impact on FSE image evaluation. The practical application of this research is that event planners should use media to promote FSE to local residents. This article concludes with the management implications for FSE planners and organizers. Future studies can build on the findings of the paper to generalize this China model for adaption to other countries.","[Li, Hui] Tianjin Univ Technol, Int Coll Business & Technol, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Schein, David D.] Univ St Thomas, Cameron Sch Business, Houston, TX 77006 USA; [Ravi, Siva Prasad] Nipissing Univ, Sch Business, North Bay, ON, Canada; [Song, Wei] Black Hills State Univ, Sch Business, Black Hills, SD USA; [Gu, Yuanyuan] Tianjin Univ Technol, Int Coll Business & Technol, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Technology; University of Saint Thomas; Nipissing University; Black Hills State University; Tianjin University of Technology,"Schein, DD (通讯作者)，Univ St Thomas, Cameron Sch Business, Houston, TX 77006 USA.",scheind@stthom.edu,,"Schein, David/0000-0001-7358-1668",National Social Science Foundation of China [15BGL085],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China Project: Study on the Influence of Event Marketing on the Host City Brand in the Perspective of City Customers, Grant No. 15BGL085.",,74,7,8,7,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

There is, however, no consensus in the literature on whether it actually matters for wages, and if it does, what are the underlying mechanisms. We empirically examine these issues specifically for rural migrants in urban China, a country where one of the largest domestic migration in human history has occurred over the past decades. We find that there exists a significant wage penalty for those migrant workers who have conducted their search through informal channels, despite their popularity. Our further analysis suggests two potential reasons for the wage penalty: (1) the informal job search sends a negative signal (of workers' inability to successfully find a job in a competitive market) to potential employers, resulting in lower wages, and (2) there exists a trade-off between wages and search efficiency for quicker entry into local labor market. We also find some evidence that the informal job search may lead to low-skilled jobs with lower wages. We do not find strong evidence supporting alternative explanations.","[Chen, Yuanyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Le] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Wang, Le] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Zhang, Min] East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; IZA Institute Labor Economics; East China Normal University,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Wang, L (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",Le.Wang.Econ@gmail.com; mzhang@jjx.ecnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Yuanyuan/GXG-2130-2022","Zhang, Min/0000-0001-8361-6262","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673172, 71203132]; National Science Foundation of China [71773074]; National Science Foundation of China Youth Program [71303149]; Shanghai Soong Ching Ling Foundation (Lu Jiaxian and Gao Wenying Special Foundation); Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [2014110310]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation of China Youth Program; Shanghai Soong Ching Ling Foundation (Lu Jiaxian and Gao Wenying Special Foundation); Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,"Min Zhang thanks the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71673172 and No. 71203132).

Of particular importance in many areas is the possibility of forecasting the tail-dependences explicitly. Most of the available approaches are only able to estimate tail-dependences and correlations via nuisance parameters, and cannot be used for either interpretation or forecasting. We propose a general Bayesian approach for modeling and forecasting tail-dependences and correlations as explicit functions of covariates, with the aim of improving the copula forecasting performance. The proposed covariate-dependent copula model also allows for Bayesian variable selection from among the covariates of the marginal models, as well as the copula density. The copulas that we study include the Joe-Clayton copula, the Clayton copula, the Gumbel copula and the Student's t-copula. Posterior inference is carried out using an efficient MCMC simulation method. Our approach is applied to both simulated data and the S&P 100 and S&P 600 stock indices. The forecasting performance of the proposed approach is compared with those of other modeling strategies based on log predictive scores. A value-at-risk evaluation is also performed for the model comparisons. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses HSR passenger flows instead of commonly-used time schedules for measuring different polycentricity in urban networks. Using 2013 origin/destination (O/D) passenger flow data, we analyse the spatial configurations of 99 HSR cities at the national scale in China. In addition, we compare the spatial configurations of three regional urban networks: the Pearl River Delta, the Yangzi River Delta and the Bohai Rim. The outcomes show that the three functional regions connected by HSR are the most dominant polycentric regions in China and that the Bohai Rim is less hierarchical than the other two. We conclude that the comprehensive Chinese HSR networks are largely polycentric, especially in the central and eastern regions.","[Yang, Haoran; Dijst, Martin; Witte, Patrick; Van Ginkel, Hans] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Yang, Weiling] Fudan Univ, Sch Int Relat & Publ Affairs, 220 Handan RD, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Utrecht University; Fudan University,"Yang, HR (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",H.Yang2@uu.nl; M.J.Dijst@uu.nl; P.A.Witte@uu.nl; kmyangweiling@126.com,"Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021; Yang, Haoran/GXH-6567-2022","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455; Yang, Haoran/0000-0001-5572-9390",,,,,38,21,28,6,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

There are totally 77 studies selected as the core literature sample according to a five-step approach. The results from literature review show evidences in favor of the important roles played by governmental organizations and port organizations as the main governing bodies of port governance. Furthermore, our analysis shows first, that multilevel governance has become a notable feature of port governance. Second, there are increasing involvements by national or regional levels of government in some countries such as the USA, Brazil, China. Third, port authorities at local level are generally holding the centre-stage position with further autonomy in managing port operations. Fourth, not-for-profit organizations related to port activities play the role of coordinators in port governance. Finally, different governance regimes with different specific governing actors for different port classifications can be identified for many nations. This study shows that fundamentally institutional arrangements and specific port activities are the two basic categories of what is governed. The institutional arrangements determine the port governance configuration and allocation of responsibilities of port activities. There are 12 groups of specific port activities within five categories identified in port governance.","[Zhang, Qiang; Chen, Shun] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Geerlings, Harry] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Smart Port, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [El Makhloufi, Abdel] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Res Programme Urban Technol, Smart Mobil & Logist, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands",Shanghai Maritime University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",qiangzhang@shmtu.edu.cn,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019; Makhloufi, Abdel El/B-5798-2011","Makhloufi, Abdel El/0000-0001-8639-4781","Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program [2016EGL005]; Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects [71774109, 71704103]",Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program; Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects,This study is supported by the Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program (2016EGL005) and Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects (71774109 and 71704103).,,58,21,24,7,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Aim: This article proposes a relative dynamic two-stage network data envelopment analysis model for measurement of bank efficiency based on the slack-based measure. Setting: Twenty-seven banks in Ghana during the period of 2009-2014. Methods: By considering simultaneous processes within the framework of two-stage data envelopment analysis, the slack-based measure approach identifies the sources of inefficiency in the banks. Results: In the empirical analysis, non-performing loans are an undesirable output in one production process, which should also be treated as a carry-over factor; that is to say, some non-performing loans from the preceding year can be collected in the current year. The carry-over factors should be used to indicate the presence of performance gaps that exist in the banks. The proposed model was used to measure the efficiency of the 27 banks in Ghana during the period of 2009-2014. We also present useful suggestions for improvement in bank efficiency based on the empirical results. Conclusion: The 27 main commercial banks in Ghana are far from efficient. For all banks, the efficiency score in the second stage is much higher than that of the first stage. That means more attention should be paid to the first stage of production in order to increase the banks' efficiency.","[Zhou, Zhixiang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Amowine, Nelson] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Dechun] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Hohai University; Hohai University,"Amowine, N (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",amowinenelson@yahoo.com,"amowine, nelson/HSI-3530-2023","Amowine, Nelson/0000-0001-8840-8737","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701059, 71771126, 71301080]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71701059, 71771126, 71301080).",,62,7,7,2,22,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

At the end of the first period, the board receives a noisy signal of the incumbent manager's ability and decides whether to retain or replace the incumbent manager. We show that severance pay can be utilized in the optimal contract to provide a credible commitment to a lenient second-period equilibrium replacement policy, mitigating the first-period moral hazard problem. Unlike existing models that aim to rationalize managerial entrenchment, we identify conditions on the information structure under which both entrenchment and anti-entrenchment emerge in the optimal contract. Specifically, our model predicts that it is optimal for the board to design a contract to induce entrenchment (respectively, anti-entrenchment) if the signal regarding the incumbent manager's ability becomes sufficiently uninformative (respectively, informative).","[Wu, Zenan] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Weng, Xi] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Wu, ZN (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zenan@pku.edu.cn; wengxi125@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,"Weng, Xi/0000-0001-8383-0461",,,,,26,2,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

To partially address this gap, we construct a Chinese Patent Database linking State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patents to all listed firms and their subsidiaries in China, and we are making the database publicly available to the research community. We first develop a computer program to match the assignee names of SIPO patents to the names of listed firms and subsidiaries based on a similarity score, taking into account unique challenges associated with Chinese firm-names and Chinese characters. High-scoring likely matches are then checked manually to determine whether they are indeed true matches. The resulting database includes 191,325 SIPO patents matched to listed firms in China from 1990 to 2010. Using this database, we find a large amount of patenting heterogeneity across firms of different geographic locations, technological foci, and ownership types. We also leverage strengths of the data to conduct a detailed analysis of the patent examination process at the SIPO. Although there is not much difference in the examination process between listed firms and their nonlisted counterparts in China, substantial differences exist between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms experience substantial delay in publishing patent applications and requesting for substantive examination compared to Chinese firms. Such delay accounts for 40-60% of the longer duration from application date to decision date for foreign firms. However, after accounting for such delay, foreign firms still face much longer pendency in reaching an examination outcome (grant, withdrawal, or refusal) than Chinese firms. We hope that the public database and such analysis will encourage new streams of research on Chinese patents to improve our knowledge of China's fast-changing innovation landscape.","[He, Zi-Lin] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Tong, Tony W.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tong, Tony W.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Zhang, Yuchen] Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [He, Wenlong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tilburg University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Tulane University; University of International Business & Economics,"Tong, TW (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",z.l.he@uvt.nl; tonytong@purdue.edu; yzhang54@tulane.edu; wenlong.he@uibe.edu.cn,"Tong, Tony W/E-6103-2010; Zhang, Yuchen/GYI-8858-2022","He, Zi-Lin/0000-0002-1756-9960; , Wenlong/0000-0002-6328-9767",State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272131],State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71272131) for supporting this research.

No sector of the economy is more reliant on climate than agriculture. Evidence from the American settlement process suggests that societies can successfully adapt to new climatic environments. Whether and how much agriculture will manage to adapt to a changing climate remains an open question in the empirical economics literature, however. This article reviews the existing evidence on weather and/or climate impacts on agricultural outcomes from the economics literature, with a focus on methodological questions. Some key econometric issues associated with climate impact measurement are discussed.

This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

Significant discrepancies are detected for both WTPs for an individual attribute and the total WTPs (the sum of all WTPs for individual attributes in each CE), and in most cases WTPs decrease as a result of excluding the ignored attributes. Changes in WTP are mainly driven by the variation of choice task complexity. However, there is no significant difference in the influence of excluding nonattended attributes on the WTPs for the same attended attribute in different subsamples. In addition, we also find that consumers in China have significantly higher but dispersed WTP values for imported (11.6-47.0%), organic (6.9-52.5%), and probiotics (7.3-35.5%) and sugar-free (5.9-26.0%) attributes for baby milk formula.","[Quan, Shiwen] China Acad Social Sci, Inst Rural Dev, Jian Guo Men Nei Str 5, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yinchu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, MZG 10-121,Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bao, Te] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Renmin University of China; University of Gottingen; Nanyang Technological University,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, MZG 10-121,Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",quanshiwen@163.com; zengyc@ruc.edu.cn; xyu@uni-goettingen.de; baote@ntu.edu.sg,"Bao, Te/S-2353-2019","Bao, Te/0000-0001-6397-9365; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",MOE of Singapore [M4011676]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [RTG1666]; SUG grant of Nanyang Technological University [M4081740]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71633005],"MOE of Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); SUG grant of Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank editor Dr. Rigoberto Lopez and three anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

This study constructs a tail risk network to present overall systemic risk of Chinese financial institutions, given the macroeconomic and market externalities. Employing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method of high-dimensional models, our results show that firm's idiosyncratic risk can be affected by its connectedness with other institutions. The risk spillover effect from other companies is the main driving factor of firm-specific risk, comparing with macroeconomic state, firm characteristics and historical price movement. The number of connections between institutions significantly increases during June 2014 to June 2016. Moreover, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistic to test significance of systemic risk beta based on tail risk and further rank the systemic risk contribution. Finally, we test the determinants of systemic risk contribution in a forward-looking way. Regulators could detect those firms that are most threatening to the stability of system.

German law mandates that firms' supervisory boards consist of an equal number of employees' and owners' representatives. This requirement, however, applies only to firms with more than two thousand domestic employees. We exploit this discontinuity and the law's introduction in 1976 for identification and find that direct employee power increases financial leverage. This is explained by a supply side effect: as banks' interests are similar to those of employees, higher employee power reduces agency conflicts with debt providers, leading to better financing conditions. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of direct employee influence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that mispricing has a significant positive effect on companies' equity financing and debt financing regardless of financial constraints. Specifically, we find that the positive effect of mispricing on equity financing of high financial-constraints companies is lower than that of low financial-constraints companies.

Simulations help clarify how much the thick-market effect amplifies the impact of unemployment. A three-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate lowers the price by 10.74% and reduces the transaction volume by 5.49%.

However, the current structure of imported goods from the Baltic States to China is different from the results of complementarity analysis.

The results show that the yield-to-maturity curve used by the Nigerian bond market generally appears flatter and more linear, relative to the modeled zero-coupon yield curve.

Social capital is distinguished into bonding and bridging dimensions, with the former referring to the internal aspect of social capital and the latter the external Guanxi (meaning relationship) possessed by core members. The statistical results display that specific dimensions of social capital may not deliver the benefits expected by cooperative practitioners and academics. Both positive and negative effects of social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives, while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase because of member heterogeneity.","[Xu, Yining; Liang, Qiao; Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Liang, Q (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@126.com,,"Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573227, 71333011]; Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [17NDJC93YB]; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [14CJY042]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573227, Grant No. 71333011), the Zhejiang Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 17NDJC93YB), and National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (Grant No. 14CJY042).",,63,20,21,10,49,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

From a firm-level dataset covering 51 developed and developing countries for 1989 through 2013, we find that in countries with stronger creditor rights, firms tend to have higher credit ratings. We confirm that in these countries, firms with higher credit ratings exhibit a greater issuance of public debt than that of equity. As further evidence that credit ratings reduce agency costs of debt, we find that improvements in creditor rights and resulting higher credit ratings increase capital expenditures among firms experiencing severe bondholder-shareholder conflicts.

A winner-loser portfolio approach shows that return seasonality is economically significant in advanced markets but not in emerging markets. We conduct statistical, rational and behavioral analyses to explore the potential reasons for the seasonality observed in advanced markets and find that regression bias, the January effect, and the Fama-French-Carhart type risk premium all can partially explain this seasonality difference.","[Li, Fengyun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Fengyun] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huacheng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Dazhi] West Chester Univ, W Chester, PA USA",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania,"Zhang, HC (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhanghuacheng1@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,12,13,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Leverage responds more to decreases in the marginal tax rate, and it responds to changes in the marginal rather than the average tax rate. Most importantly, we find that the marginal tax rate based on tax returns has greater explanatory power for companies' leverage than the marginal tax rate based on financial statements.

We choose two specifications of the adaptive models: a simple local AR (LAR) model for a univariate implied volatility series and an adaptive dynamic Nelson-Siegel (ADNS) model of three factors, each based on an LAR, to model the cross-section of the TSIV simultaneously with parsimony. Both LAR and ADNS models uniformly outperform more than a dozen alternative models with significance across maturities for 1-20 day forecast horizons. Measured by RMSE and MAE, the forecast errors of the random walk model can be reduced by between 20% and 60% for the 5 to 20 days ahead forecast. In terms of prediction accuracy of future directional changes, the adaptive models achieve an accuracy range of 60%-90%, which strictly dominates the range of 30%-59% of the alternative models.","[Chen, Ying] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore, Singapore; [Han, Qian; Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Han, Qian; Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Gregory & Paula Chow Ctr Econ Res, Xiamen, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Niu, LL (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Rm A306,Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",llniu@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund [FRC R-155-000-178-114]; Institute of Data Science grant at the National University of Singapore [R-155-000-185-646]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71528008]; NSFC [71528008, 71471153, 7163000017, 71273007]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany through the SFB 649 Economic Risk; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [20720181004]; Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant [R-155-000-199-114]","Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Institute of Data Science grant at the National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Germany through the SFB 649 Economic Risk(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant(National University of Singapore)","Ying Chen acknowledges the support of the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant (FRC R-155-000-178-114), Institute of Data Science grant (R-155-000-185-646) at the National University of Singapore, and Humboldt Universitaet zu Berlin-National University of Singapore Joint Grant (R-155-000-199-114) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Grant (No. 71528008).

In a scale-invariant Schumpeterian growth model with endogenous fertility and a cash-in-advance constraint on consumption, we find a positive effect of an increase in the nominal interest rate on fertility. The increase in fertility decreases labor supplied to production and R&D, which in turn decreases long-run growth. Calibration shows that long-run growth increases 0.12% by reducing the nominal interest rate from 9.6% to 0%, and the welfare gain is equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of 3.14%. As an empirical test, we build panel data for 12 advanced countries during 2000-2014. We use the degree of central bank independence and money growth as the instruments for inflation. We find that the effect of inflation on population growth is positive and significant in instrumental variables estimation. Our results remain robust to using birth rate or fertility rate as the dependent variable. An increase in annual inflation of 1 percentage point would bring an increase of 0.06 percentage point in the annual growth of the total population. Our empirical findings provide support for our theory.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",heqichun@cufe.edu.cn,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",,,,,31,9,9,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This implementation of the largest social pension program in the world offers a unique setting for studying the economics of intergenerational relationships during development, given the rapidity of China's population aging, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level. We draw on rich household surveys from two provinces at distinct development stages - impoverished Guizhou and relatively well-off Shandong - to better understand heterogeneity in the impact of pension benefits. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that around the pension eligibility age cut-off, the NRPS significantly reduces intergenerational co-residence, especially between elderly parents and their adults sons; promotes pensioners' healthcare service consumption; and weakens (but does not supplant) non-pecuniary and pecuniary transfers across three generations. These effects are much larger in less developed Guizhou province. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a socio-ecological framework, we model the extent to which individual-level characteristics, social environment factors and perceptions of physical environment factors at the neighbourhood and metropolitan scales influence choice of the bicycle as the main transport mode. An exploratory factor analysis distilled the indicators of the latent constructs of the socio-ecological framework into factors, which reflect physical environment challenges and opportunities perceived at the neighbourhood and metropolitan scales; influence of significant others; perceived status symbol of the bike; and perceived commuting benefits of bicycling. A binary logistic regression analysis of the determinants of utility cycling shows that while overall, bicycle ownership is an important determinant of cycling, between the genders, males are more likely to bicycle than females. Also, cyclists are more likely to be non-tertiary educated individuals. Whereas 'perceived neighbourhood-scale challenges' decrease the odds of cycling, 'perceived neighbourhood-scale opportunities', which reflect the availability of bicycle lanes, alternative roads and traffic control measures increase the likelihood of cycling among the study respondents. An interaction term between neighbourhood-scale physical environment opportunities and challenges, however, correlates negatively with cycling, suggesting that overall the metropolitan physical environment is not ideal for cycling. The study points to a huge potential for cycling in the metropolis and provides an empirical basis for interventions needed to remove barriers to bicycle commuting.","[Acheampong, Ransford A.; Siiba, Alhassan] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Acheampong, Ransford A.; Siiba, Alhassan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Trinity College Dublin; University of Hong Kong,"Acheampong, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Acheampr@tcd.ie,"Acheampong, Ransford/AAK-8200-2020","Acheampong, Ransford/0000-0002-2712-3866; Siiba, Alhassan/0000-0002-7030-7927",,,,,61,29,30,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our generalized q model informs us to use corporate credit-risk information to predict investments when empirical measurement issues of Tobin's average q are significant (e.g., equity is much more likely to be mis-priced than debt), as in Philippon (2009). We find, consistent with our theory, that credit spreads and bond q have significant predictive powers on micro-level and aggregate investments corroborating the recent empirical work of Gilchrist and Zakrajgek (2012). We also show that the quantitative effects of the stochastic interest rates and capital illiquidity on investment, Tobin's average q, the duration and user cost of capital, and the value of growth opportunities are substantial.

Using survey and field experiment data, we find that certification resulted in reduced harvesting, and the effect was larger for households who are more risk averse and exhibited distorted probability weighting. In contrast, loss averse households increased harvesting after certification.

As the industry export price can be approximated by the industry export unit value, our work provides a rigorous theoretical justification for several empirical studies that use export unit value as a proxy for export quality. We then convert our theoretical model-based structural relationships into a system of equations. Using industry level panel data from China's manufacturing sector, and measuring the industry export quality by the industry export unit value, we find that an increase in foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector contributes to a significant increase in China's export quality. We also distinguish between foreign presence in China originating from the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (HMT) and non-HMT regions. We find that foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector that originates from the HMT region leads to a much larger increase in China's export quality. The main empirical result is found to be robust with respect to alternative measures of foreign presence and aggregate demand.","[Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, 2800 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sizhong] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, 1 James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; James Cook University,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",SAnwar@usc.edu.au; Sizhong.sun@jcu.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023; Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",,,,,35,47,49,9,98,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We find that public firms' patents rely more on existing knowledge, are more exploitative, and are less likely in new technology classes, while private firms' patents are broader in scope and more exploratory. We investigate whether these strategies are due to differences in firm information environments, CEO risk preferences, firm life cycles, corporate acquisition policies, or investment horizons between these two groups of firms. Our evidence suggests that the shorter investment horizon associated with public equity markets is a key explanatory factor.","[Gao, Huasheng] Fudan Univ, Fanhai Int Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Po-Hsuan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Kai] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Fudan University; University of Hong Kong; University of British Columbia,"Gao, HS (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Fanhai Int Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",huashenggao@fudan.edu.cn; paulhsu@hku.hk; kai.li@sauder.ubc.ca,"Hsu, Po-Hsuan/ABG-3134-2021; Li, Kai/AAJ-8376-2021; Hsu, Po-Hsuan/F-4455-2011; Gao, Huasheng/L-6061-2015","Li, Kai/0000-0002-3845-3895; Hsu, Po-Hsuan/0000-0001-6234-8289; Gao, Huasheng/0000-0001-6277-4341","Research Grants Council in Hong Kong [17500015]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC Grant) [435-2013-0023]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Research Grants Council in Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC Grant); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful for helpful comments from an anonymous referee, Andres Almazan, Julian Atanassov, Jan Bena, Thomas Chemmanur, Guoli Chen, Bill Kerr, Tomislav Ladika, Alexander Ljunqgvist, Paul Malatesta (the editor), Gustavo Manso, Ron Masulis, Hernan Ortiz-Molina, Neslihan Ozkan, Ivan Png, Jay Ritter, Morten Sorensen, Xuan Tian, Cheng-Wei Wu, Ting Xu, Yu Yuan, Alminas Zaldokas, seminar participants at Boston University, Harvard Business School, Nanyang Technological University, National Chengchi University, Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, University of Bristol, University of British Columbia, University of Exeter, University of Hong Kong, University of International Business and Economics, University of Oklahoma, and conference participants at the 2013 Conference on the Theories and Practices of Securities and Financial Markets, the 2014 Financial Management Association Asia Pacific Conference, the 2014 International Conference on Corporate Finance and Financial Markets, and the 2014 China International Conference in Finance.

However, no research comprehensively assesses the sensitivity of empirical results in corporate finance to different measures of firm size. This paper fills this hole by providing empirical evidence for a measurement effect in the size effect. In particular, we examine the influences of employing different proxies (total assets, total sales, and market capitalization) of firm size in 20 prominent areas in empirical corporate finance research. We highlight several empirical implications. First, in most areas of corporate finance the coefficients of firm size measures are robust in sign and statistical significance. Second, the coefficients on regressors other than firm size often change sign and significance when different size measures are used. Unfortunately, this suggests that some previous studies are not robust to different firm size proxies. Third, the goodness of fit measured by R-squared also varies with different size measures, suggesting that some measures are more relevant than others in different situations. Fourth, different proxies capture different aspects of firm size, and thus have different implications. Therefore, the choice of size measures needs both theoretical and empirical justification. Finally, our empirical assessment provides guidance to empirical corporate finance researchers who must use firm size measures in their work. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the findings in advanced markets, we find that positive feedback traders are already prevalent before the introduction of index futures in six out of the seven markets studied. After the introduction of index futures, signs of positive feedback trading emerge in only two markets (India and Poland). In contrast to the evidence in developed markets, positive feedback traders migrate from spot to futures markets in four markets, which suggests that the introduction of index futures may destabilize some emerging stock markets. Another interesting finding is that positive feedback trading becomes more intense when there is a market decline in the majority of the markets.","[Kutan, Ali M.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Shi, Yukun; Wei, Mingzhe] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; University of Glasgow; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yukun.shi@glasgow.ac.uk; zhaoyang8@jxufe.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; wei, mingzhe/0000-0002-8817-7788",Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province [JD16063],Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province,We wish to thank the two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Based on a simple perpetual discounted cash flow model, we argue that the valuation will be lower for a target with higher information uncertainty and acquiring a target with high information uncertainty can potentially create value for an acquirer's shareholders. The empirical findings lend support to our arguments. Specifically, we observe that a target's valuation multiple obtained from an acquirer is negatively correlated with the target's information uncertainty level. An acquirer's announcement return is negatively correlated with the valuation multiple given to the target but positively correlated with the target's information uncertainty level. The results are robust against various measurements of valuation multiples and information uncertainty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Web mapping services provide a new mechanism to acquire the travel cost indicators directly, saving significant time for data collection and complex calculations. Meanwhile, the spatial interaction model gives the opportunity to estimate the traveling probability and population at the macro scale without actual mobility data. In this study, we introduce population grid data into the new Gravity-Radiation model for population flow estimation, and utilize Google Maps API to acquire travel costs at grid level. Then, the new estimated potential traveling population (EPTP) weighted travel costs are proposed to measure the overall accessibility at multiple scales. The results show that the EPTP is strongly correlated with the resident population at both the SUA (significant urban area, roughly equal to city) and state levels in Australia. The national EPTP weighted travel time to SUM with maximum traveling probability is 0.26 h with an average speed of 42.53 km/h.

Our approach captures the main topological and spatial changes from a complex network perspective. We find that the SAAN combines a relatively stable topological structure with a changing multilayered geographical structure. Statistical analysis indicates that the SAAN is a scale-free network with an increasing number of hub cities and has been characterized by small-world properties since 1996. Furthermore, the SAAN exhibits a recently intensified disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting an increasing dependence of small cities on hub-and-spoke configuration for better accessibility. A decomposition analysis is used to disaggregate the SAAN into a hierarchical core-bridge-periphery structure. The core layer consists of capital cities, the most economic vibrant secondary cities, and tourist destinations. This core layer is also densely interconnected with its center of gravity moving towards the north. The periphery layer, comprised of cities in remote areas, sustains a low significance with declining internal connectivity despite a rising number of cities being connected. The bridge layer lies in between both extremes, and is characterized by a high volatility over time. The connections and passengers between different layers increase, especially those between core and bridge after 1996. In our discussion, we trace these changes back to a series of socio-economic and politico-institutional dynamics in Southeast Asia.","[Dai, Liang; Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Liu, Xingjian] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, 8-F Knowles Bldg, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Ghent University; University of Hong Kong,"Derudder, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",liang.dai@ugent.be; ben.derudder@ugent.be; xliu6@hku.hk,"Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008; Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020","Liu, Xingjian/0000-0003-4158-3655; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,73,61,72,6,92,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our analysis exploits China's 2008 mandate requiring firms to disclose CSR activities, using a difference-in-differences design. Although the mandate does not require firms to spend on CSR, we find that mandatory CSR reporting firms experience a decrease in profitability subsequent to the mandate. In addition, the cities most impacted by the disclosure mandate experience a decrease in their industrial wastewater and SO2 emission levels. These findings suggest that mandatory CSR disclosure alters firm behavior and generates positive externalities at the expense of shareholders. (C) 2017 The Authors.

It extends earlier work by measuring protection from NTMs over time from a newly available database and provides evidence on the evolution of NTMs. In particular, building on Kee et al.

We show that the incidence and the intensity of NTMs were both increasing over this period, with NTMs becoming an even more dominant source of trade protection. We are also able to investigate the evolution of overall protection derived jointly from tariffs and NTMs. The results show that the overall protection level, for most countries and products, has not decreased despite the fall in tariffs associated with multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements in recent decades. We also document an increase in overall trade protection during the recent 2008 financial crisis. Overall, this study sheds light on an under-researched aspect of trade liberalization: the proliferation and increase of NTMs.","[Niu, Zhaohui] Beihang Univ, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gunessee, Saileshsingh] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Milner, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Beihang University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham,"Milner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",chris.milner@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,43,45,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

These non-traditional loans, including interest-only and negative-amortization mortgages, enable households to postpone loan repayment in contrast to fully amortizing traditional mortgages. Contrary to common perception, complex mortgages are used by households with high-income levels and prime credit scores, quite unlike the low-income population targeted by subprime mortgages. Nonetheless, we find that complex-mortgage borrowers become delinquent on their mortgages at rates twice as high as borrowers with plain-vanilla fixed-rate contracts even after controlling for household and loan characteristics.

After considering various locational and contextual factors, this study focuses specifically on how HSR stations and the frequency of train services have affected the dynamics of commercial land markets, using a spatial panel approach. The results show that the opening of HSR services has significantly impacted trade volumes, while the frequency of train services has significantly affected trade prices. Further analysis shows variation in the impacts of HSR stations and train service frequency on commercial land markets between Jiangsu's developed south and less-developed central and northern sub-regions. The findings suggest that the study of HSR impacts is sensitive to the selected spatial scale. Moreover, HSR development may not result in the creation of dynamic commercial economies for every city. Consequently, locally based policies are needed to take advantage of the transport-induced opportunities.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Manchester Urban Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Yuan, Feng; Duan, Xuejun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Duan, XJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk; xjduan@niglas.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20161088]","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province)","This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20161088).

However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.","[Tu, Wei; Yue, Yang; Zhou, Baoding; Li, Qingquan] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Res Inst Smart Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wei; Yue, Yang; Zhou, Baoding; Li, Qingquan] Shenzhen Univ, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & GeoInformat, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingquan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cao, Rui] Univ Nottingham, Int Doctoral Innovat Ctr, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiuping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Ctr Integrated Geog Informat Anal, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Wuhan University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Sun Yat Sen University,"Tu, W (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Room 1402,Sci & Technol Bldg,3688 Nanhai Ave, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tuwei@szu.edu.cn,"JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023; Cao, Rui/AAL-3946-2020; Yue, Yang/AAE-1652-2019; TU, Wei/H-4073-2014","Cao, Rui/0000-0002-1440-4175; Yue, Yang/0000-0001-6934-2357; TU, Wei/0000-0002-0255-4037; Li, Qingquan/0000-0002-2438-6046","National Science Foundation of China [41401444, 91546106]; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program [JCYJ20170412105839839, CXZZ20150504141623042]; open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources [KF-2016-02-009, KF-2016-02-010]; Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research [K-17014-01]; International Doctoral Innovation Centre; Ningbo Education Bureau; Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau; University of Nottingham; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L015463/1]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program; open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources; Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research; International Doctoral Innovation Centre; Ningbo Education Bureau; Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau; University of Nottingham; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (#41401444, #91546106), Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program (#JCYJ20170412105839839, #CXZZ20150504141623042), the open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources (#KF-2016-02-009, #KF-2016-02-010), and the Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research: [#K-17014-01], the International Doctoral Innovation Centre, Ningbo Education Bureau, Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau, the University of Nottingham, and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [#EP/L015463/1].",,49,131,145,25,294,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

To capture respondents' relative deprivation, we use self-reported information on respondents' perception of the relative standing of their household in comparison to those of their neighbors. Controlling for households' absolute income and other relevant subjective dimensions, we illustrate that households' relative position vis-a-vis their reference groups plays an important role in determining the intentions of their members to migrate abroad. In particular, individuals are more willing to engage in temporary emigration if they perceive themselves to be poorer than the reference group. Our results may have important policy implications. A conjectural suggestion of our empirical exercise is that if migration has to be curbed, reducing absolute poverty alone may not be sufficient. In addition, policy-makers may need to decrease relative income differentials within the country.","[Antinyan, Armenak] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Corazzini, Luca] CaFoscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 821, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Antinyan, A (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",antinyan.armenak@gmail.com,"Antinyan, Armenak/AAT-9633-2020","Antinyan, Armenak/0000-0001-9960-3618",,,,,75,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

On this basis, we calculate a rate of implicit rentability of this global capital in order to test the validity of what Piketty presents as a fundamental unbalance, comparing in the long term the rate of return of capital and the growth rate of income. Piketty's economic law, linking the coefficient of capital to the ratio savings rate - growth rate, is then examined (part 2).

The narratives of public and political discussions, as well as of some widely cited papers, suggest this possibility. In this paper, we will investigate the possible existence of such a vicious cycle. We find no evidence of a bad long-run equilibrium and cannot confirm a feedback loop leading into default as a transitory state for all but the very worst ratings. We use a bivariate semiparametric dynamic panel model to reproduce the joint dynamics of sovereign ratings and government bond yields. The individual equations resemble Pesaran-type cointegration models, which allow for valid interference regardless of whether the employed variables display unit-root behavior. To incorporate most of the empirical features previously documented (separately) in the literature, we allow for different long-run relationships in both equations, nonlinearities in the level effects of ratings, and asymmetric effects in changes of ratings and yields. Our finding of a single good equilibrium implies the slow convergence of ratings and yields toward this equilibrium. However, the persistence of ratings is sufficiently high that a rating shock can have substantial costs if it occurs at a highly speculative rating or lower. Rating shocks that drive the rating below this threshold can increase the interest rate sharply, and for a long time. Yet, simulation studies based on our estimations show that it is highly improbable that rating agencies can be made responsible for the most dramatic spikes in interest rates.

We conjecture that the government censors negative news and promotes positive news in Chinese media, leading to the premium on A-shares, which are mainly traded by domestic investors. We find that the ratio of positive to negative news is substantially higher for Chinese newspapers than English news-papers. Such favouritism is found to inflate the price of domestic A-shares and contribute to the discount of foreign B-shares from the same firms. We also provide evidence that B-share investors pay more attention to bad news, while A-share investors pay more attention to good news. Our findings suggest that the news perception distorted by media censorship helps to explain the foreign share discount puzzle and has important implications for international capital flows.

Simple mean value comparisons reveal no statistically significant differences in fertilizer and pesticide expenditures between off-farm work participants and nonparticipants. However, econometric estimation with a treatment effects model shows a negative selection bias. After controlling for this bias, the empirical results show that participation in off-farm work exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on fertilizer and pesticide expenditures. Our findings generally suggest that the income effect of off-farm work stimulates agricultural production by increasing investments in productivity-enhancing inputs.","[Ma, Wanglin] Lincoln Univ, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Ma, Chunbo] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chunbo] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Kiel; Jinan University; University of Western Australia,"Ma, WL (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",wanglin.ma@lincoln.ac.nz,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,40,67,71,14,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

These expectations might then in turn shape individuals' investment behaviors, potentially affecting their incomes in subsequent years. As part of an emerging literature on endogenous preferences, economists have begun studying the consequences that exposure to natural disasters have on risk attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. We add to this field by studying the impact of being struck by the December 2012 Cyclone Evan on Fijian households' risk attitudes and subjective expectations about the likelihood and severity of natural disasters over the next 20 years. The randomness of the cyclone's path allows us to estimate the causal effects of exposure on both risk attitudes and risk perceptions. Our results show that being struck by an extreme event substantially changes individuals' risk perceptions as well as their beliefs about the frequency and magnitude of future shocks. However, we find sharply distinct results for the two ethnicities in our sample, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; the impact of the natural disaster aligns with previous results in the literature on risk attitudes and risk perceptions for Indo-Fijians, whereas they have little to no impact on those same measures for indigenous Fijians.

OECD nations are the source of most of the World's Foreign Direct Investment and China has the second highest number of signed Bilateral Investment Treaties. It would be interesting to analyze the effect of heterogeneous BIT on China's Inward Foreign Direct Investment. We empirically study the effect of heterogeneous BIT on Foreign Direct Investment by analyzing the data from the year 2000 to 2016. The empirical result suggests no significant correlation between heterogeneous BIT and China's Inward Foreign Direct Investment.

Therefore, it is commonly believed that stock markets are expected to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions. However, it is not known whether these stock markets can contribute to more or less CO2 emissions. Hence, the goal of this study is to examine the impact of stock market indicators on CO2 emissions across a global panel of both developed and emerging market economies. The results establish that stock market indicators have a significant negative and positive impact on carbon emissions in developed and emerging market economies, respectively. Furthermore, the findings illustrate the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, implying that stronger stock markets lead to a further decline in carbon emissions. Given these findings, the study argues that the role of stock markets in the abatement of CO2 emissions significantly varies across both developed and emerging market economies. Significant implications have to do with the fact that developed markets might have initiated effective policies on listed firms to minimize carbon emissions, while emerging markets are yet to achieve this.

The results of numerical simulation show that the higher rate of economic growth is with the lower rate of pooling account payment and the higher rate of personal account payment.

National governments are building many of these roads, which are often perceived as disenfranchising Indigenous communities. Yet in the Canadian Arctic's Mackenzie Delta, a joint venture between two Indigenous-owned construction and transportation companies built the first public highway in North America to the Arctic Ocean, which opened in November 2017. This research, based on qualitative fieldwork in the lnuvialuit Settlement Region where the highway was constructed, challenges ideas that roads are invariably top-down initiatives which negatively impact Indigenous peoples and their lands. Inuvialuit community leaders lobbied for this road project and succeeded in winning CAD $299 million in government funding to construct the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway. They leveraged opportunities afforded by land claims treaties and shifting geopolitics in the warming Arctic, which turned their region into a frontier of renewed national and global interest, to accumulate funding. Strategically, they discursively rescaled a road they sought to promote economic development and improve local mobility between two communities into a highway of national importance. This study thus extends work on tribal capitalism to explore the place-based dynamics of Indigenous political economies. It unpacks the scale oriented strategies Indigenous peoples use to advocate for new roads and increased connectivity, finding that these discourses and practices can complement the state's promotion of nation-building and market capitalism in frontier spaces. This research also suggests that more attention is required to the circumstances in which Indigenous peoples initiate or become partners in infrastructure development rather than examining only instances of resistance.

Using peer firms' idiosyncratic returns as an exogenous peer performance measure and the instrumental variable approach, we find that higher peer performance leads to higher discretionary accruals. This effect is salient for both industry leaders and followers and is robust to alternative discretionary accrual measures and alternative peer definitions. We examine two mechanisms through which peer performance affects firms' earnings management. We find that analysts revise their earnings forecasts according to peer performance and that when peer performance is higher, firms are less likely to meet or beat analyst consensus without managing earnings. This evidence suggests a capital market pressure mechanism. In addition, the effect of peer performance is more pronounced in firms using relative performance evaluation, suggesting a compensation pressure mechanism. In sum, our evidence suggests that managers report opportunistically to match peer performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our novel approach is simple and yet flexible enough to accommodate the nature and extent of information spillover among several components of the global housing network. For a network of nine leading industrial economies, we unveil static and time-varying information spillover of REIT returns using total transfer entropy, pairwise net transfer entropy and directional (From, To) transfer entropy. Evidence suggests that the greatest pairwise transfer entropy is from the US to Australia, whereas France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Singapore are the largest information recipients in the network. The time-varying evolution of total transfer entropy also exhibits a declining trend for the integration of global housing market during our sample period.","[Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Marfatia, Hardik] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, BBH 344G,5500 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Pretoria","Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",jqwxnjq@casipm.ac.cn,"Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021; Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020","Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774152, 91546109]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7X0231505]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"The first author acknowledged the supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71774152, No. 91546109 and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant: Y7X0231505).

This teaching case provides an example of implementing the sustainable leather initiative in the global sourcing process at IKEA. The case demonstrates IKEA's sustainable leather initiative supported by its tailored GS strategy and GS structure and provides a benchmark of Sustainable GS for multinational companies and allows for a thorough discussion of how to implement a sustainability initiative while conducting GS.

This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002-2013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong's three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.","[Murakami, Jin] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, 6-F Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Yiming] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, 5-F Knowles Bldg,Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Murakami, J (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, 6-F Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jin.m@cityu.edu.hk; yiminghe@hku.hk,"Murakami, Jin/AGT-2583-2022; Murakami, Jin/L-1622-2019","Murakami, Jin/0000-0002-9119-6453; He, Yiming/0000-0001-7742-3923","City University of Hong Kong [7200340, 7004634]",City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The work described in this paper was partially supported by two grants from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7200340 Megaprojects and Value Capture Opportunities under the Public Landholding System: Project Cases and Spatial Database Development and Project No. 7004634 Influences of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) with World-class Infrastructure on Business Agglomeration and Productivity in Hong Kong: A Panel Data Analysis, 2004-2014).",,84,6,6,1,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This economic relationship, which we termed 'Chimerica' in 2007, seemed likely to end as a result of the global financial crisis. Yet this did not happen. In this paper, we examine the evolution of Chimerica in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and explain how the stimulus policies of both the U.S. and China have contributed to its survival. We show how stimulus policies helped change Chimerica from a marriage of opposites to a marriage of equals. We then explain why this marriage is now destined for strife, in the form of a trade war between the U.S. and China. The consequences of such a trade war would deeply impact the global economy. We believe constructive negotiations on trade rebalancing and policy coordination are therefore needed to avoid a disruptive end to Chimerica.","[Ferguson, Niall] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Xiang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",seanxuxiang@126.com,,"Xu, Xiang/0000-0003-2566-5933",,,,,11,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The EVaR downside risk is more sensitive to the magnitude of portfolio losses compared to the quantile-based value at risk (QVaR). Rather than fitting the expectile models over ad-hoc fixed data windows, this study focuses on parameter instability of tail risk dynamics by utilizing a local parametric approach. Our framework yields a data-driven optimal interval length at each time point by a sequential test. Empirical evidence at three stock markets from 2005-2016 shows that the selected lengths account for approximately 4-6 months of daily observations. This method performs favourable compared to the models with one-year fixed intervals, as well as quantile based candidates while employing a time invariant portfolio protection (TIPP) strategy for the DAX, FTSE 100 and S&P 500 portfolios. The tail risk measure implied by our model finally provides valuable insights for asset allocation and portfolio insurance.","[Xu, Xiu] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mihoci, Andrija] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Choir Econ Stat & Econometr, Cottbus, Germany; [Haerdle, Wolfgang Karl] Humboldt Univ, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair Stat, Berlin, Germany",Soochow University - China; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiu.xu@hu-berlin.de; Andrija.Mihoci@b-tu.de; haerdle@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,"Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013","Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CRC 649]; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin [IRTG 1792],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin,The authors gratefully acknowledge the insightful and valuable comments and suggestions received from the editor and the anonymous referees.

Using a Cournot duopoly setup, we investigate the effects of centralised and decentralised labour unions on product innovation. We show that if the products are symmetrically differentiated, the incentive for innovation is higher under decentralised labour unions, whereas the innovation incentive can be higher under a centralised labour union if the products are asymmetrically differentiated. Our results show that social welfare is strictly higher under decentralised unions compared to a centralised union.","[Basak, Debasmita; Mulcherjee, Arijit] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Mulcherjee, Arijit] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Mulcherjee, Arijit] INFER, Cologne, Germany; [Mulcherjee, Arijit] City Univ Hong Kong, GRU, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; City University of Hong Kong,"Basak, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",debasmita.basak@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Basak, Debasmita/0000-0002-7128-5184",,,,,44,6,7,3,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The relation between IVOL and alpha is positive among underpriced stocks but negative and stronger among overpriced stocks (Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan, 2015). That stronger negative relation combines with the positive IVOL-beta correlation to produce the beta anomaly. The anomaly is significant only within overpriced stocks and only in periods when the beta-IVOL correlation and the likelihood of overpricing are simultaneously high. Either controlling for IVOL or simply excluding overpriced stocks with high IVOL renders the beta anomaly insignificant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Insights from a Semiparametric Approach to Modeling Firm Performance,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; LABOR; REGRESSION; PRODUCTIVITY; MARKET; UNEMPLOYMENT; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; CHINA,"There is a large and growing literature on the impact of institutional quality on economic performance and the broad consensus is that good institutions facilitate better economic performance. The literature that provides micro-level support for the policy discourse about institutional quality does not, however, account for significant intra-country variation in reactions of firms to changes in business environments, even within the same industry, and it generally ignores the possibility that the impact of institutional quality on firm performance may not be neutral. In this paper, we analyze the impact of institutions on firm performance using an approach that enables us to overcome these problems with the stylized approach. Using cross-country firm-level data, we demonstrate that not only does the marginal impact of institutional quality vary significantly within countries, but also that the impact is economically significant only at the two extremes of the distribution. We view this as prima facie evidence that policies that tinker with institutional quality on the basis of the popular wisdom about the impact of these institutions on the average firm may not have the desired or expected impact, at least at the micro level.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] Inst Labor Econ, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Dimova, Ralitza] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY USA; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Sheffield; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Manchester; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Shanghai University,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.k.bhaumik@sheffield.ac.uk,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; Bhaumik, Sumon/0000-0002-4459-3659",,,,,44,13,13,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

As a consequence, it is estimated that more than 60 million children in rural China are left behind and live with relatives, typically their paternal grandparents. These children are called Left Behind Children (LBCs). There are concerns about the potential negative effects of parental migration on the academic performance of the LBCs that could be due to the absence of parental care. However, it might also be that when a child's parents work away from home, their remittances can increase the household's income and provide more resources and that this can lead to better academic performance. Hence, the net impact of out-migration on the academic performance of LBCs is unclear. This paper examines changes in academic performance before and after the parents of students out-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 13,000 students at 130 rural primary schools in ethnic minority areas of rural China. Using difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental migration has significant, positive impacts on the academic performance of LBCs (which we measure using standardised English test scores). Heterogeneous analysis using our data demonstrates that the positive impact on LBCs is greater for poorer performing students.","[Bai, Yu; Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, CEEE, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; Stanford University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Bai, Yu/AAO-2988-2020; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Bai, Yu/0000-0002-6052-7766;","Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012, 71473240]; 111 Project [B16031]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012,71473240]; and 111 Project [B16031].",,50,53,59,11,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The results are consistent with the view that when banking crises block the normal bank-lending channel, greater social trust facilitates access to informal finance, cushioning the effects of these crises on corporate profits and employment.","[Levine, Ross] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Milken Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levine, Ross] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lin, Chen] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Wensi] CUHK, Business Sch, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Levine, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Milken Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Levine, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rosslevine@berkeley.edu; chenlin1@hku.hk; wensixie@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,43,100,101,22,127,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Economic theory delivers important guidance for long-run investment opportunities. Specifically, incorporating prior information from the habit formation or prospect theory models reinforces beliefs in mean reversion and inferences that stocks are safer over longer horizons. Conversely, investors with long-run risk priors perceive weaker mean reversion and riskier equities. Model-based information is particularly important for inferences about uncertainty in the dividend growth component of returns.","[Avramov, Doron] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Avramov, Doron] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cederburg, Scott] Univ Arizona, McClelland Hall 315R, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lucivjanska, Katarina] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Arizona; University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Cederburg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, McClelland Hall 315R, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",cederburg@email.arizona.edu,,"Cederburg, Scott/0000-0002-2568-0378",Israel Science Foundation [233/14]; Slovak Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA grant) [1/0344/14]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0357]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Slovak Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA grant); Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We thank Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh (the editor), two anonymous referees, John Cochrane, Thomas Dangl, Anisha Ghosh, Stefano Giglio, Gregor Kastner, Chris Lamoureux, Michael O'Doherty, Lubos Pastor, Rick Sias, and participants at the Eastern Finance Association Meeting, the European Finance Association Meeting, the Northern Finance Association Meeting, the Slovak Economic Association Meeting, and the Workshop on Asset Allocation under Parameter Uncertainty for helpful comments.

In the past two decades, the VaR and ES have been widely introduced and discussed. However, in a recent consultative document, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision suggests replacing Value-at-Risk (VaR) by expected shortfall (ES) for setting capital requirements for banks' trading books because ES better captures tail risk than VaR. However, besides ES, another risk measure called median shortfall (MS) also captures tail risk by taking into account both the size and likelihood of losses. The study argues that MS is a better alternative than ES as a risk measure for setting capital requirements in China because: (1) MS is elicitable but ES is not; (2) MS has distributional robustness with respect to model misspecification but ES does not; (3) MS is easy to implement but ES is not. In this paper, properties of VaR, MS and ES (e.g. elicitability, robustness and sub-additivity) are critically compared. Together with comparison of properties, backdatings are used to give reference of accuracy. By the approach of backtesting (traffic light) of MS and VaR, we could see many similarities but differences from ES in the paper. This paper adopts the test statistics Z2 for ES backtesting. This study aims to study high-volatile periods of Chinese stock market and use conditional EVT which can capture tail risks incisively as an indicator to estimate VaR, MS and ES. Also, this study seeks to suggest a more suitable risk measure and management system for Chinese stock market especially in a high-risk period in line with the properties and accuracy.","[Liu, Feitong] UIC 2000 Jintong Rd, Xiangzhou Dist, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",,"Liu, FT (通讯作者)，UIC 2000 Jintong Rd, Xiangzhou Dist, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",liu_feitong@yeah.net,"wang, xueting/JPY-2782-2023",,,,,,17,1,1,1,8,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,6,12,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.06.12,http://dx.doi.org/10.26480/icefs.01.2018.06.12,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000454212200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Also, education is more liable to impact dietary practices and nutrition through improvements in health knowledge, literacy, wealth and prenatal care utilisation.

Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds. The political economy of disaster must be taken into account so that projects can maximize their efficacy and avoid marginalizing those most vulnerable to those very disasters.

This earthquake caused great damage to the port of Kobe, resulting in a diversion of its container traffic to the nearby port of Busan, which increased markedly after this windfall. The strengthened economies of transport density therefore allowed Busan to expand its hinterland to regions whose container shipping operations had not even been directly affected by the earthquake, such as eastern Japan. The empirical evidence from the port choice dynamics in eastern Japan supports this mechanism. Substantial diversions of container traffic occurred after 1995 from the major ports in this region to the port of Busan. Furthermore, these unintended container shipping diversions led to a structural change in the manufacturing sector of related regions after the late 1990s.","[Xu, Hangtian] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Itoh, Hidekazu] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Hunan University; Kwansei Gakuin University,"Xu, HT (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hangtianxu@hnu.edu.cn; hito@kwansei.ac.jp,,"ITOH, Hidekazu/0000-0002-0170-0872; Xu, Hangtian/0000-0002-0178-9213",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703034]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP14J04705]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K03684]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03684] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors would like to thank the editor Nathaniel Baum-Snow and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Introducing reputational effects eliminates defaults and results in a unique but still indeterminate steady state.

Constraining forestland to its current boundaries and constraining management to current levels reduce average sequestration by 25 to 28 Tg C y(-1).

Recently, however, China has experienced a labor shortage and rising wages, implying that the country's long-lasting competitive advantage based on its unlimited labor supply and low costs is vanishing. We find that structural demographic changes, regional economic growth disparities and the household registration system may have caused the labor shortage. Furthermore, China's continued low wages, relatively low labor share of gross national income, declining proportion of household consumption to GDP, and productivity improvements as well as increasing unit labor costs can be used to explain the recent wage increases. The dramatic development of its labor market signals that China is entering a new stage of economic development. The country's prior successful model of economic development needs to be adjusted to adapt to the new situation in its labor market to achieve sustainable economic development.","[Cui, Yuming] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Lu, Changrong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Meng, Jingjing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Lu, CR (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",narcissu1113@hotmail.com,"Meng, Jingjing/J-8756-2014","Cui, Yuming/0000-0002-3314-5842; LU, CHANGRONG/0000-0002-2351-3672",Bank of Italy; Bank of Finland,Bank of Italy; Bank of Finland,We thank managing editor Andy McKay for very helpful comments and suggestions.

We argue that the patterns of interaction between urbanization and investment in real estate vary across regions. The results show that urbanization does Granger-cause investment in real estate, primarily in the central and northeastern regions of China, while urbanization does not Granger-cause investment in real estate in the eastern and western regions, except for four provinces. Most regions do not have a Granger-causality relationship from real estate investment to urbanization; the exceptions are Henan and Hei Longjiang provinces. Our results only support one theory on the relationship between urbanization and the real estate market for one-third of the provinces. Thus, urbanization can improve real estate investment by increasing the demand for housing as a result of population agglomeration, but urbanization does not depend on real estate investment in China.","[Liu, Tie-Ying] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chu, Chien-Chi] Shantou Univ Business Sch, Dept Finance, 243 Da Xue Rd, Shantou City 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chien-Chi] Shantou Univ, Res Inst Guangdong Taiwan Business Cooperat, Shantou, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Ocean University of China; Shantou University,"Chu, CC (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ Business Sch, Dept Finance, 243 Da Xue Rd, Shantou City 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jqzhu@stu.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Su, Chi Wei/0000-0001-9722-8105","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund [16YJC790064]","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund, Grant/Award Number: 16YJC790064",,46,15,16,4,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, the empirical results suggest that the rating scales used by Chinese CRAs are not comparable to those of international CRAs. Furthermore, Chinese CRAs have very broad rating scales and pool bonds with significantly different default risks into a single rating category, resulting in over 90% of bonds in only three rating categories.

The empirical relevance of this result has been challenged by many studies. In this paper, we show that such extrinsic instability associated with a balanced-budget rule is a robust phenomenon in a similar closed-economy setting enhanced with endogenous capital utilization. This suggests that the design or operation of a balanced-budget fiscal policy should recognize that it may constitute a potential source of self-fulfilling prophecies and belief-driven fluctuations.","[Huang, Kevin X.

To account for endogeneity of air pollution in the determination of wages and property prices, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in air quality induced by a policy subsidizing coal-based winter heating in northern China, and document a discontinuity in average air quality for cities located north and south of the policy boundary. Using data for all 288 Chinese cities in 2011, we estimate an equilibrium relationship between wages and house prices for the entire system of Chinese cities, and specify a regression discontinuity design to quantify how variation in air quality induced by the policy affects this relationship locally. Our preferred estimates of the elasticity of wages and house prices with respect to concentration are 0.53 and 0.71 respectively. At the average of our sample, the willingness to pay for a unit reduction in concentration is CNY 261.28 (USD 40.50), with a significant share reflected in labor market outcomes.","[Huang, Xuan] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lanz, Bruno] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",Peking University; University of Neuchatel,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@unine.ch,,,,,,,52,17,19,2,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We also show that the excess burden of taxation can increase the welfare, but ex-ante taxation always yields higher welfare than ex-post taxation.

Before the reform, SOE workers enjoyed similar job security as government employees. The reform caused massive SOE layoffs, but government employees kept their iron rice bowl. The changes in the relative unemployment risks for SOE workers provide a clean identification of income uncertainty. With self-selection biases mitigated by focusing on government assigned jobs, precautionary savings account for about 40 percent of SOE households' wealth accumulation. Moreover, demographic groups more vulnerable to the reform also accumulated more precautionary wealth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Research on dynamic information visualization design can be conducted through the diversity of techniques of expression, the innovation and uniqueness of visualization effect. Because of the huge number of information contained in information visualization, it is necessary to collect and integrate information reasonably. In other words, the necessity is the dynamic, real-time, accuracy, effectiveness and hierarchical relationship of information when designing dynamic information visualization. This paper introduces the distinctive advantage of dynamic information visualization which is obtained by the comparison with traditional media when spreading information in the new media age. Meanwhile, the paper points out that the visualization of information is realized by using more abundant and perfect information language and expression forms, which makes the spread of information more convenient, efficient and humanized, showing the advantages of new media when designing dynamic information visualization.","[Zeng, Xiaoxiao; Xiao, Ran; Chen, Jing; Wang, Yue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zeng, XX (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",125734775@qq.com,"Xiao, Ran/IYJ-1733-2023; Xiao, Ran/AAN-5293-2020","Xiao, Ran/0000-0002-3689-1680",,,,,15,1,1,1,11,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,37,42,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.37.42,http://dx.doi.org/10.26480/icefs.01.2018.37.42,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000454212200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fill this gap, this study proposes location-based space-time accessibility measures to capture the temporal variation of location-based accessibility. Using the space-time utility perspective, the accessibility of a location is conceptualized as the space-time utility offered by a set of facilities accessible from the location. Individuals' facility choice behaviors among multiple alternatives are explicitly considered. A time dependent facility attractiveness function is introduced to represent the temporal variation of individuals' needs to perform activities at a certain facility. The introduced function is formulated as two components: a time invariant component representing individual satisfactions derived from activity participation at the facility, and a time-varying component expressing individuals' dynamic intensities to perform a certain type of activities at different times of day. To demonstrate the applicability of these proposed measures, a comprehensive case study has been carried out in Wuhan, China. The results of the case study show that the proposed measures can well capture the temporal variation of accessibility, due to the dynamics both of traffic conditions and of individuals' intensities in performing activities at different times of day. The proposed measures require moderate level of data, in terms of rich facility information; and most of these data could be extracted from social media applications.","[Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Yuan, Hui] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Yuan, Hui] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Donggen] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Lam, William H.

The return predictive power of innovative originality is stronger for firms with higher valuation uncertainty, lower investor attention, and greater sensitivity of future profitability to innovative originality.

Using the 2013 origin/destination (O/D) passenger flow data instead of commonly used scheduled data, we compare the spatial configurations of the Chinese national urban system in both high-speed railway and airline networks. The results show that HSR-dominant cities and links are located mainly in the middle and eastern parts of China, offering regional connections, whereas air-dominant cities and links are evenly distributed across the whole of China and predominantly offer interregional connections. This is mainly because HSR networks are more focused on connections to cities with high socio-economic performance and are more restricted by the geographical distance between linked cities than the airline networks. Furthermore, HSR networks promote agglomeration economies within cities located along the trunk lines in specific regions, whereas airline networks contribute to more balanced urban development in China. These dimensions indicate that the configuration of urban systems in HSR networks differ largely from that of air networks when measured in terms of passenger flows.","[Yang, Haoran; Dijst, Martin; Witte, Patrick] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dobruszkes, Frederic] ULB, DGES IGEAT, Fac Sci Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Yang, Haoran; Wang, Jiaoe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiaoe] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dijst, Martin] LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg","Utrecht University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, JE (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangje@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021; Yang, Haoran/GXH-6567-2022; Wang, Jiaoe/AAD-5237-2020","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455; Yang, Haoran/0000-0001-5572-9390; Wang, jiaoe/0000-0003-1051-7727",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41722103],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),All the authors gratefully thank the reviewers and editors their insightful and constructive comments.

Using two approaches - consolidating the minority owned affiliates with the parent or deducting equity investments in minority ownership from the parent's capital - we find that the effective capitalization ratios of small US bank holding companies (BHCs) are substantially lower than the reported ratios. Empirical evidence suggests that the effectively lower capitalization ratios are associated with higher riskiness at the BHC level. Capital adjustments following pro forma consolidation better capture the additional risks than capital adjustments in the form of equity deductions for investments in minority-owned affiliates. These findings have important implications for the regulation of bank capital. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Reallocation of innovative resources, redeployment of human capital, and change to board-level expertise all contribute to improve target firms' innovation.

We find that a long-run equilibrium relationship among the cross-listed share prices exists, but find no evidence of long-run co-movements among different shares traded in the same exchange. Furthermore, the VAR Granger causality tests indicate bidirectional feedback relations among the returns of cross-listed shares, while there is no consistent causality among different stocks within the markets. We also find that the cross-listed shares demonstrate strong volatility spillovers, which is driven by the covariance structure that is formed by variance and correlation terms. In addition, we report liquidity spillover effects and spillovers running from liquidity to volatility for some firms but no evidence that spillover effects run from volatility to liquidity.

This article aims to evaluate the overall effects of multi-dimensional interstate competitions on agricultural production, which is achieved using spatial production functions and model averaging methods. Using panel data, this article finds that interstate agricultural competition ought to be encouraged in the United States due to their positive impacts on spillovers and productivity but should be discouraged in China as it leads to negative spillovers and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, intrastate competition increases productivity in the United States but conversely decreases productivity in China. Other major drivers of productivity growth in the two countries are also found to vary, which provides evidence of a centrally planned system in China compared with the market system in the United States. U.S. agriculture enjoys the benefits of competition thanks to agricultural industrialization and a competitive market, while the planned system with government interference found in China has benefits as well as detriments. Food policy implications are also discussed.","[Gong, Binlei] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gong, BL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev CARD, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Room 1203,Qizhen Bldg,866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gongbinlei@zju.edu.cn,,"Gong, Binlei/0000-0002-0615-9341",Research Program for Humanities and Social Science - Chinese Ministry of Education [18YJC790034]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [526013*172220182]; Teaching and Research Development Program for Faculties in Arts and Humanities at Zhejiang University [126000-541903/026],Research Program for Humanities and Social Science - Chinese Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Teaching and Research Development Program for Faculties in Arts and Humanities at Zhejiang University,"I thank Dr. Holly Wang for the ZJU-Purdue Summer Camp and Dr. Jikun Huang for his lecture, both of which provide me ideas to explain the empirical findings of this paper.

The results show that the principal driver of a switching action is the credit needs of the firm. The binding force of the Communist Party in state-owned banks and enterprises would suggest that switching should be a rare phenomenon in Chinese commercial relations. But switching occurs. The findings support the extant literature that transparent firms are able to switch more readily than opaque firms. The results also suggest that banks that develop their fee income services are more effective in locking-in their borrowers and that firms tend to switch from state-owned banks to smaller non-state owned banks. However, in other areas switching does not conform with the mainstream explanations.","[Yin, Wei] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dongnandaxue Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Matthews, Kent] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Matthews, Kent] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Cardiff University; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yin, W (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dongnandaxue Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yinwei_seu@126.com,"Matthews, Kent/AAE-5927-2020","Matthews, Kent/0000-0001-6968-3098; Yin, Wei/0000-0003-0432-4355",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503041]; open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering [NSK2015-18],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71503041) and the open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering (NSK2015-18).,,40,8,8,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper focuses on developing a fast and simplified approach to computing IV egalitarian Shapley values for such a rather large subclass of IV cooperative games. In this method, through adding some weaker coalition monotonicity-like conditions, it is proven that egalitarian Shapley value is monotonic and non-decreasing. Hence, the IV egalitarian Shapley value of IV cooperative games can be directly obtained by determining its lower and upper bounds, respectively. The method proposed in this paper does not use the Moore's interval subtraction and hereby can effectively avoid the issues resulted from it. Furthermore, some important properties of the IV egalitarian Shapley values of IV cooperative games are discussed.

The experiments were conducted both in the field with TURF users and in the lab with university students. Our study has two objectives. First, we designed our experiments to study the effects of poaching on the ability of common pool resource users to coordinate their harvests when encroachment by outsiders is unrestricted and when the government provides weak enforcement. Second, we examine the ability of common pool resource users to simultaneously coordinate their harvests and investments in monitoring to deter poaching with and without government assistance in monitoring. Weak external monitoring that was predicted to have no effect actually led to significantly lower poaching relative to unrestricted poaching. However, neither giving sole responsibility for monitoring to resource users nor combining user and government monitoring affected poaching levels much. Our results suggest that users of a common pool resource may have difficulties coordinating their efforts to deter poachers, even with help from government authorities. We find no important qualitative differences in the behavior of TURF users and university students. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We use game theory model to prove the existence of motivation to adopt positive portfolio strategy generated from fund family. We then use the empirical data from 2006 to 2015 to test the impact of positive portfolio strategy on funds' performance, using deviation of the fund from family portfolio to agent the index for measuring the positivity of the fund management.

Further analysis reveals a sharp gender division in patterns of family care in China. While men are more likely to receive care from their wives, women are primarily cared for by their children. Marital status and spouse health also affect provision of care, with infirm women who have healthy husbands less likely to receive care than infirm men with healthy wives.

To understand the origin of technological progress, we need a model of endogenous technological change. The Romer model fills this important gap in the literature. However, given its complexity, undergraduate students often find the Romer model difficult. This paper proposes a simple method of teaching the Romer model. We add three layers of structure (one at a time) to extend the familiar Solow model into the less familiar Romer model. First, we incorporate a competitive market structure into the Solow model. Then, we modify the competitive market structure into a monopolistic market structure. Finally, we introduce an R&D sector that invents new products.","[Chu, Angus C.] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Chu, AC (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",angusccc@fudan.edu.cn,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,11,6,6,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

A federation, with the aim of maximizing the aggregate utility of its members, may find it advantageous to decentralize the decision-making, so that its members act autonomously to maximize their own utility. If utility is fully transferable within a federation, the larger a federation is or the more sensitive it is to the public good, the more it has incentives to remain centralized. If an overall increase in the sensitivity to the public good induces some fed-eration(s) to decentralize, it may lead to a decrease in the aggregate provision. With non-transferable utility within a federation, those members that are smaller or less sensitive to the public good are more likely to prefer decentralization.

While many studies have investigated the relationship between violence against children and health of the victims, little is known about the long term economic consequences of child maltreatment, especially in developing countries. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Study, this paper applies Heckman selection models to investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and young adults' wages in South Africa. The results show that, on average, any experience of physical or emotional abuse during childhood is associated with a later 12% loss of young adults' wages. In addition, the correlation between physical abuse and economic consequence (14%) is more significant than the relationship between emotional abuse and wages (8%) of young adults; and the higher the frequency of maltreatment, the greater the associations with wages. With respect to gender differences, wage loss due to the experience of childhood maltreatment is larger for females than males. Specifically, males' wages are more sensitive to childhood emotional abuse, while females' wages are more likely to be affected by childhood physical abuse. These results emphasize the importance of prioritizing investments in prevention and intervention programs to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment and to help victims better overcome the long-term negative effect.","[Zheng, Xiaodong; Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xiangming] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Fry, Deborah A.; Casey, Tabitha] Univ Edinburgh, Moray House Sch Educ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ganz, Gary; Ward, Catherine L.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Psychol, Cape Town, South Africa; [Hsiao, Celia] Save Children South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa",China Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Edinburgh; University of Cape Town; Save the Children,"Fang, XM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Fang, XM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",xmfang@cau.edu.cn,"Fang, Xiangming/B-8650-2014; Ward, Catherine L./ACR-5809-2022; Fang, Xiangming/O-1653-2014","Ward, Catherine L./0000-0001-8727-4175; Fang, Xiangming/0000-0001-9922-8977",,,,,64,4,6,0,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

However, the portfolio optimization selection is complex NP-complete problem. To address the portfolio optimization problem, a hybrid swarm intelligent optimization approach that combines harmony search (HS) and teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is presented in this work. We introduce a Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV) model which incorporates the boundary constraints (such as the bound of portfolio selection proportion of each asset and the number of assets) and considers transaction costs. To enhance the global optimization performance, an improved HS and modified TLBO are synergistically performed using a dynamic selection strategy for balancing the global exploration power and the local exploitation power. The experimental results on five data sets (HangSeng, DAX 100, FTSE 100, S&P 100, and Nikkei 225) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient in solving complex portfolio selection problems.","[Tuo, Shouheng] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Hong] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications; Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Tuo, SH (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tuo_sh@l26.com; hehongtbw@126.com,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The analysis applies a policy-based identification strategy to control for the endogenous relationship between paid leave entitlements and breastfeeding decisions. Estimates show that paid maternity leave has a strong positive effect on breastfeeding duration. Specifically, if the length of paid leave increases by thirty days, then the probability of breastfeeding for at least six months increases by 12 percentage points. Between 1988 and 2008, the average length of paid leave for mothers without a college education decreased by twenty-three days, which reduced these mothers' probability of breastfeeding for at least six months by 9 percentage points. These results support the view that paid maternity leave enhances the ability of employed women to sustain breastfeeding and call for universal paid leave entitlements.","[Jia, Nan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Econ, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Song, Yue-ping] Renmin Univ China, Sociol & Populat Studies, 59 Zhongguancun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Winnipeg; Renmin University of China,"Jia, N (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Econ, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",jianancandy@swufe.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; songyueping@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303189]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada,The work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Center of Canada (Project no. 107579) and a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71303189).,,28,26,28,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Both labor- and capital-intensive firms exhibit sensitivity to high temperatures. By mid 21st century, if no additional adaptation were to occur, we project that climate change will reduce Chinese manufacturing output annually by 12%, equivalent to a loss of $39.5 billion in 2007 dollars.

However, due to the intrinsic complexity and non-stationary of SPI, accurate SPI prediction has been a challenge task for a longtime. Compared to a quantity of single algorithms, hybrid methods always have higher prediction accuracy. Based on the theories of genetic algorithm (GA), grey model (GM), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector regression (SVR), in this paper, two hybrid models named GA-SVR-GM and GABPNN-GM are proposed for improving the prediction accuracy of Composite Index in Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and Component Index in Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The SVR (or BPNN) is first used to forecast SPI and then with the obtained errors GM is constructed taking into account the different patterns that the SVR (or BPNN) cannot identify, reducing with the final errors. Moreover, in order to obtain the better forecasting results of SVR (or BPNN), the model parameters are optimized by GA. Two prediction cases of SPI are used to test the performance of the proposed hybrid models. Compared with the random walk (RW), SVR, and BPNN, the simulation results show that the GA-SVR-GM and GA-BPNN-GM consistently have the minimum statistical error of the root mean square error (RAISE), mean absolute error (NAE), and mean absolute percentage error (NAPE). Thus, it can be concluded that such improving methods are effective.","[Wang, Jujie; Que, Danfeng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wjj0913@126.com; quintaqdf@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501101,11801276, 71603128, 61502242]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150928, BK20160974]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15CJL017, 18ZDA052, 16ZDA047]; Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [2015SJB063]; Qing Lan Project; Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province; Qing Lan Project(Jiangsu Polytech Institute); Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71501101,11801276, 71603128 and 61502242), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20150928 and BK20160974), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 15CJL017, 18ZDA052 and 16ZDA047), the Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 2015SJB063), the Qing Lan Project, the Project Funded by the Flagship Major Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions and the Top-notch Academic Programs Project of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,16,5,5,1,32,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

By looking at the sign of coefficients of the independent variable that we find both financial development and trade openness promote economic growth and economic growth further reduce trade openness. These empirical results have important policy implications for the government conducting both financial development and trade openness strategies to promote economic growth in China and financial development strategy is the most important one.

This study shows that disadvantages in the labor market for women are the primary drivers of the gender pension gap.

Using the 2013 wave of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and the CHARLS Life History Survey of 2014, this contribution has three main findings. First, about three-quarters of the deficit in women's pensions is explained by women's lower likelihood of receiving occupational pensions, and one-third is due to smaller benefits when they do receive them. Second, the gender deficit in receiving an occupational pension can be explained by education level and employment sector. Third, among pension recipients, nearly one-third of the gender benefit gap is explained by women's fewer years of employment and lower salaries.","[Zhao, Rui] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, 301 Baosheng Ave, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Political Science & Law - China; Peking University,"Zhao, R (通讯作者)，Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, 301 Baosheng Ave, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China.",zhaoruiwhu@gmail.com; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715","Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank [RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603013, 71450001, 71704147, 71130002]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579]; National Institute on Aging [R01AG037031, R03AG049144]; China Medical Board [16-249]",Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); China Medical Board,"We acknowledge support from the International Development Research Center of Canada (107579), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71704147, 71450001, 71130002, 71603013), the Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank (RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161), the National Institute on Aging (R01AG037031, R03AG049144), and the China Medical Board (16-249).

This article focuses on how social relations are reconfigured and subsumed in the capital accumulation process in the realm of the Internet content industry, using the Chinese case. It argues that fresh graduates are subsumed into the accumulation process as immaterial resources in the circulation of capital. It also offers a general critique of the capital accumulation process, as it shifts risks and costs of failure on to independent start-ups entering the industry.","[Xia, Bingqing] East China Normal Univ, Sch Commun, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University,"Xia, BQ (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Sch Commun, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",yummexia@163.com,"Xia, Bingqing/ABB-7829-2021",,East China Normal University Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018ECNU-HWFW005]; Westminster Institute for Advanced Research's international research fellowship programme,East China Normal University Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Westminster Institute for Advanced Research's international research fellowship programme,"The research for this article was financially supported and enabled by East China Normal University Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Ref.

This paper provides new empirical evidence of pollution avoidance that Chinese urban residents purchase particulate-filtering facemasks to protect against ambient air pollution. The analysis is conducted with detailed and comprehensive data available on daily facemask purchases and air quality that became available only very recently. We find that this transitory air pollution avoidance behavior exhibits dynamics and nonlinearities, with significant increases of facemask purchases during extreme pollution episodes. The daily model shows that a 100-point increase in Air Quality Index (AQI) increases the consumption of all masks by 54.5 percent and anti-PM2.5 masks by 70.6 percent. The estimates from the aggregated model with flexible pollution levels are used to simulate the benefit of air quality improvement. If 10 percent of heavy pollution days (AQI >= 201) were eliminated, the total savings on facemasks alone would be approximately 187 million USD in China. This result suggests that reducing the occurrence of airpocalypse events represents a significant opportunity to improve social welfare. Nevertheless, our estimates are likely only a small part of the benefit of clean air because facemasks can only partially reduce the negative health effects of air pollution and the costs of other avoidance behaviors are not included.

In line with previous research, time poverty is defined as a lack of enough time for rest and leisure. Three time-poverty measures are adopted. By all three measures, women paid workers and low-paid workers account for a disproportionate share of the time poor. Regression analysis further shows that, other things being equal, workers who are women, low-paid, married, and who live with children or the elderly in counties with higher overtime rates and lower minimum wage standards are more likely to be time poor. Simulations indicate that enforcing working time regulations and raising minimum wage standards could be effective for reducing time poverty.","[Qi, Liangshu] Tsinghua Univ, Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Tsinghua University; University of Winnipeg,"Qi, LS (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qilsh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573146]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada,This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Center of Canada (Project no. 107579) and a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71573146).

Using seven different surveys, the eleven contributions in this volume study the distributive consequences of post-reform care policies and the impact of unpaid care responsibilities on women's and men's opportunities and gender inequality. Overall, reduced care services have created care deficits for disadvantaged groups, including low-income rural elderly and children. The shifted care burden has also limited women's ability to participate fully in the market economy and has contributed to rising gender inequalities in labor force participation, off-farm employment, earnings, pensions, and mental health outcomes.","[Connelly, Rachel] Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Jacobsen, Joyce] Wesleyan Univ Econ, Publ Affairs Ctr, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Winnipeg; Peking University,"Connelly, R (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",e-connelly@bowdoin.edu; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; jjacobsen@wesleyan.edu; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada [107579]; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,"The studies in this volume were performed with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada (Project no. 107579).

We propose a new risk measure (thereafter called CVaRMD) that synthesizes the mean and median deviation of the hedged portfolio loss to trace the extreme risk. The classical volatility models (GARCH-n, GARCH-t, GJR-n and GJR-t) are commonly-used in finance literature to depict the marginal distributions of the oil price and the exchange rate. Different from the time-consuming method of simulation, we employ Copula functions to deduce the cumulative distribution function of the hedged portfolio and then to calculate the extreme risk. Empirical studies demonstrate that GARCH-n and GARCH-t models are better to forecast the volatilities of Brent crude oil price and the exchange rate (CNY/USD)respectively. Frank copula better portrays the correlation structure between Brent crude oil price and the exchange rate. We find that hedging with crude oil options can reduce the extreme risk effectively. By comparing the skewness of the extreme loss under two risk measures of Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and CVaRMD, we find that the left deviation degree of the extreme loss under CVaRMD criterion is greater. The result of variance analysis further confirms this conclusion. That is to say, based on the strategy of minimizing CVaRMD, the extreme loss risk that the firm faces is relatively smaller. We further analyze the parameter sensitivities and give the firm some suggestions to choose the appropriate option contracts and decide its budget.","[Yu, Xing] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiguo; Liu, Yongjun] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; South China University of Technology,"Yu, X (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuxing@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; wgzhang@mail.scut.edu.cn; bmyjliu@mail.scut.edu.cn,,"Liu, Yong-Jun/0000-0002-1728-480X",Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71720107002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501076]; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong [2014A030310454]; Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China [2018116]; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education [16YJAZH078]; Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou,Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Fund of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education; Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou,"This paper is supported by Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71720107002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71501076), Natural Science Fund of Guangdong (No.2014A030310454), Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou, Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China(No.2018116),Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education(Grant No. 16YJAZH078).",,18,3,3,1,28,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In particular, cycling is more likely and more severely to be affected by inclement weather than the motorized modes as the cyclists are entirely exposed to outdoor environment. Understanding the weather-cycling relationship is of great importance to academics and practitioners for cycling activity analysis and promotion. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of how the changes in weather conditions affect cycling on an off-road trail and an on-road (bridge) bike lane at both daily and hourly scales across four seasons. The paper compares the weather-cycling relationship based on day of week and time of day combinations. The autocorrelation effect of cycling itself and the lagging effect of weather elements are also examined. The findings indicate that cycling is significantly self-dependent especially at the finer temporal scales. Weather have a very different influence on bicycle usage of off-road trails versus on-road bike lanes. When it rains its negative impact not only continues but also significantly affects the cycling within previous one hour. At the daily level, weekend cycling on the trail is less likely to be affected by weather as compared to cycling on the bike lane, whilst inverse is true for weekday cycling. Cycling is most likely to be affected by weather conditions in spring and least likely to be affected in winter. Cycling pattern which is more unrelated to weather at the aggregated level tends to be more flexibly adjusted according to the real-time weather conditions at the disaggregated level. Cyclists on weekends especially during the weekend peak hours (11 AM-4 PM) tend to have more flexibility to adjust their cycling schedule before or after the adverse weather conditions than on weekdays. In addition, cyclists with utilitarian purposes are more likely to shift from cycling to other modes (e.g., transit) due to real-time bad weather conditions in weekdays than in weekends, especially during weekday peak hours (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM). The results provide weather officials, transport agencies and research institutions with valuable information for cycling activity analysis and promotion by considering the effects of weather events especially rainfall.","[Zhao, Jinbao; Xing, Zhaomin] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jinbao; Luan, Xin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Purdue Univ, NEXTRANS Ctr, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 3000 Kent Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Jiang, Yang] China Sustainable Transportat Ctr, 19 Jianguomenwai Ave, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Southeast University - China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.;Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinbao@sdut.edu.cn,"Wang, Jian/U-3959-2019; Wang, Jian/HII-8685-2022","Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645; Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645","National Science Foundation of China [51608313, 51508315]; Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology [2017ZBXC015]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology,"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (51608313, 51508315) and the Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology (2017ZBXC015).

The shipping market is cyclic and uncertain, and the decision is whether to invest ships now or later. Theoretically, we found the trigger rates the necessary freight rates for profitable ship investment for both the net present value (NPV) and real option approach (ROA), assuming that future freight earnings follow a mean reverting stochastic process. The combination of these trigger rates provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for immediate investment. Empirically, we estimated the trigger rates for the whole sample from January 1976 to July 2014, as well as sub-samples that take into account structural changes in the shipping market. Both theoretical and empirical results show that ship investment decisions can be made based on the relationships between the current freight rate and the trigger rates from NPV and ROA. If the freight rate cannot make NPV positive, no investment should be considered. Immediate investment is only recommended when the freight rate is higher than the trigger rate using ROA. Sensitivity analysis shows that the trigger rate is most sensitive to changes in the long-run mean of the freight rate. A simple regression analysis indicates that our model can explain market driven ship investment activities in the past. In addition, results that incorporate structural breaks in the shipping market are closer to actual investment behavior in the market.","[Kou, Ying] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SinoUS Global Logist Inst, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Luo, Meifeng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Luo, MF (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maggiekou@sjtu.edu.cn; Meifeng.Luo@polyu.edu.hk,"Luo, Meifeng/ABB-2204-2020; Kou, Ying/M-1326-2017","Luo, Meifeng/0000-0001-5044-2737; Kou, Ying/0000-0001-5557-5686; KOU, Ying/0000-0003-0272-8655",Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund [PolyU 5463/12H]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603164]; Scientific Research Staring Fund for Young Teachers [16X100040011]; IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and RD Center,Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Staring Fund for Young Teachers; IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and RD Center,"Thanks for the support of IMC-Frank Tsao Maritime Library and R&D Center during the preparation of this paper.

These contract-free jobs pay lower hourly wages, require longer weekly work hours, and provide less insurance or on-the-job training than regular jobs with contracts. We find that the co-villager networks play an important role in a migrant's decision on whether to accept such insecure and irregular jobs. By employing a comprehensive nationwide survey in 2011 in the spatial autoregressive logit model, we show that the common behavior of not signing contracts in the co-villager network increases the probability that a migrant accepts a contract-free job. We provide three possible explanations on how networks influence migrants' contract decisions: job referral mechanism, limited information on contract benefits, and the mini-labor union formed among co-villagers, which substitutes for a formal contract. In the subsample analysis, we also find that the effects are larger for migrants whose jobs were introduced by their co-villagers, male migrants, migrants with rural Hukou, short-term migrants, and less educated migrants. The heterogeneous effects for migrants of different employer types, industries, and home provinces provide policy implications.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Deng, Ying; Ma, Xiangjun] Univ Int Business & Econ, 10 Huixin East St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; University of International Business & Economics,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.;Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu; ydeng.econ@gmail.com; xm2e@virginia.edu,"Deng, Ying/I-3480-2015","Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045, 71401038, 11671084]; Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Funding,"This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045], [71401038], [11671084] and Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158].

However, there are only a few studies on momentum profits in China. Therefore, this study examines whether the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets produce momentum profits. We find that these two markets have significant contrarian but not momentum profits. We also create an artificial momentum portfolio and follow Bhattacharya et al. (Account Rev 78:641-678, 2003) to compute the transparency indices. Our outcomes show that the corporate transparencies of the winners (losers) in the artificial momentum portfolios are close to those in the commonly-defined momentum portfolios. The averages of the decile transparencies are between 4.5 and 6.5, not only for the top 10% of winners but also for the bottom 10% of losers.

Our modeling results suggest that shipping firms' network configuration is influenced by emission charge, fuel price, port loading and unloading cost, and demand pattern of cargo transport across different markets. Total emission will be reduced by an EU emission charge scheme. However, if the charge is above a threshold, carriers will reconfigure shipping networks to minimize their costs including emission charge payments. This will offset part of the emission reduction achieved by the emission scheme. As a result, a higher charge does not always lead to a higher emission reduction. The performance of major ports along the Asia-Europe routes will be influenced in different ways, leading to conflicting views from regional governments. These findings reveal possible regulation costs and market distortions associated with regional emission systems, and highlight the complex effects of international environmental policies when market dynamics are considered.","[Dai, Wayne Lei; Hu, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaowen] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yip, Tsz Leung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Sydney; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of International Business & Economics,"Wang, K (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dailei1989@sjtu.edu.cn; xiaowen.fu@sydney.edu.au; t.l.yip@polyu.edu.hk; hhu@sjtu.edu.cn; wqueenfox@gmail.com,"WANG, KUN/HDN-4021-2022; Wang, Kun/AAE-4337-2019; Yip, Tsz Leung/B-4288-2010","WANG, KUN/0000-0002-2137-9457; Yip, Tsz Leung/0000-0002-7277-7666; Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X",,,,,43,33,37,2,46,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The so-called post-industrial trilemma is suggested to allow only two of relative earnings equality, high levels of employment and fiscal balance, and has resulted in the widespread policy belief that greater earnings inequality and welfare state retrenchment are unavoidable. This article challenges the micro foundations of this understanding, that the production of economic value is technologically determined by the physical properties inherent in goods and services. In contrast, we argue theoretically, and demonstrate empirically, that production, allocation and distribution are contingent processes better conceived in terms of power over rents' with associated externalities between sectors. Our analysis suggests that the post-industrial trilemma thesis may have unduly distracted research from the potential for redistributive politics to achieve sustainable levels of productivity growth, fiscal balance and higher levels of earnings equality.","[Lewis, Paul] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Peng, Fei] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Songjiang Qu, Shanghai Shi, Peoples R China; [Ryner, Magnus] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England",University of Birmingham; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of London; King's College London,"Lewis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",p.c.lewis@bham.ac.uk,"Lewis, Paul/ACH-8124-2022; Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019","Lewis, Paul/0000-0002-1459-3981; Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Ryner, Magnus/0000-0002-7492-2986",ESRC seminar series award [ES/M002209/1]; LSE; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC seminar series award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); LSE; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the ESRC seminar series award ES/M002209/1, 'Understanding the post-crisis landscape: assessing change in economic management, welfare, work and democracy' and the LSE hosted workshop, 'Wages in the EMU' for supporting the discussion of ideas which contributed to this paper.",,94,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Education and income are inversely related to coresiding, while higher immigrant density increases the propensity to coreside. Contextual effects reveal that neighborhoods with a relatively large Caucasian average household size increase coresidence behavior among immigrants; and the income of Caucasians living in the area is inversely related to immigrant coresiding behavior. Second-generation Asian immigrants are more likely to live independently, while second-generation Hispanic/Latino immigrants have a higher propensity to coreside; however, they are influenced contextually by geographic household and income patterns.

The EBLUP assumes normal and independent random small area effects as well as normal and independent random sampling errors. Under these assumptions, the variable of interest also follows a normal distribution. In practice, however, the above assumptions are often violated. The variable of interest is often non-normal and highly skewed, and the small areas are frequently spatially dependent. In this paper, we propose the spatial empirical Bayes predictor (SEBP) of the small area mean of a positively skewed variable of interest in the presence of spatial dependence among the random small area effects. We assume that the variable of interest follows a normal distribution after a log transformation and that its log transform is linked to some auxiliary variables by a nested error regression model. The SEBP is derived under the log-transformed nested error regression model. By way of simulation, we show that compared to its alternatives, i.e., the direct estimator which is solely based on the survey data for the small area under study, the EBLUP which does not take into account spatial dependence and skewness, the empirical Bayes predictor which takes into account skewness but not spatial dependence among the small areas, the SEBP has the smallest average relative bias and average relative root-mean-squared error for various combinations-though not all-of skewness and spatial correlation.","[Handayani, Dian] State Univ Jakarta, Dept Stat, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Handayani, Dian; Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Handayani, Dian; Kurnia, Anang; Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Stat, Bogor, Indonesia; [Folmer, Henk] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Universitas Negeri Jakarta; University of Groningen; Bogor Agricultural University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Notodiputro, KA (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Stat, Bogor, Indonesia.",dianh@unj.ac.id; h.folmer@rug.nl; anangk@apps.ipb.ac.id; khairil@apps.ipb.ac.id,"Handayani, Dian/GPC-7317-2022; Kurnia, Anang/CAE-9008-2022; Kurnia, Anang/AAG-9094-2020; Launggu, Kani/JJC-0851-2023; Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar/CAG-2604-2022","Kurnia, Anang/0000-0001-9409-2361; Kurnia, Anang/0000-0001-9409-2361; Launggu, Kani/0009-0000-7774-951X; Handayani, Dian/0000-0002-2721-1946",,,,,18,2,2,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Strong trademark protection can lower consumers' costs of searching for preferred quality characteristics. With weak trademark protection, firms in developing countries may not be willing to provide high-quality products. With strong trademark protection, firms have an incentive to maintain or improve quality over time in order not to erode the value of their trademarks. By solving the theoretical model, we show that strengthened trademark protection in developing countries may induce domestic firms to become exporters and raise the quality of products on the export market. The welfare analyses show that strengthened trademark protection in developing countries benefits Southern customers and firms producing high-quality products, but harms firms producing counterfeits and uninformed customers, if firm H charges low prices. Given firm H charges a high price, the strengthened trademark protection only helps firm H and informed customers in the South while leaves the others unaffected.","[Yang, Lei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiaopeng; He, Yin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Dept Int Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of International Business & Economics,"Yang, L (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"YANG, Lei/0000-0002-0237-5821",,,,,10,1,1,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41,11,,,,,3242,3254,,10.1111/twec.12468,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12468,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Accepted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000450129200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the theory of heterosis and existing genetic evidence, offspring of hybrid marriages (spouses originating from different states/provinces/countries/areas), though relatively rare due to physical boundaries, may exhibit greater genetic fitness in terms of intelligence, height, or physical attractiveness (the distanceperformance hypothesis). This study explores whether heterosis is a contributing factor to offspring's educational attainment in China by applying a high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE) modelling framework to the unique 0.1% micro-sample of the 2000 Chinese Population Census data. Concerning potential endogeneity of hybrid marriages, we conduct a series of robustness checks. Reassuringly, the estimated heterosis effect remains significantly positive across various measurements, after controlling for parental educational attainments/height, environmental influences, and over a thousand region and region-by-year fixed effects. The effects in male and higher-educated offspring are found to be stronger. Results are replicated when analyzing body height using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Although endogeneity of hybrid marriages may not be completely ruled out, the current study sheds light on the potentially beneficial effects of interprovincial migration on population-level human capital accumulation, and we hope that this paper can intrigue future studies that further address endogeneity. The implied heterosis effect could, therefore, be profound for Homo sapiens as a species from an evolutionary point of view. An additional important implication is that the overall genetic influences of parents on offspring's performance may be further decomposed into a conventional heredity effect and a heterosis effect that has been neglected previously.

Sustainable progress in energy efficiency achievement is beneficial to energy security and the achievement of the Paris Agreement. This article combines the stochastic frontier method with the panel Markov-switching regression to model energy efficiency transitions. The estimated energy efficiency scores show significant regional and provincial heterogeneity. Also, while human capital development, urbanization, and foreign direct investment promote energy efficiency, price and income per capita reduce it. The transition probabilities indicate that the high energy-efficient state is less sustainable, and the movement towards the frontier seems less persistent than movement from the frontier. Thus, it appears that China is not making sustainable progress in energy efficiency. The unsustainable nature of the high energy-efficient state suggests that in China, there are weak energy efficiency efforts and energy efficiency policies lack robustness.","[Zhang, Lin; Adom, Philip Kofi] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",l.zhang@cityu.edu.hk; adomonline@yahoo.co.uk,"Zhang, Lin/O-5851-2017; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/K-4651-2017","Zhang, Lin/0000-0002-5945-5451; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/0000-0001-8135-7260","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CityU 21603917]; City University of Hong Kong [7200527]","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong)","This article benefited from the useful comments of five anonymous reviewers and the editor.

These authors argue that height is a proxy for cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, which earns the positive return. In this paper, I collected data on over 2,200 English and Welsh railwaymen from staff ledgers to test if the same relationship held during the Victorian and Edwardian period. Using an OLS model, it is found that a wage-height premium existed. Applying the same model to different subgroups of railwaymen, it was found that the premium only accrued to taller men working in skilled grades that required a higher cognitive and non-cognitive skill to strength ratio. No such premium existed in the physically taxing entry-level railway grades. A probit regression finds that taller Great Western signalmen working in Wales did not have a lower probability of receiving a fine upon committing an infraction; a finding that contradicts heightism as an explanation of the wage-height premium. I conclude that taller railwaymen benefited because height indirectly measured their cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, not their strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Private enterprises make their own adaptability and matching decisions under such an objective and inevitable macroeconomic environment. At this stage, globalization has led to the economic integration to a certain extent, which has increased the volume of regional and international trade, and increased the degree of regionalization and internationalization of capital flows. For private enterprises, foreign trade is subject to both domestic and foreign political and economic factors.

The findings indicate that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among sectoral natural gas demand, sectoral income and various fuel prices. The results also indicate that most price elasticities are smaller relative to developed countries; the effect of fuel prices on natural gas demand is partly offset by the government regulation. In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, China's natural gas demand will reach 340 bcm and 528 bcm and its foreign dependence will reach 27.9% and 43.2% in 2020 and 2030, respectively.

This paper aims to understand the attitude of relevant stakeholders towards the performance of the Traditional Sea-Land Line (TSLL) alongside the two emerging container routes under the B&R initiative. To achieve this objective, we first of all built a performance evaluation system to understand the relative performance of these trade routes. A questionnaire survey was carried out to reveal the differing views on route performance, and Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was then used to examine and interpret the survey data. Secondly, by dividing the interviewees into two groups, we examined whether the government's development priorities are at variance with the preferences of industry practitioners. Thirdly, we explored the reasons for the variance by conducting an intensive interview with ten key stakeholders and then explain the findings from the perspective of institutional theories. Finally, we addressed the uncertainty and dynamics of route development under three different scenarios. Several managerial implications are proposed on the basis of our findings.","[Yang, Dong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Liping] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ng, Adolf K.

Because the Internet is developing too fast, there are no laws and regulations that impose certain restrictions and controls on internet finance. In addition to the openness of the Internet, there is also a certain risk of internet finance. Only a reasonable and effective control and management of such risks can make the Internet finance more comprehensively developed and thus improve the economic development of our country.

A considerable body of literature argues that if more freight could be carried on the rail network, substantial reductions in carbon footprints could be made. This paper describes a modelling framework for estimating the spatial transfer or movement of aggregates between quarries in England and Wales and local authority districts (demand zones). A key part of this framework is the estimation of the carbon emissions associated with both road and rail travel. Once built and calibrated, the model is used for a variety of what-if scenarios relating to the increased use of rail (which includes the necessary construction of new uplifting facilities as well as the number of rail-linked quarries) against future road haulage undertaken through a modernised vehicle fleet. The latter is shown to provide a more realistic and economic solution to reducing carbon emissions associated with the transportation of aggregates.","[Zuo, Chengchoa] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Chengchoa; Birkin, Mark; Clarke, Graham] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [McEvoy, Fiona; Bloodworth, Andrew] British Geol Survey, Nottingham NG12 5GG, England",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey,"Clarke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.p.clarke@leeds.ac.uk,"Zuo, Chengchao/AAT-8686-2021","Zuo, Chengchao/0000-0002-1419-7989; Birkin, Mark/0000-0001-5991-098X",BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662016QD019]; ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [bgs05010] Funding Source: UKRI,BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was supported by the BGS-University of Leeds joint research scholarship, and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under project 2662016QD019.",,40,17,17,9,61,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Financial turbulence is proxied by the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans in a country. Spillover effects are defined as significant changes in the linkages between countries due to a shock, and interdependence effects as strong linkages among pairs of countries independent of shocks. Using annual data of 40 countries from 2003 to 2010, we find that interdependence and spillover effects should be jointly analyzed. Furthermore, our results suggest that the capital flows channel is more important than the other two channels in capturing propagation of financial turbulence. By deriving what is known in the spatial econometrics literature as direct and indirect effect estimates, we show that the marginal effects of macroeconomic variables (like GDP growth, inflation, and credit growth) on financial turbulence take different forms during a crisis than in tranquil periods.","[Jing, Zhongbo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Elhorst, J.

This is the first study to combine the case-resampling bootstrap method with the coskewness and cokurtosis test. Thus the new method works well on data with a non-normal distribution or non-constant variance. Additional channels of contagion may also be detected to reflect a more precise pattern of contagion. In contrast to Hatemi-J and Hacker, Applied Financial Economics Letters, 1(6), 343-347 (2005)'s result, we find that the case-resampling bootstrap method diminishes the overall effect of contagion. In particular, no additional channels of contagion can be found when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the coskewness test, but when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the cokurtosis test, additional channels of contagion are detected. Furthermore, the overall effect of contagion is greater on the general equity markets than on the securitized real estate markets.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper to find strong evidence for club convergence of retail prices. These clubs emerge due to the interaction of traded and nontraded factors. For example, countries physically closer to potential trade partners converge faster than countries in the high distance regime as long as they have low initial labor productivity or low initial income. Moreover, we find an asymmetry in the extent that arbitrage opportunities related to international trade are exploited, with low initial price regime countries exhibiting faster convergence from below than high initial price regime countries exhibit from above, consistent with less resistance to exporting than to importing due to political economy considerations. We interpret our findings as evidence of a local law of one price due to barriers to price convergence influencing the duration of the effect of price shocks.","[Glushenkova, Marina] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kourtellos, Andros; Zachariadis, Marios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Cyprus,"Zachariadis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",zachariadis@ucy.ac.cy,"Glushenkova, MARINA/AAC-9443-2019; Zachariadis, Marios/S-1140-2017","Glushenkova, MARINA/0000-0002-4206-3697; Zachariadis, Marios/0000-0002-2308-1881",,,,,36,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

The trace statistic test for cointegration proposed by (Johansen, 1995) demonstrates the presence of such a trend for most unions. A disaggregated analysis identifies a common stochastic trend for several though fewer than half of country pairs within a union. Some unions such as the Eurozone have small shares of cointegrated country pairs. Yet, the share of cointegrated country pairs is large relative to countries outside currency unions. Comparison to a control group (country pairs where one country belongs to a given union and the other country does not) indicates that the cointegration found within a currency union is a union-specific trait and not a feature of the individual countries within the union. These results provide an alternative metric to intraunion trade for gauging the extent of currency union integration.","[Whitten, Gregory W.] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Whitten, GW (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"WHITTEN, Gregory William/0000-0002-4043-5258",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2018,41,9,,,,,2414,2438,,10.1111/twec.12639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12639,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GS6NI,,Green Submitted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000443813500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Theory suggests that if the cost of owning a car increases, people will use other modes of transportation, thus reducing house prices farther away from the CBD and increasing house prices closer to the city center. However, in an empirical setting, the cost of car ownership is likely to be endogenous and correlated with various unobserved factors that also contribute to changes in the house price gradient. To obtain causal effects, we exploit a unique feature of Singapore's car registration process. All cars in Singapore must have a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), but the number available is restricted based on the traffic concerns of the government and are allocated through a competitive bidding process. We use the number of COEs available each quarter as an instrument for the price of a COE, as the quota is likely to be correlated with the price of the COE but not the price of housing at various distances from the CBD. We find that when the price of a COE increases, the price of housing closer to the city center increases, suggesting that increases in the price of a car cause individuals to increase their willingness to pay to locate closer to the CBD.","[Huang, Naqun] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Urban Dev, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Ross, Amanda] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Nanjing Audit University; Singapore Management University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Ross, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",naqun.huang.2012@phdecons.smu.edu.sg; lijing@smu.edu.sg; aross@cba.ua.edu,"Ross, Amanda/AAI-9138-2020; Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X; , Naqun/0000-0003-2559-2690",,,,,34,7,7,3,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

This study evaluates the geographic and temporal scope of the impact of unnatural death on property values in Hong Kong. By exploiting the spatial and intertemporal variation of the shock in a difference-in-differences approach, we find significant negative externalities of unnatural death incidence on neighborhood housing values. On average, units in which an unnatural death occurred experience a 25% drop in value following the death. Nearby units on the same floor also show a significant price drop of 4.5%. Prices of units on other floors of the same building decline about 2.6%. Units in other buildings of the same estate observe a price decline of about 1% on average. However, the price for nearby estates within 300 m shows a positive impact of 0.5%, suggesting a very localized sorting mechanism. Temporally, price evolution after death incidence follows a U shape. Housing prices continue to decline up to 4-5 years after deaths and recover gradually afterwards. We also document the heterogeneity of the impact by the type of death incidence (murder, suicide, or accident) and the type of homebuyers (local buyer, investment firm, and other buyers). We find that the negative externalities of death incidence are largely due to a severe stigma effect, rather than channels through the revealed crime risk or the price contagion effect.","[Chang, Zheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, 6-F,Acad 1 Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",City University of Hong Kong; Singapore Management University,"Chang, Z (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon, 6-F,Acad 1 Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zchang@cityu.edu.hk; lijing@smu.edu.sg,"Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X; chang, zheng/0000-0001-6624-3206",,,,,40,11,11,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

In particular, we construct a hypothesis from theoretical derivation that if airlines do internalize airport congestion the airfare prices would be positively correlated with the interactive term of the airline's passenger number at the origin airport and the congestion delay level of this airport. We test this hypothesis with the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) database and the Airline On-Time Performance database published by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). We find that the hypothesis is supported by the data, suggesting that airlines' behaviour is in line with the internalization theory. We further implement subsample analysis and find that airline type also plays a role in this matter. In particular, while full service carriers internalize airport congestion, low cost carriers do not.","[Guo, Huanxiu] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Changmin] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Wan, Yulai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University; University of Manitoba; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Jiang, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",changmin.jiang@umanitoba.ca,"Jiang, Changmin/AAD-7650-2020","Wan, Yulai/0000-0002-5743-0509",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC 435-2017-0728]; National Science Foundation of China [71803131],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Financial supports from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC 435-2017-0728) and the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71803131) are gratefully acknowledged.,,39,3,3,2,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We use this methodology to model the dynamics of the joint distribution of global stock market and real estate equity returns. The empirical analysis highlights the importance of the conditional distribution in Markov-switching time series models.

First, the economic principle of maximizing the social welfare of the external transport system is analyzed, and a method to calculate the total internal transport cost of the external transport system is proposed. Second, the optimal scale of the port group in an MPR is determined by comparing the total internal costs for different scales of the port group.

Many developed countries are facing the problems of shortage of qualified and skilled seafarers for their maritime industries. Although previous researches tried to unravel the scarce seafarer dilemma, there are very few studies especially in the discussion of the factors affecting the intention to work on-board or go seafaring. This research investigates the effects of shipping knowledge, attitude and reference group opinions on the intention of maritime students to work on-board basing on the knowledge, attitude and intention (KAI) model. Using questionnaire surveys collected from 243 students studying in the maritime and logistics related departments at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Maritime Services Training Institute (MSTI) in Hong Kong. This research fmds that the attitude and reference group opinions positively influence students' intention to work on-board. Although the research hypothesis of the direct influence of shipping knowledge on the intention to work on-board was not supported. Specifically, this research finds the indirect influence of shipping knowledge and reference group opinions on students' on-board intention through attitude. This research provides a comprehensive insight to understand the determinants of students' on-board intention.

The results reveal a perceptible difference in labor migration among adult children whose parents are just above and below the age of pension eligibility: The adult children with a parent just attaining the pension-eligible age are more likely to be labor migrants compared with those with a parent just below the pension-eligible age. We also find that with a pension-eligible parent, the adult children are more likely to have off-farm jobs. These abrupt changes in household behavior at the cutoff suggest that these households are credit constrained. In addition, we find that the pension's effect on migration is greater among adult children with a parent in poor health; pension-eligible elderly report that they are more likely to use inpatient services when needed and less likely to rely on adult children for care when they are ill. These results suggest that (expectations regarding) providing care for elderly parents has constrained labor migration from China's rural areas to some extent, and that the new rural pension program has helped to relax this constraint.","[Eggleston, Karen] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sun, Ang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA USA",Stanford University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Tsinghua University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Sun, A (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",karene@stanford.edu; ang.sun@gmail.com; zhanzhg@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","The research for this article was financed by the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University.

We first explore the typical equilibrium mode-choice patterns with exogenous city boundary and population distribution, and then incorporate the residents' mode choice into an urban spatial equilibrium model, in which the residents' household consumption, the residential location choice and the property developers' housing production are also explicitly modeled. Using comparative static analysis, we find that the urban corridor expands with the increase of railway fare if there is no congestion in the bimodal transportation system, but it's not necessarily the case if highway congestion and transit crowding cannot be ignored. We provide numerical evidence to show that the urban corridor possibly shrinks with the increase of railway fare once congestion effects are considered. We also discuss the changes of urban form, utility level of residents and social welfare with different railway fare and subsidy policies. Numerical results show that the distance-based fare policy with low subsidy should be preferred because it can realize the Pareto-improved social welfare and utility level of residents.","[Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Tian-Liang; Huang, Hai-Jun] Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Ronghui] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Beihang University; University of Leeds,"Liu, TL (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",liutianliang@buaa.edu.cn,"Huang, Hai-Jun/AAP-2269-2020","Huang, Hai-Jun/0000-0002-9001-9172",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project [RSSB-T1071]; Royal Academy of Engineering [UK-CIAPP/286]; China Scholarship Council,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project; Royal Academy of Engineering(Royal Academy of Engineering - UK); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The research described in this paper was jointly supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71771007), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project RSSB-T1071 and the Royal Academy of Engineering Newton Fund project UK-CIAPP/286.

However, empirical evidence for this is largely lacking. This study intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of business models, in particular battery and vehicle leasing, on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. By conducting a stated choice experiment, we examine to what extent car drivers switch their choices between conventional and electric vehicles after business models become available. The results based on the discrete choice model suggest that leasing does not increase EV adoption at the aggregate level. However, a latent transition analysis shows that different groups with internally homogeneous preferences react differently to leasing options at the disaggregate level. The results indicate that 13% of the car drivers changed their preferences, albeit in different ways. Transition probabilities are particularly related to attitudes towards leasing and knowledge of EV. The results show that leasing is useful in facilitating EV adoption for certain groups, which can be identified by their individual characteristics.

As a result, various maritime safety measures have been developed, including Port State Control (PSC) inspections. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Bayesian Network (BN) based approach to analyse risk factors influencing PSC inspections, and predict the probability of vessel detention. To do so, inspection data of bulk carriers in seven major European countries from 2005 to 20081 in Paris MoU is collected to identify the relevant risk factors. Meanwhile, the network structure is constructed via TAN learning and subsequently validated by sensitivity analysis. The results reveal two conclusions: first, the key risk factors influencing PSC inspections include number of deficiencies, type of inspection, Recognised Organisation (RO) and vessel age. Second, the model exploits a novel way to predict the detention probabilities under different situations, which effectively help port authorities to rationalise their inspection regulations as well as allocation of the resources. Further effort will be made to conduct contrastive analysis between 'Pre-NIR' period and 'Post-NIR' period to test the impact of NIR started in 2008.","[Yang, Zhisen; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Yin, Jingbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Dept Int Shipping, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Liverpool John Moores University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Yang, ZL (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",Z.Yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"Yang, Zhisen/JRW-3214-2023; zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X",EU Marie Curie grant [ENRICH - 612546]; Liverpool John Moores University UK,EU Marie Curie grant; Liverpool John Moores University UK,This research was supported by an EU Marie Curie grant (ENRICH - 612546) and PhD scholarship by Liverpool John Moores University UK.,,73,113,119,26,154,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We use the BCP quasi-likelihood ratio test and deal with the new multifold identification problem that arises under the null of the polynomial model. The approach leads to convenient asymptotic theory for inference, has omnibus power against general nonlinear alternatives, and allows estimation of an unknown polynomial degree in a model by way of sequential testing, a technique that is useful in the application of sieve approximations. Simulations show good performance in the sequential test procedure in both identifying and estimating unknown polynomial order. The approach, which can be used empirically to test for misspecification, is applied to a Mincer (Journal of Political Economy, 1958, 66, 281-302; Schooling, Experience and Earnings, Columbia University Press, 1974) equation using data from Card (in Christofides, Grant, and Swidinsky (Eds.), Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp, University of Toronto Press, 1995, 201-222) and Bierens and Ginther (Empirical Economics, 2001, 26, 307-324). The results confirm that the standard Mincer log earnings equation is readily shown to be misspecified. The applications consider different datasets and examine the impact of nonlinear effects of experience and schooling on earnings, allowing for flexibility in the respective polynomial representations.","[Cho, Jin Seo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonse Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Cho, Jin Seo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

In particular, for China with a vast territory and a large number of ethnic groups, the integration of various ethnic groups and regions is the important driving force of regional culture and of economic development. Although the current national policies in our country promote the integration and unity among different ethnic groups, there are still some contradictions, disputes and studies among different ethnic groups under the influence of different cultures, living habits and historical development. The national integration in Chinese history can achieve the true psychological harmony between different ethnic groups so as to promote the common prosperity and development among all ethnic groups.

We also examine whether the heterogeneity in environmental regulatory standards between these regions has emboldened Asian airlines to be less eco-friendly and/or more market-share seeking. We find that the environmental performance of European airlines improved continuously between 2007 and 2013, unlike their competitors in Asia. We argue that this improvement in the environmental performance of the European airlines could be an outcome of the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), which set incentives for European airlines to renew their fleets and optimise their operations. Our technological gap ratio estimates also point to some Asian airlines outperforming all other airlines on technological measures, indicating they operate in a more favourable business environment. Overall, our method contributes to the methodological enhancement of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and allows deeper insights into firm operations in general, and environmental efficiency analysis of European and Asian airlines in particular.","[Arjomandi, Amir] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Dakpo, K.

On average, CRH accessibility positively affects regional tourism economies, reflected in a 12% net increase in tourism revenue for a region. By dividing the database into different subsets, this study demonstrates that the significantly positive impacts only occur for regions where the overall level of accessibility is low. Moreover, this study reveals that among regions connected by CRH networks, the regions of which the levels of tourism development are comparatively low will experience a bigger jump in tourism economy than the regions of which the levels of tourism development are already high, and hence the dispersion effect of CRH networks is demonstrated. This study also concludes the lagged effects of CRH accessibility are much greater than its immediate effects. By virtue of these conclusions, this study suggests the ways for governments and tourism organizations to take advantage of the development of high-speed trains in China.","[Zhou Bo; Li Ningqiao] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Zhou, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Management Sch, Dept Tourism & Hotel Adm, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",friendzhoubo@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71773101, 71172048]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (the number of the project is 71773101 and 71172048).",,34,31,33,7,153,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

(J Econ Dyn Control 32:101-136, 2008) as a prototype agent-based model that allows reproducing the main stylized facts of financial returns. The model does so by combining fundamental news driven by Brownian motion with a minimalistic mechanism for generating boundedly rational sentiment dynamics. Since we can approximate the herding component among an ensemble of agents in the aggregate by a Langevin equation, we can either simulate the model in full at the micro level, or via an approximate aggregate law of motion. In the simplest version of our model, only three parameters need to be estimated. We explore the performance of a simulated method of moments (SMM) approach for the estimation of this model. As it turns out, sensible parameter estimates can only be obtained if one first provides a rough mapping of the objective function via an extensive grid search. Due to the high correlations of the estimated parameters, uninformed choices will often lead to a convergence to any one of a large number of local minima. We also find that the efficiency of SMM is relatively insensitive to the size of the simulated sample over a relatively large range of sample sizes and the SMM estimates converge to their GMM counterparts only for large sample sizes. We believe that this feature is due to the limited range of moments available in univariate asset pricing models, and that the sensitivity of the present model to the specification of the SMM estimator could carry over to many related agent-based models of financial markets as well as to similar diffusion processes in mathematical finance.","[Chen, Zhenxi] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",South China University of Technology; University of Kiel; Universitat Jaume I,"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",lux@economics.uni-kiel.de,,"chen, zhenxi/0000-0001-9743-7994",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [612955],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 612955.

We further develop a Method of Successive Average (MSA)-based sequential optimization algorithm for large-scale evacuation problems. Both the proposed model and the solution algorithm are tested and validated through a set of numerical tests on a small network, and a detailed case study on the Lower Manhattan network. The results of the paper can provide insight on modeling flow interactions of different transportation modes and useful guidance on developing evacuation strategies to reduce the system evacuation time and losses from disasters.","[Yang, Xia] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 110 Eighth St,Room JEC 5107, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Ban, Xuegang (Jeff)] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 121G,More Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ban, Xuegang (Jeff)] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Mitchell, John] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Math Sci, 110 Eighth St,Room Amos Eaton 325, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Shanghai Maritime University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Ban, XG (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 121G,More Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",banx@uw.edu,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1055555]; US Department of Transportation (USDOT); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Transportation (USDOT); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning,"The authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments to the earlier versions of the paper.

The way in which visual communication is generally presented is mainly through visual design of graphics, colors, and so on. With the development of network technology and the blending of new media forms, diversity in its visual communication has changed. Visual communication is made quickly and profoundly based on visual information. Through the expression of graphics, colors, and words, the forms of expression are varied and the methods of expression are different. Through the multi-faceted development of visual design, the visual space has a more meaningful meaning.

(1963) has become one of the standard methods to estimate a constant-quality price index. The model, however, fails to adjust for depreciation, as age and time between sales have an exact linear relationship. This paper proposes a new method to estimate an age-adjusted repeat sales index by decomposing property value into land and structure components. As depreciation is more relevant to the structure than land, the property's depreciation rate should depend on the relative size of land and structure. The larger the land component, the lower the depreciation rate of the property. This new method is applied to property transactions in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Hong Kong is shown to have a higher depreciation rate based on a fixed structure-to-property value ratio, while the resulting age adjustment is larger in Tokyo because its land value has shrunken over time.","[Wong, Siu Kei; Chau, K.

We first lay out a framework of market integration in the context of global LNG market where the main supplier (e.g. Qatar) may have market power. Estimating a time-varying coefficients model, we find that a varying degree of market integration exists between all four LNG indices particularly after the Fukushima incident in 2011. We complement the time-varying coefficient analysis with a test of price convergence among the LNG indices using the Phillips-Sul (2007) methodology. The results reveal that, there is strong evidence that the spot LNG prices are converging after the Fukushima accident and they are also converging with the price of NBP in the UK. The empirical result is consistent with the change of market power of the main supplier.","[Mu, Xiaoyi] Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Carnegie Bldg, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Ye, Haichun] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Res Dept, Int Finance Ctr 2, 55th Floor,8 Finance St, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Dundee; Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Mu, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Carnegie Bldg, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",x.mu@dundee.ac.uk; haichunye@gmail.com,,"Mu, Xiaoyi/0000-0002-3280-6426",,,,,30,6,6,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2018,39,1,,,,,211,233,,10.5547/01956574.39.1.xmu,http://dx.doi.org/10.5547/01956574.39.1.xmu,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS0PR,,Green Submitted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000419476700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Speed - density relationship is the foundation of the traffic flow theory and transportation engineering, as it represents the mathematical relationship among the three fundamental parameters of traffic flow. It was long believed that single regime models could not well represent all traffic states ranging from free flow conditions to jam conditions until Qu et al. (2015) pointed out that the inaccuracy was not caused solely by their functional forms, but also by sample selection bias. They then applied a new calibration method (named as Qu-Wang-Zhang model hereafter) to address the sample selection bias. With this Qu-Wang-Zhang model, the result calibrated from observational data sample can consistently well represent all traffic states ranging from free flow conditions to traffic jam conditions. In the current paper, we use a fundamentally different approach that is able to yield very similar and consistent results with the Qu-Wang-Zhang model. The proposed approach firstly applies reproducible sample generation to convert the observational data to experimental data. The traditional least square method (LSM) can subsequently be applied to calibrate accurate traffic flow fundamental diagrams. Two reproducible sample generation approaches are proposed in this research. Based on our analyses, the first approach is somewhat affected by outliers and the second approach is more robust in dealing with potential outliers.","[Zhang, Jin] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Zhang, Jin; Qu, Xiaobo] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wang, Shuaian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Nanshan Dist, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuaian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Chalmers University of Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Qu, XB (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden.",drxiaoboqu@gmail.com; wangshuaian@gmail.com,"Qu, Xiaobo/AAG-4777-2021; Wang, Shuai/HZJ-7466-2023; Wang, Shuaian/C-3559-2012; Qu, Xiaobo/C-4182-2013","Qu, Xiaobo/0000-0003-0973-3756; Wang, Shuaian/0000-0001-9247-4403",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771050],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We want to express our special thanks to Dr. Daiheng Ni from UMass Amherst and Dr. Haizhong Wang from Oregon State University for their data support.

This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an eco-compensation program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). Eco-compensation is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.","[Bennett, Michael T.] 555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA; [Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhoongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane,Room 178, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Econ, Verona, Italy",Renmin University of China; Durham University; University of Waikato; University of Verona,"Bennett, MT (通讯作者)，555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA.",bennett.michaelt@gmail.com; ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009",,,,,,113,44,48,6,155,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future.","[Thompson, Wyatt; Gerlt, Scott] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Lu, Yaqiong; Yang, Xianyu; Kueppers, Lara M.] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, 5200 North Lake Rd,Sci & Engn 277, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Yang, Xianyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Campbell, J.

We identify several important relationships in bilateral carbon flows, including China-EU, China-USA, Russia-EU, and China-Japan, which make China and Russia the largest carbon exporters and the EU and the USA the largest carbon importers. A further investigation of the sectors contributing to carbon flows shows that exports from the mineral, chemicals, metals, oil, transport, and other manufacturing sectors are the main cause of carbon outflows, while the intermediate inputs of the electricity and transport sectors are the primary cause of carbon outflows due to export production. Moreover, we propose an intensity-based shared responsibility strategy and find that China should take the most responsibility because it is responsible for nearly 32% of all embodied emissions, due to its less efficient and high carbon-intensive technologies. The USA and the EU follow China, with shares of 13.2% and 11.3%, respectively, owing to their heavy consumption. As a result, China and the USA contribute 31.8% and 20.6%, respectively, of the total global emissions, outweighing the aggregated contribution from all other countries/regions.","[Zhu, Yongbin; Wu, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yongbin; Wu, Jing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yajuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yajuan] Henan Univ Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Leying] Henan Univ, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wen] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Henan University of Technology; Henan University; Beijing Technology & Business University","Wu, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",zhuyongbin@casipm.ac.cn; wujing@casipm.ac.cn,"Xiong, Wenbin/GQP-8667-2022",,"National Basic Research Program of China [2016YFA0602700, 2012CB955804]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14CGJ025]; National Science Foundation of China [41201594]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China [grant number 2016YFA0602700, 2012CB955804]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 14CGJ025]; and the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 41201594].",,44,63,66,17,119,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Based on data of 580 firms in the Top-1000 Enterprise Energy Saving Program during 2006 and 2009, we differentiate between technological change embodied in new production capital and disembodied technological change. We find that both types of changes clearly led to energy efficiency. Firms of domestic ownership and higher profit were more prone to making investment with embodied technological changes. Energy efficiency rates associated with embodied technological change were higher among younger firms and those with more intensive use of energy. Energy saving associated with disembodied technological change was higher in firms of state or foreign ownership, larger scale, orientation toward domestic market, and more intensive use of energy. The findings call for the need to carefully consider the effect of different policy instruments in energy saving, and to track long-term energy statistics at the micro-level.","[Zhu, Junming] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Niu, Limin; Shi, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ruth, Matthias] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; University of Alberta,"Zhu, JM (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Shi, L (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",junming@tsinghua.edu.cn; slone@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Zhu, Junming/0000-0002-6160-1323","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704092]; US National Science Foundation through its Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants [1303113]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20121088096]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1303113] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation through its Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The authors would like to thank Lin Hou for geocoding and mapping the top-1000 enterprises and Xiao Li and Da Zhang for their helpful comments on earlier versions of the research.

Improving the livelihoods of environmental services (ES) suppliers is not only seen as a side benefit but is often considered a prerequisite for the viability of PES. Yet, the ability to draw 'overview lessons' over the impacts of PES on livelihoods from literature review studies remains limited. To overcome these shortcomings, we undertake a meta-analysis of causal statistical studies on the effects of PES on the livelihoods of ES suppliers in the developing world. The set-up of our meta-analysis allows us to draw more conservative but more reliable and generalisable overview lessons. Our findings suggest that PES programmes are likely to have positive but modest livelihood impacts on ES suppliers. Further, several institutional characteristics of PES are found to be correlated with more favourable livelihood impacts, such as high payments, high degree of voluntary participation, low transaction costs and better access to alternative income sources. Lastly, our results highlight the importance of controlling for unobservable confounders when undertaking original evaluation studies on the impacts of PES. These factors should be incorporated in the design, implementation and evaluation of PES.","[Liu, Zhaoyang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Peking University; University of Cambridge,"Kontoleon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",ak219@cam.ac.uk,"LIU, Z/AAD-2255-2020","LIU, Z/0000-0003-0124-0113",,,,,104,38,40,4,92,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The insolvency of risk creators in case of such disasters may lead to insufficient compensation as well as to a dilution of preventive incentives. Insurance is a traditional instrument to address these problems, but is subject to limitations such as the lack of information by the insurers on the risk and limited insurance capacity. The risk-sharing agreement is an alternative which is widely used in high-risk sectors but it received relative little attention in academic literature. This paper analyses the potential of risk-sharing agreements in minimizing total social costs of environmental harmful activities, in comparison with insurance. The comparison shows the advantage of risk-sharing agreements in terms of less demanding information requirements, allowing for mutual monitoring and the potential to reduce administrative costs. However, the analysis also shows that a few conditions need to be met for such advantages to be materialized. This paper then discusses a typology of various risk-sharing agreements and illustrates the different categories with examples from the maritime and nuclear sectors. Based on these experiences, this paper explores the possibilities to expand risk-sharing agreements to other policy areas where environmental risks may emerge.","[Liu, Jing] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Faure, Michael] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Faure, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Wuhan University; Maastricht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liujoyjing@163.com; michael.faure@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Faure, Michael/0000-0001-8756-7832",Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [14YJC820033]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,"Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","Funding was provide by the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 14YJC820033), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",,46,10,13,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

DEA has immediately been recognized as a modern tool for performance measurement. Since then, a large and considerable amount of articles has been appeared, including significant breakthroughs in theory and a great portion of works on DEA applications, both public and private sectors, to assess the efficiency and productivity of their activities. Although there have been several bibliographic collections reported, a comprehensive analysis and listing of DEA-related articles covering its first four decades of history is still missing. This paper, thus, aims to report an extensive listing of DEA-related articles including theory and methodology developments and real applications in diversified scenarios from 1978 to end of 2016.

So far, the literature has reported mixed results on the relationship between corporate sustainability and financial performance. Drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory, we develop a focal hypothesis arguing that the financial effect of corporate sustainability performance is negatively impacted by country-level sustainability performance because stakeholders will take a firm's sustainability improvement for granted in countries with good social and environmental performance. We test this focal hypothesis in a cross-country setting drawing on the 6th International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. The current study supplements these data with secondary data drawn from the Human Development Index and the Environmental Performance Index. The results support our hypothesis that firms in countries with higher levels of sustainability performance generally find it more difficult to capitalize on corporate sustainability performance than do their counterparts in countries with relatively low levels of sustainability performance. This outcome helps to explain the mixed findings in the literature. Moreover, our study suggests that sustainability management can be a source of competitive advantage for firms located in emerging and developing countries, where in general the level of sustainability performance is relatively","[Xiao, Chengyong; Wang, Qian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Zhongguancun Donglu 80, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Chengyong; van der Vaart, Taco; van Donk, Dirk Pieter] Univ Groningen, Dept Operat, Fac Econ & Business, Nettlebosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Groningen","Xiao, CY (通讯作者)，Dui 651,Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",c.xiao@rug.nl; qianwang@ucas.ac.cn; j.t.van.der.vaart@rug.nl; d.p.van.donk@rug.nl,"van donk, Dirk/A-5255-2010; Wang, Qian/AFY-9644-2022; Van der Vaart, Taco/A-5236-2010","Wang, Qian/0000-0001-5986-6595; van Donk, Dirk Pieter/0000-0001-8861-1188; Van der Vaart, Taco/0000-0002-3102-9426; Xiao, Chengyong/0000-0002-3225-4465",National Science Foundation of China [71371178],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by National Science Foundation of China under the grant 71371178.,,78,62,65,9,125,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Using comprehensive stock and bond data, we calculate a measure of market liquidity for the period 1825-70. We find that stock market liquidity trended upwards but bond market liquidity did not increase over the sample period. Stock market liquidity during our sample period was partially influenced by the bond market, rather than fluctuations in economic output. In our analysis of the cross-sectional determinants of individual stock liquidity, we find that firm size and the number of issued shares were important determinants of liquidity. Finally, we find little evidence of an illiquidity premium, which is consistent with the view that investors did not price liquidity in this nascent market.","[Campbell, Gareth; Turner, John D.] Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Ye, Qing] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Queens University Belfast; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Ye, Q (通讯作者)，Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",Qing.Ye@xjtlu.edu.cn,,,ESRC [RES-000-22-1391]; ESRC [RES-000-22-1391] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-1391] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Thanks to the ESRC (RES-000-22-1391) for financial support and Graeme Acheson for his input into this project.,,60,8,8,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

With mental health becoming an increasingly significant public health issue in China, empirical evidence of disparities in the use of mental health services can guide steps to reduce them. We conducted this study to inform China's on-going health-care reform through examining how health insurance might reduce rural-urban disparities in the utilization of mental health inpatient services in China. This retrospective study used 10years (2005-2014) of hospital electronic health records from the Shandong Center for Mental Health and the DaiZhuang Psychiatric Hospital, two major psychiatric hospitals in Shandong Province. Health insurance was measured using types of health insurance and the actual reimbursement ratio (RR). Utilization of mental health inpatient services was measured by hospitalization cost, length of stay (LOS), and frequency of hospitalization. We examined rural-urban disparities in the use of mental health services, as well as the role of health insurance in reducing such disparities. Hospitalization costs, LOS, and frequency of hospitalization were all found to be lower among rural than among urban inpatients. Having health insurance and benefiting from a relatively high RR were found to be significantly associated with a greater utilization of inpatient services, among both urban and rural residents. In addition, an increase in the RR was found to be significantly associated with an increase in the use of mental health services among rural patients. Consistent with the existing literature, our study suggests that increasing insurance schemes' reimbursement levels could lead to substantial increases in the use of mental health inpatient services among rural patients, and a reduction in rural-urban disparities in service utilization. In order to promote mental health care and reduce rural-urban disparities in its utilization in China, improving rural health insurance coverage (e.g., reducing the coinsurance rate) would be a powerful policy instrument.","[Xu, Junfang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Res Ctr Publ Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Shandong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Adm, Ctr Hlth Econ Expt & Publ Policy, 44 Wen Hua Xi Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [King, Madeleine] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ruiyun; Xing, Jinshui; Su, Lei] Shandong Ctr Mental Hlth, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fenghua] Shandong Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mingshan] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB, Canada",Tsinghua University; Shandong University; Tsinghua University; University of Calgary,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Adm, Ctr Hlth Econ Expt & Publ Policy, 44 Wen Hua Xi Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangjiannan@sdu.edu.cn,"Wang, Jian/AAI-6424-2021","Wang, Jian/0000-0001-8769-7928",Department of Health in Shandong [2013WS0152] Funding Source: Medline,Department of Health in Shandong,,,49,38,40,3,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

To guide management intervention for sustainable development after natural disasters, scientists and policymakers need a better understanding of the linkages between livelihood changes after natural disasters and recovery outcomes. Despite the growing body of disaster research, systematic evaluation of the relationship between post-disaster changes in rural livelihoods and recovery outcomes is rare, largely due to the lack of relevant data. By taking advantage of the long-term data collection and research conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve (Wolong), we empirically evaluated livelihood changes after the catastrophic 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and how those changes are linked to the recovery of human well-being. Our results show that households' livelihood portfolios in Wolong conspicuously changed after the earthquake and that human well-being had been recovering. However, we found most of these livelihood changes negatively affected, instead of facilitated, human well-being recovery.

Heavy reliance on fuelwood is associated with numerous negative externalities. Due to decades of rapid economic growth in China, we hypothesize that the increase in rural household income would reduce reliance on fuelwood. Using data from a survey of 481 households conducted in 2014, we examined the effects of two payments for ecosystem services programs, the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP) and the Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP), on energy use, along with other factors. We found that the CCFP did not significantly affect fuel choice nor the quantity of fuelwood used, but households with more forestland in EWFP were less likely to adopt modern fuels and likely to use more fuelwood. Household per capita annual income was the main factor promoting adoption of modem fuels, while household size was the most important factor determining the quantity of fuelwood used per capita. Overall, the gradually increasing adoption of modern fuels has thus far not resulted in any significant abandonment of fuelwood. Fuelwood remains the dominant fuel across all income groups, suggesting that households in the study area are in the early stages of the energy transition.","[Song, Conghe; Bilsborrow, Richard; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Xiaodong] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard; Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog & Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Huang, Qingfeng] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Anhui Agricultural University,"Song, CH (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",csong@email.unc.edu,"chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; Zhang, Qi/I-9741-2016; Song, Conghe/E-3087-2016","Zhang, Qi/0000-0002-4242-7614; bilsborrow, richard/0000-0002-0053-7356; Song, Conghe/0000-0002-4099-4906",National Science Foundation [DEB-1313756]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1313756] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-1313756) to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

China has witnessed the orchestration of city-regionalism and two different regional-scale mechanisms have influenced this integration and cooperation: the top-down state-mandated process and the bottom-up process initiated by local governments. However, this has not been a smooth process and it is shaped by the internal politics generated by China's state configurations. Using the Yangtze River Delta as a case study, this paper argues that China's territorial administrative divisions are a historical configuration that is essential to understand the efforts to construct city-regions as well as to understand the failure to create a new sub-national state space.","[Li, Yi] Hohai Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Natl Res Ctr Resettlement, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Fulong] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, London, England",Hohai University; University of London; University College London,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Natl Res Ctr Resettlement, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",emilyliyi@hotmail.com; fulong.wu@ucl.ac.uk,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601157],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The first author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and publication of this article.

The results show that political boundaries and historical patterns of socio-economic integration are strikingly visible, and the effects of overlapping physical, economic, cultural and administrative spaces on regional integration are apparent.

In applications the focus of interest is on capturing joint tail behavior rather than a variation around the mean. Quantile and expectile regression are used here as tools of data analysis. When it comes to characterizing tail event curves one faces a dimensionality problem, which is important for CoVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) determination. A projection-based single-index model specification may come to the rescue but for ultrahigh-dimensional regressors one faces yet another dimensionality problem and needs to balance precision versus dimension. Such a balance is achieved by combining semiparametric ideas with variable selection techniques. In particular, we propose a projection-based single-index model specification for very high-dimensional regressors. This model is used for practical CoVaR estimates with a systemically chosen indicator. In simulations we demonstrate the practical side of the semiparametric CoVaR method. The application to the U.S. financial sector shows good backtesting results and indicate market coagulation before the crisis period.

This paper identifies administrative factors and market barriers as the main causes of renewable curtailment. In 2017, the Northwest Power Grid (NWPG) successfully implemented a variety of approaches to reduce wind and solar curtailment. In this paper, we analyze the change in power generation, expansion of renewable energy delivery, and electricity-replacement projects across provinces that occurred in 2017. While acknowledging the practical results of the NWPG's efforts, we identify challenges that the northwest still faces in integrating renewable energy. We argue that trans-regional administrative barriers are preventing the effective utilization of renewable energy nationwide. To address those barriers, we explore market-based mechanisms for promoting the integration of large-scale renewable energy. In addition to long-term contracts for renewable energy across provinces, both spot-market and the ancillary service market would facilitate the uptake of renewable energy. In addition, price signals should be used to guide peak shaving. Market mechanisms will be insightful to dissolve barriers and enhance utilization of renewable energy throughout the country.","[Liu, Shiyu; Bie, Zhaohong; Wang, Xifan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Smart Grid Key Lab Shaanxi Prov, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lin, Jiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bie, ZH (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Smart Grid Key Lab Shaanxi Prov, State Key Lab Elect Insulat & Power Equipment, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liushiyu982@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; zhbie@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; j_lin@lbl.gov; xfwang@xjtu.edu.cn,"liu, shiyu/JSL-3045-2023; liu, shiyu/HTR-8039-2023","Bie, Zhaohong/0000-0002-8458-0887","National Science Foundation of China [U1610122, 51577147]; Hewlett Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; MJS",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hewlett Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; MJS,"We appreciate National Science Foundation of China for supporting this study (U1610122, 51577147).

There is a growing body of literature evaluating the extent of this corresponding price reduction, termed 'incentive pass-through', typically finding nearly complete path-through for host-owned systems. However, few studies hitherto had the data to reliably estimate path-through for third-party owned systems, which comprise most of new installations over this period. This study evaluates incentive pass-through for third-party owned systems in California between 2010 and 2014. The estimation results show path-through rate is around 62%, suggesting that unlike host-owned systems, a portion of the incentive reduced the contract price of the system and the rest of the incentive was retained by the installer. This study has important implications for future subsidy program design in the presence of different ownership types in the market.","[Li, Yumin] Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Li, Yumin] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Shanghai University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Li, YM (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",yuminli@shu.edu.cn,"lu, qian/IUN-7445-2023",,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The author would like to thank Changgui Dong, Zhuoxin Li, Shiyuan Li, Ben Sigrin, Daniel Steinberg, Carolyn Pino, Ruxiao Wang and Jarret Zuboy for their review and input on the study.

In the continuous time situation, the factional Brownian motion B-H and its extension are an important class of models to characterize the long memory or short memory of data, and Hurst parameter H is an index to describe the degree of dependence. In this article, we estimate the Hurst parameter of a discretely sampled fractional integral process corrupted by noise.

Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.","[Lilliestam, Johan; Hanger, Susanne; Komendantova, Nadejda; Patt, Anthony] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lilliestam, Johan] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Barradi, Touria] MENARES, Casablanca, Morocco; [Caldes, Natalia] CIEMAT, Energy Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Gomez, Marta] Dow Chem, Tarragona, Spain; [Kern, Jurgen] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, Stuttgart, Germany; [Mehos, Mark] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Thermal Syst Grp, Golden, CO USA; [Hong, Wai Mun] Univ Autonoma Madrid, MERIGG, Madrid, Spain; [Wang, Zhifeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Autonomous University of Madrid; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Electrical Engineering, CAS","Lilliestam, J (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",johan.lilliestam@usys.ethz.ch,"Komendantova, Nadejda/AAI-1536-2021","Komendantova, Nadejda/0000-0003-2568-6179; Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991; Patt, Anthony/0000-0001-8428-8707",European Research Council [313553]; European Research Council (ERC) [313553] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This paper is based on a workshop held in Abu Dhabi in October 2016, to which all authors attended.

The basic idea is to conduct the standard GMM estimation combined with two penalty terms: the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage and the quadratic regularization. It is a one-step procedure of valid moment condition selection, nonzero structural parameter selection (i.e., model selection), and consistent estimation of the nonzero parameters. The procedure achieves the standard GMM efficiency bound as if we know the valid moment conditions ex ante, for which the quadratic regularization is important. We also study the tuning parameter choice, with which we show that selection consistency still holds without assuming Gaussianity. We apply the new estimation procedure to dynamic panel data models, where both the time and cross-section dimensions are large. The new estimator is robust to possible serial correlations in the regression error terms.","[Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Han, Xu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; City University of Hong Kong; Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.;Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.",caner.12@osu.edu; xuhan25@cityu.edu.hk; ylee41@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Lee, Yoonseok/0000-0002-8379-0700",,,,,26,13,14,1,12,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Especially in China, where the demands for transportation are tremendous and ever-increasing, it is worthy to explore the provincial variations in energy efficiency in the transport sector, in order to enhance energy efficiency and to promote energy savings in this sector. By using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach, this paper calculates the provincial energy efficiency as well as energy saving potential in China's provincial transport sector over 2007-2016. Results suggest that China's national average energy input efficiency in the transport industry is 0.673 during the sample period, which implied that relatively large degree of non-efficiency exists in this sector. Besides, the increase of government support (GS), the improvement of road condition (RC) and public transport (PT) are influencing factors for the improvement of China's provincial energy efficiency in the transport industry. Additionally, energy saving potential in the transport sector is also estimated in this paper. It is shown that, although energy efficiency in the eastern China is the highest (much higher than the country-wide level), the estimated absolute amount of the energy saving potential in the eastern area is significantly larger than those in the central area and western area due to the fact that the eastern area contributes to the largest share of the total energy consumption in this sector.","[Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bai, Mengqi] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nucl Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Wang, Xiaolei] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; China University of Mining & Technology,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaoleiwang@cumt.edu.cn,"Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022","Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631; wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180664],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),The paper is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no.

This paper aims to investigate the potential factors that influence the choices of rural residents regarding water heaters with a focus on the low-carbon transition to solar water heating systems. To this end, a face-to-face questionnaire survey is undertaken with 3404 rural households randomly selected among 12 representative provinces. A comprehensive set of discrete choice modelling approaches were used. The empirical results show that (1) sociodemographic variables have significant effects on residents' first-stage choice of a water heater (to buy or not to buy) but few effects on the second-stage decision to choose electric, LPG, or solar water heaters (which type to buy); (2) information spillover is important to facilitate the usage of water heaters, particularly of solar products; (3) the electricity price, which is regulated at a very low rate, has no apparent effect on the choice of solar water heaters; (4) government subsidy has a significant effect in the first stage but no differentiated effect on the decision choice in the second stage.

This study aims to develop an efficiency evaluation framework using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to guide the selection of the most efficient ESCO measures in different parts of China. Data from 1304 ESCO projects in six parts of Mainland China were examined using DEA to determine the efficiency of 15 energy-saving measures in the manufacturing and building sectors. The results indicate that reconstruction of industrial boiler furnaces is the most energy-efficient measure in the manufacturing sector, while energy management systems are the most efficient measure in the building sector. The variation in the statuses of economic development and the climate conditions of the six areas of China are the major factors for the differences in efficiency. A decision-making tool for guiding the selection of the ESCO measures with the most efficient technologies for specific regions and end-uses is developed to provide comprehensive information to both investors and the ESCOs.","[Zheng, Saina; Lam, Chor-Man; Hsu, Shu-Chien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jingzheng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind Syst & Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Hsu, SC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mark.hsu@polyu.edu.hk,"Ren, Jingzheng/ABF-5240-2020","Ren, Jingzheng/0000-0002-9690-5183; Hsu, Shu-Chien/0000-0002-7232-9839",Hong Kong Research Grants Council [25220615],Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),The authors express their thanks for the grant supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant No. 25220615).,,79,28,28,2,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122,,,,,,580,591,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.011,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,Green Accepted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000447576700054,View Full Record in Web of Science

The motivation of the paper is to analysis the nexus between technical progress and energy rebound effects. Based on a three-input trans-log cost function model, we first estimate the share equation and the corresponding price elasticity for each input factor. Then, the rebound effect in China's iron & steel industry over 1985-2015 is evaluated through decomposing the energy prices. Empirical results show that: (1) The price elasticities of input factors are negative; (2) Energy/capital and energy/labor show substitute relationships; (3) The average energy rebound effect in the ISI is as high as 73.88%; (4) The energy rebound effect shows a downward trend before the 11th Five-year period and then an upward trend after that. Therefore, policies proposals of lowering the rebound effect should be placed not only on technical progress, but also on energy price reform by reducing energy subsidies and thus accelerating energy price marketization, so as to promote energy substitution, reduce energy rebound effect and produce further economic and environmental benefits.","[Wang, Xiaolei; Wen, Xiaohui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",China University of Mining & Technology; University of Birmingham,"Xie, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,"Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016; wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023","Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631; wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341;",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology [2017QNB03],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology,The paper is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology (No. 2017QNB03).,,46,31,32,2,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123,,,,,,259,265,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.016,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000453499700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper analyzes the convergence of cross-province energy intensity in China based on panel data of 29 provinces for the period 2003-2015 by means of sigma convergence, kernel density analysis, and unconditional and conditional beta convergence. The empirical results show that the omission of spatial spillovers underestimates conditional beta convergence. We thus argue that the implementation of effective policy for reducing energy intensity depends not only on the driving forces in the own province but also on the spatial spillover effects in neighboring provinces, particularly technology transfer, knowledge spillovers, and the input-output relationship. From the analysis, it follows that adopting low-energy capital, attracting more FDI inflows and developing indigenous innovation capabilities are major policy handles.","[Jiang, Lei] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lei] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Ji, Minhe] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Zhou, P.] China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Nanchang University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; University of Groningen; East China Normal University; China University of Petroleum,"Zhou, P (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",lei_jiang@zufe.edu.cn; pzhou@upc.edu.cn,"Zhao, YiAn/JFK-5881-2023; Zhou, Peng/A-6527-2012; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023","Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4726-3054;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573119, 71625005]; Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education [17YJC790061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education,"The authors are grateful to the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573119 and 71625005), and Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education (No. 17YJC790061).",,48,74,77,9,91,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121,,,,,,252,263,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.043,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Published,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000445983800026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Scenario analyses and case study were applied to illustrate the results, which show five basic conclusions. 1) Low-carbon development doesn't require eliminating energy consumption completely during urbanization 2) The average level of urbanization is relatively low owing to the large disparities among provinces and the provinces' economic development. Though the development of low-carbon in the 30 provinces is generally rapid, the gap between the highest provinces and the lowest provinces is relatively large because of their different socio-economic features. 3) Much more attention should be paid to CO2 emissions per capita. The quality of public social service,the basic and medical insurance coverage for the elderly, the community service coverage in infrastructure and the green design during urban construction should be improved. 4) The coordination of CUS is closely related to the different development stages and geographic locations of each province. 5) For different types of provinces with different degrees of coupling coordination,there is a need to explore different development directions.","[Song, Qijiao; Liu, Tianle; Qi, Ye] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Song, Qijiao] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Management, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Nan; Siehr, Stephanie A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Dept, China Energy Grp, Berkeley, CA USA; [Siehr, Stephanie A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Tsinghua University; Capital Normal University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Qi, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qi@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tianle/0000-0003-4995-8781",,,,,15,166,171,60,329,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121,,,,,,346,354,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.037,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024/3/8,WOS:000445983800035,View Full Record in Web of Science

The agenda is based on the input of 25 national and international experts which was produced by a novel methodology specifically designed to discuss the key questions relating to the retrofitting of residential buildings. This methodology, based on Problem Tree Analysis, proved an effective method of producing an agenda for the research that is needed to facilitate such change. The research needs are presented under six headings. Stages for undertaking the research activities under each of these headings have been identified. The agenda highlights that the challenge of retrofitting is holistic and includes not just engineering and construction actions but economic, social and governmental requirements. Key aspects of the research agenda include the need for better macroeconomic and micro-economic models and a better understanding of people's needs and expectations.

However, its effects on energy intensity have received little attention. Given the importance of reducing energy intensity, this study advances the understanding of the relationship between intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity by taking advantage of a rich dataset of 40 economies derived from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), spanning across 13 years (1995-2007). A relatively robust causal relationship between intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity has been identified. The qualitative and quantitative interactions of this relationship with income level and sectoral heterogeneity have also been revealed. It is found that the effect of intangible capital on reducing sectoral energy intensity generally diminishes along with increasing income level but a moderate quadratic relationship is identified in some types of intangible capital. Finally, sectors where intangible capital have the largest and smallest effect are also pinpointed.","[Yang, Shenglang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Low Carbon Econ, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore",Australian National University; University of Technology Sydney; Hubei University of Economics; Hubei University of Economics; National University of Singapore,"Yang, SL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",shenglang.yang@gmail.com; xunpeng.shi@gmail.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395",,,,,44,25,25,0,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122,,,,,,118,128,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.027,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,Green Submitted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000447576700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cumulative installed capacity of LE in 2015 was almost four times of that in 2002. Moreover, China has a target of 20% for non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by 2030. LE provides substantial carbon savings in the use phase, but LE infrastructure tends to require more materials than their fossil-fuel electricity counterpart. Here we estimate the carbon 'overhead' from infrastructure expansion during China's transition to LE. We report estimates of the learning curves of the carbon intensity of LE installation, calculated from regional historical data in the period 2002-2012. We combine this information with the predicted cumulative installed capacity from well-known scenarios from national and international bodies. We then project the trends of carbon impacts from LE investments up to 2040. Our results show that, under all scenarios and every year, the annual carbon impact of LE investments never exceeds 4% of China's total carbon emissions, and that the carbon impacts of the expansion in LE infrastructure show either a steady decline or a peak during 2030-2035 before declining further.","[Yuan, Rong; Behrens, Paul; Tukker, Arnold; Rodrigues, Joao F.

According to Scenario 3, the Hubbert Peak uranium production is expected to be reached in 2065 with 4605 t per year. Before the peak, China's uranium demand will grow at the rate of about 7.69% per year, which is about three times the growth rate of production. China's uranium import dependence is estimated to continue to increase. In order to improve uranium resources security, the Chinese government needs to increase investment in uranium ore exploration, encourage private sector's investment in uranium production to promote competition, and improve cooperation with non-uranium mining enterprises for more efficient use of resources. To enhance the country's uranium security, China should establish development funds, accelerate acquisition of uranium enterprises abroad, increase R&D in the unconventional uranium resources such as phosphate mine, and take advantage of price downturn in uranium market to increase strategic reserves.","[Fang, Jianchun] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Fang, Jianchun] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Lu, Zhou] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wanshan] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Huddersfield; Tianjin University of Commerce; Zhejiang University,"Wu, WS (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fangjch@cass.org.cn; c.lau@hud.ac.uk; luzhou59@gmail.com; wuwanshan@zju.edu.cn,"Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; fang, jianchun/0000-0003-0142-8730; Wu, Wanshan/0000-0002-2191-8713",National Social Science Fund of China [16BJY052],National Social Science Fund of China,"We thank anonymous reviewers, editors for their helpful comments and advice.

However, few studies have empirically applied TC analysis to GB incentives, which normally should have analyzed the TCs borne by different stakeholders. These include TC typology and determinants during the implementation process, especially the extra administration process where TCs possibly may be incurred. The lack of such in-depth analysis tends to make incentive-design ignore efficiency and fairness amongst the stakeholders. This study aims to improve the efficiency of GB incentives through analyzing TCs borne by the private sector stakeholders. It would identify TC typologies and determinants, and TCs measurement and allocation to different stakeholders. As TCs are policy context-specific, this paper takes a popular GB incentive scheme, Gross Floor Area (GFA) Concession Scheme, as an example. Interviews were conducted with 20 industry experts to validate TCs types and determinants, and to gauge the magnitude of TCs borne by different stakeholders. These empirical evidences are helpful for policy-makers and practitioners to better understand the impacts of TCs, so as to improve the effectiveness of future incentive schemes. In addition, GB policy recommendations for Hong Kong are proposed and many of which are relevant to other countries.","[Fan, Ke; Chan, Edwin H.

These findings call for a modification of China's growth-oriented urban policy.","[Yang, Zhenshan; Dunford, Michael] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev & Modelling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Dunford, Michael] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Cambridge; University of Sussex","Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev & Modelling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England.",yangzs@igsnrr.ac.cn; m.f.dunford@sussex.ac.uk,"Dunford, Michael/J-8306-2019","Dunford, Michael/0000-0002-0028-3130; Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371008, 41530751]; Early Career Talent Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' [2014042]; Kezhen Program of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS [2016RC101]; CAS programme 'Foreign Visiting Scholar of the CAS' [2017VP01]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Early Career Talent Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'; Kezhen Program of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS; CAS programme 'Foreign Visiting Scholar of the CAS'","The research was sponsored by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41371008 and 41530751], the Early Career Talent Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' [grant number 2014042], the Kezhen Program of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS [grant number 2016RC101], and the support of the CAS programme 'Foreign Visiting Scholar of the CAS' [grant number 2017VP01].",,43,51,62,8,123,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper examines the BRICS' approach to renewable energy cooperation. It argues that, following a robust declaratory intent, implementation has taken time to achieve but there are signs of this coming on-stream. The New Development Bank can provide an effective intervention mechanism for the BRIGS in Africa. New BRICS' policy initiatives suggest a more accelerated approach on renewable energy investment and technological cooperation. However, for the foreseeable future, individual members will be the drivers of the transfer process, particularly China and India. In terms of policy, the BRICS need to elaborate a specific strategy for renewable energy cooperation for both intra-BRICS and extra-BRICE development. Policies should also prioritise their pro-poor rationale and intent to widen energy access, achieve energy equity and overcome energy poverty. China and India have a significant existing and growing capacity to help move this forward.","[Gu, Jing] IDS, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Renwick, Neil] Coventry Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [Xue, Lan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",University of Sussex; Coventry University; Tsinghua University,"Gu, J (通讯作者)，IDS, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",j.gu@ids.ac.uk; n.renwick@coventry.ac.uk; xuelan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development at the Institute of Development Studies,Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development at the Institute of Development Studies,"We would like to acknowledge the support of the Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development at the Institute of Development Studies and the excellent research assistance of Hasina Daya.

Unlike the existing measures, ours are able to detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted mean square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than 6 months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at the 1-month horizon, that can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect.

Methods: A multistage, stratified, clustered random nationally representative Chinese sample was used. The study design followed an adapted UK Measurement and Valuation of Health protocol. Each respondent valued 11 random states plus state 33333 and unconscious using the TTO method in face-to-face interviews. Three types of models were explored: ordinary least squares, general least squares, and weighted least squares models. Results: In total, 5939 inhabitants aged 15 years and older were interviewed. Of these, 5503 satisfactorily interviewed participants were included in constructing models. An ordinary least squares model including 10 dummies without constant and N3 had a mean absolute error of 0.083 and a correlation coefficient of 0.899 between the predicted and mean values. Goodness-of-fit indices of two models based on split subsample were similar. Conclusions: TTO values were higher in our study compared with those in a study carried out in urban areas, which is mirrored by the higher values in rural areas. Several other aspects, in addition to the valuation procedure, might have influenced the results, such as factors beyond demographic factors such as view on life and death and believing in an afterlife, which need further investigation. Future studies using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire should consider using this value set based on a nationally representative sample of the Chinese population.","[Zhuo, Lang; Chen, Jiaying] Nanjing Med Univ, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Lang; Ye, Jingtao] Xuzhou Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ling; Zhang, Yaoguang] Natl Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Ctr Stat & Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sun; Burstrom, Kristina] Karolinska Inst, Hlth Outcomes & Econ Eualuat Res Grp, Stockholm Ctr Healthcare Eth, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sun, Sun] Umea Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, Div Epidemiol & Global Hlth, Umea, Sweden; [Burstrom, Kristina] Karolinska Inst, Equ & Hlth Policy Res Grp, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burstrom, Kristina; Chen, Jiaying] Nanjing Med Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, Longmian Ave 101, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Medical University; Xuzhou Medical University; Karolinska Institutet; Umea University; Karolinska Institutet; Nanjing Medical University,"Chen, JY (通讯作者)，Nanjing Med Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, Longmian Ave 101, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jychen@njmu.edu.cn,"zhang, yuanyuan/GYA-4428-2022; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; sun, sun/JEF-8175-2023; Chen, Jiaying/HDN-5196-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373183],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71373183).,,30,49,57,9,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21,11,,,,,1330,1337,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.04.1370,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.04.1370,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442281,hybrid,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000450111400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a penalized exponentially tilted (PET) likelihood for variable selection and parameter estimation for growing dimensional unconditional moment models in the presence of correlation among variables and model misspecification. Under some regularity conditions, we investigate the consistent and oracle properties of the PET estimators of parameters, and show that the constrained PET likelihood ratio statistic for testing contrast hypothesis asymptotically follows the chi-squared distribution. Theoretical results reveal that the PET likelihood approach is robust to model misspecification. We study high-order asymptotic properties of the proposed PET estimators. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite performance of the proposed methodologies. An example from the Boston Housing Study is illustrated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that the individual slope coefficients are homogeneous within a group and heterogeneous across groups but each individual's group membership is unknown to the researcher. We consider penalized principal component (PPC) estimation by extending the penalized-profile-likelihood-based C-Lasso of Su, Shi, and Phillips (2016) to panel data models with cross section dependence. Given the correct number of groups, we show that the C-Lasso can achieve simultaneous classification and estimation in a single step and exhibit the desirable property of uniform classification consistency. The C-Lasso-based PPC estimators of the group-specific parameters also have the oracle property. BIC-type information criteria are proposed to choose the numbers of factors and groups consistently and to select the data-driven tuning parameter. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We apply our C-Lasso to study the persistence of housing prices in China's large and medium-sized cities in the last decade and identify three groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we propose a data-driven procedure for constructing a class of simultaneous confidence regions for a subset of the entries of a large precision matrix. The confidence regions can be applied to test for specific structures of a precision matrix, and to recover its nonzero components. We first construct an estimator for the precision matrix via penalized node-wise regression. We then develop the Gaussian approximation to approximate the distribution of the maximum difference between the estimated and the true precision coefficients. A computationally feasible parametric bootstrap algorithm is developed to implement the proposed procedure. The theoretical justification is established under the setting which allows temporal dependence among observations. Therefore the proposed procedure is applicable to both independent and identically distributed data and time series data. Numerical results with both simulated and real data confirm the good performance of the proposed method.

Each bidder's privately known type may affect both his risk attitude and the expected value of the asset's return to the winner. An ex post equilibrium in which the winning bidder has the largest willingness to pay for the asset exists if two conditions hold: each bidder's marginal utility of income is log-supermodular, and the vector-valued function mapping the type vector into the bidders' expected values for the asset satisfies a weighted average crossing condition. However, this equilibrium need not be efficient. We show that it is efficient if each bidder's expected value for the asset is nonincreasing in the types of the other bidders, or if the bidders exhibit nonincreasing absolute risk aversion, or if the asset is riskless.

Three key results differ from those in regular models. First, both the threshold point and the threshold effect parameters are shown to be identified without the need for instrumentation. Second, in partially linear threshold models, both parametric and nonparametric components rely on the same data, which prima facie suggests identification failure. But, as shown here, the discontinuity structure of the threshold itself supplies identifying information for the parametric coefficients without the need for extra randomness in the regressors. Third, instrumentation plays different roles in the estimation of the system parameters, delivering identification for the structural coefficients in the usual way, but raising convergence rates for the threshold effect parameters and improving efficiency for the threshold point. Simulation studies corroborate the theory and the asymptotics. An empirical application is conducted to explore the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings, illustrating the relevance of threshold models in treatment effects evaluation in the presence of endogeneity.

Statistically speaking, the Fama-French three factor models imply that the return of an asset can be accounted for directly by the Fama-French three factors, i.e. market, size and value factor, through a linear function. A natural question is: would some kind of transformed Fama-French three factors work better? If so, what kind of transformation should be imposed on each factor in order to make the transformed three factors better account for asset returns? In this paper, we are going to address these questions through nonparametric modelling. We propose a data driven approach to construct the transformation for each factor concerned. A generalised maximum likelihood ratio based hypothesis test is also proposed to test whether transformations on the Fama-French three factors are needed for a given data set. Asymptotic properties are established to justify the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to show how the proposed methods perform with finite sample size. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a real data set, which leads to some interesting findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The literature also shows that the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal when the sample size of the original data considered goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, there is little discussion on the large sample behaviour of the posterior mean. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. In particular, we extend the posterior mean idea to the conditional mean case, which is conditioning on a given vector of summary statistics of the original data. We establish a new asymptotic theory for the conditional mean estimator for the case when both the sample size of the original data concerned and the number of Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations go to infinity. Simulation studies show that this conditional mean estimator has very good finite sample performance. In addition, we employ the conditional mean estimator to estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for S&P 500 stock returns and find that the conditional mean estimator performs better than quasi-maximum likelihood estimation in terms of out-of-sample forecasting.

The test relies on a new characterization of equality between two k dimensional symmetric positive-definite matrices A and B: the traces of AB-1 and BA-1 are equal to k if and only if A = B. Using this simple criterion, we introduce a class of omnibus test statistics for equality and examine their null and local alternative approximations under some mild regularity conditions. A preferred test in the class with good omni-directional power is recommended for practical work. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to explore performance characteristics under the null and local as well as fixed alternatives. The test is applicable in many settings, including GMM estimation, SVAR models and high dimensional variance matrix settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the classical GARCH model, the ZD-GARCH(1, 1) model is always non-stationary regardless of the sign of the Lyapunov exponent gamma(0), but interestingly it is stable with its sample path oscillating randomly between zero and infinity over time when gamma(0) = 0. Furthermore, this paper studies the generalized quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (GQMLE) of the ZD-GARCH(1, 1) model, and establishes its strong consistency and asymptotic normality. Based on the GQMLE, an estimator for gamma(0), a t-test for stability, a unit root test for the absence of the drift term, and a portmanteau test for model checking are all constructed. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and tests. Applications demonstrate that a stable ZD-GARCH(1, 1) model is more appropriate than a non-stationary GARCH(1, 1) model in fitting the KV-A stock returns in Francq and Zakoian (2012).

Bayesian tools are developed to estimate the model, make related inferences, and perform model selection. To construct efficient posterior sampler for the STI model by an approximation approach, a new algorithm called ALSO (Auxiliary Least Squares Optimization) is introduced, which can quickly make sufficient approximation to a given random variable using Gaussian mixture variables. The posterior sampler takes advantages of the BFGS optimization method to tailor the proposal densities in Metropolis-Hastings chains, and is computationally faster than the existing samplers in literature. Simulation shows that the proposed posterior sampler works well for the STI model. To illustrate the use of the STI model in the real world, we analyze two real high frequency data sets associated with two markets. It is found that the estimated daily tail indexes generally follow a time-varying pattern and tend to fall when large negative events occur. Besides, they significantly drop below 2 during some periods, which implies that the variances of the return distributions during those periods may be infinite, and hence any variance-based risk management for the two markets may be questionable.

Apparently in real data these two types of noise co-exist. In this paper, we discover a common feature of these two types of noise and propose a unified volatility estimation approach in the presence of both rounding and random noise. Our data-driven method enjoys superior properties in terms of bias and convergence rate. We establish feasible central limit theorems and show their superior performance via simulations. Empirical studies show clear advantages of our method when applied to both stocks data and currency exchange data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a model selection procedure to choose a weights matrix from several candidates by using a Mallows type criterion. We prove that when the true weights matrix is not in the candidates, the procedure is asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing the squared loss; otherwise, the procedure can select the true weights matrix consistently. We then propose a model averaging procedure to reduce the squared loss. We also provide procedures for the spatial model with heteroscedasticity and endogenous regressors and the model with both spatial lag and spatial error. Monte Carlo experiments show that proposed procedures have satisfactory finite sample performances. We apply the model selection and model averaging procedures to study the market integration in China using historical rice prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the application of the GAM, the link function involved is usually assumed to be a commonly used one without justification. Motivated by a real data example with binary response where the commonly used link function does not work, we propose a generalised additive models with unknown link function (GAMUL) for various types of data, including binary, continuous and ordinal. The proposed estimators are proved to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Semiparametric efficiency of the estimators is demonstrated in terms of their linear functionals. In addition, an iterative algorithm, where all estimators can be expressed explicitly as a linear function of Y, is proposed to overcome the computational hurdle for the GAM type model. Extensive simulation studies conducted in this paper show the proposed estimation procedure works very well. The proposed GAMUL are finally used to analyze a real dataset about loan repayment in China, which leads to some interesting findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The first test is the MCMC version of IOSA test and its asymptotic null distribution is normal. The second test is motivated from the power enhancement technique of Fan et al. (2015). It combines a component (J(1)) that tests a null point hypothesis in an expanded model and a power enhancement component (J(0)) obtained from the first test. It is shown that J(0) converges to zero when the null model is correctly specified and diverges when the null model is misspecified. Also shown is that J(1) is asymptotically chi(2)-distributed, suggesting that the second test is asymptotically pivotal, when the null model is correctly specified. The main feature of the first test is that no alternative model is needed. The second test has several properties. First, its size distortion is small and hence bootstrap methods can be avoided. Second, it is easy to compute from MCMC output and hence is applicable to a wide range of models, including latent variable models for which frequentist methods are difficult to use. Third, when the test statistic rejects the null model and! takes a large value, the test suggests the source of misspecification. The finite sample performance is investigated using simulated data. The method is illustrated in a linear regression model, a linear state-space model, and a stochastic volatility model using real data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To evaluate long-term health status in elderly patients who underwent PCI. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent PCI at a university-affiliated hospital from September 2009 to June 2012 were prospectively enrolled with HRQOL assessment at baseline (up to 2 weeks before PCI) and at 6-, 12-, and 36-month follow-up using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire descriptive profile and visual analogue scale (VAS). Minimally important benefit (MIB) in HRQOL was defined as greater than half an SD improvement in the baseline VAS score. Results: Of 1957 patients, 49.9%, 29.1%, and 21.0% were aged younger than 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and older, respectively. Mean VAS scores at baseline (50.1 +/- 20.5 vs. 51.6 +/- 20.5 vs. 52.6 +/- 21.8; P = 0.09) and at 36 months (72.9 +/- 14.0 vs. 72.8 +/- 16.1 vs. 72.0 +/- 14.8; P = 0.77) were similar between the three age groups, respectively. MIB at 36 months was observed in 65.7%, 61.9%, and 61.2% of patients in each age group, respectively. Proportion of patients aged 75 years and older reporting problems in pain/discomfort and self-care reduced from 91.2% and 24.8% at baseline to 41.4% and 10.1% at 36 months, respectively (both P < 0.01). Independent predictors of MIB in HRQOL at 36 months in patients 75 years and older included poor baseline HRQOL, MIB at 6 months, and presentation with myocardial infarction (all P < 0.01). Conclusions: Elderly patients experienced sustained long-term improvement in quality of life comparable with younger patients after PCI. Our findings suggest that age per se should not deter against revascularization because of sustained benefit in HRQOL.","[Yan, Bryan P.; Chan, Lally L.

Firms post wages to attract workers and matches are endogenous. Reducing the wage relative to the wage previously posted is costly to the firm, where the cost is proportional to the size of the proposed cut. Shocks to the firm's profitability may yield an equilibrium wage above what the firm would offer absent proportional adjustment costs. Wage cuts can be partial or full, immediate or delayed, and are non-linear in the shock size. Importantly, wages are sticky even if firms have negligible costs for cutting wages.

The identification assumption is based on the correlated random effects structure. Under this assumption, the parameters of interest are identified up to a multiplicative constant and could be estimated by an average difference of derivatives estimator based on the local polynomial smoothing. We suggest to linearly combine the estimators obtained for different orders of differences and derive the variance-minimizing weighting scheme. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators is derived both for stationary and non-stationary explanatory variables along with a test of the stationarity. Finally, Monte Carlo experiments reveal finite sample properties of the proposed estimator. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The exact distribution is asymmetric and tri-modal, indicating that the estimator is biased. These two properties are also found in the finite sample distribution of the least squares (LS) estimator of structural break point in the discrete time model, suggesting the classical long-span asymptotic theory is inadequate. The paper then builds a continuous time approximation to the discrete time model and develops an in-fill asymptotic theory for the LS estimator. The in-fill asymptotic distribution is asymmetric and tri-modal and delivers good approximations to the finite sample distribution. To reduce the bias in the estimation of both the continuous time and the discrete time models, a simulation-based method based on the indirect estimation (IE) approach is proposed. Monte Carlo studies show that IE achieves substantial bias reductions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To generate these value sets, researchers first collect values for a subset of preselected health states from a panel representing the general public, and then use a prediction algorithm to generate values for all 243 states. High prevalence of a health state in daily practice has historically been a key criterion in selecting a subset of health states as the observed set. More recently, other criteria have been suggested, especially approaches based on statistical criteria such as randomization and orthogonality. Objectives: To evaluate the validity and accuracy of both the earlier and newer criteria, in terms of prediction of values for all the health states and of the values of common health states in particular. Methods: We used a pre-existing data set that contained visual analogue scale values from 126 students, each of whom valued all 243 EQ-5D-3L states. Then, we generated a series of designs and subsequently modeled the data with respect to each design. Some of these designs were used in the past; for example, the Measurement and Valuation of Health approach was included. Others were newly generated. The performance of different designs was evaluated in terms of the lowest root mean squared error for all health states taken together, and separately for common and rare states. Classification as common or rare was based on the frequency of the states' occurrence in three patient and population data sets pooled together (N = 5269). Results: The orthogonal design with 54 health states produced the lowest root mean squared errors. Over-representation of common health states in a design did not improve the estimations for these states. The published designs performed the worst, whereas the random selection designs were good on average. Nevertheless, the performance of the random selection designs showed more variance compared with orthogonal designs, because some of the former designs did not display appropriate balance. Conclusions: The published designs gave rise to large estimation errors for the extrapolated EQ-5D-3L health states. The orthogonal design focusing on statistical efficiency showed its superiority. Overall, when weighing up design properties, increased statistical efficiency outweighs an increased error rate, if any, in rare health states.","[Yang, Zhihao; Bonsel, Gouke; Busschbach, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Med Ctr, Na 2019,80 Wytemaweg, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Yang, Zhihao] Guizhou Med Univ, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Bonsel, Gouke; Stolk, Elly] EuroQol Off, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Guizhou Medical University; National University of Singapore,"Yang, ZH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Med Ctr, Na 2019,80 Wytemaweg, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands.",z.yang@erasmusmc.nl,"Busschbach, Jan/P-1584-2019","Busschbach, Jan/0000-0002-8602-0381",,,,,30,25,25,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21,4,,,,,456,461,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.001,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680103,hybrid,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000430442800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: A discrete choice experiment survey with a two-alternative study design was developed. Data were collected from pediatric specialist outpatient clinics from 482 mothers with daughters aged between 8 and 17 years. Preferences of the four attributes of HPV vaccines (protection against cervical cancer, protection duration, side effects, and out-of-pocket costs) were evaluated. The marginal and overall WTP were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. A subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the impact of socioeconomic factors on mothers' WTP. Results: Side effects, protection against cervical cancer, protection duration, and out-of-pocket cost determined the decision to receive or not receive the vaccine. All attributes had a statistically significant effect on the preference of and the WTP for the vaccine. Maximum WTP for ideal vaccines (i.e., 100% protection, lifetime protection duration, and 0% side effects) was HK$8976 (US $1129). The estimated WTP for vaccines currently available was HK$1620 (US $208), lower than the current market price. Among those who had a monthly household income of more than HK$100,000 (US $12,821), the WTP for vaccines currently offered was higher than the market price. Conclusions: This study provides new data on how features of the HPV vaccine are viewed and valued by mothers by determining their perception of ideal or improved and current vaccine technologies.

This work investigates two types of state laws that regulate the procedures under which pharmacists substitute bioequivalent generic versions of brand name drugs. Mandatory substitution laws require pharmacists to use the generic as a default, and presumed consent laws allow them to assume that the patient agrees to the substitution. Both situations can be overruled by the patient. Using plausibly exogenous changes in states' laws, we use difference-in-differences and a discrete choice model to show that although the mandatory switching laws have little effect, the presumed consent laws reduce consumers' probability of purchasing brand name drugs by 3.2% points. The differential effectiveness of the laws is likely caused by pharmacists' profit motives. These results offer important implications for policies that seek to reduce drug expenditures by incentivizing the use of generic drugs.","[Song, Yan] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Huangpu Ave 601, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Barthold, Douglas] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcome Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Jinan University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Huangpu Ave 601, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",kprinceing@gmail.com,"Song, Yan/O-8528-2019","Song, Yan/0000-0002-8669-4116","McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team [HOA-80072l]; CIHR [MOP 93546]; Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award; WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging [P01AG033559]; National Institutes of Health [R01HL126804, R01HL130642]",McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team, Grant/Award Number: HOA-80072l; CIHR Operating, Grant/Award Number: MOP 93546; Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award; WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging, Grant/Award Number: P01AG033559; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Numbers: R01HL126804 and R01HL130642",,36,24,30,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27,11,,,,,1717,1737,,10.1002/hec.3796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3796,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29992674,Green Accepted,,,2024/3/8,WOS:000446323300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results suggest that being an only child increases the incidence of myopia by 9.1 percentage points. We further investigate the mechanisms through which being an only child affects the myopia and find that only children, as the only hope in a household, receive higher expectations in terms of academic performance and future educational attainment and pressure to succeed in life from parents, which contribute to the increased myopia. We also find that the school quality of only children is significantly higher than that of non-only children.

A number of possible elements, including ordering effects of the valuation tasks, mistakes at the sorting question, and interviewers' (learning) effects, may contribute to their inconsistency. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two modifications on consistency of TTO data in The Netherlands (NL) and Hong Kong (HK): (1) separating the valuation of the Better than Dead (BTD) and Worse than Dead (WTD) states; and (2) Implementation of feedback (FB) module by offering an opportunity to review TTO responses. Methods: A crossover design with two study arms was used to test the effect of the modifications. In each jurisdiction, six interviewers were involved where half the interviewers started using the standard version, and the other half started with the split version. Each version was switched after every 25 (NL) or 30 (HK) interviews until 400 interviews were completed. Results: In the NL and HK, 404 and 403 respondents participated, respectively. With the use of the FB module, the proportion of respondents with inconsistent responses was lowered from 17.8% to 10.6% (P < 0.001) in NL and from 31.8% to 22.3% (P = 0.003) in HK. The result of separating the valuation of BTD and WTD states was not straightforward because it reduced the inconsistency rate in NL but not in HK. Conclusions: The results support implementation of the FB module to promote the consistency of the data. The separation of the BTD and WTD task is not supported.

The test statistic is a weighted version of the integrated squared difference between the restricted and unrestricted estimators of the joint characteristic function of nonparametric residuals and explanatory variables, whose critical values are estimated with the assistance of a bootstrap technique. The test is sensitive to local alternatives converging to the null at the parametric rate T-1/2, with T the sample size. We investigate the finite sample performance of the test by means of Monte Carlo experiments and two empirical applications to test whether losses are more likely than gains in financial markets, and whether expansions and contractions are equally likely in business cycles, given the relevant information.

Since the integrated volatility matrix often has entries with a wide range of variability, universal thresholding estimators do not take the varying entries into consideration and may have unsatisfactory performances. This paper investigates adaptive thresholding estimation of the large integrated volatility matrix. We first construct an estimator for the asymptotic variance of the pre-averaging realized volatility estimator and then use the two estimators to develop an adaptive thresholding estimator of the large volatility matrix. It is shown that the adaptive thresholding estimator can achieve the optimal rate of convergence over the class of the sparse integrated volatility matrix when both the number of assets and sample size are allowed to go to infinity, while the universal thresholding estimator can achieve only the sub-optimal convergence rate. Also we discuss how to harness the adaptive thresholding scheme in the approximate factor model. The simulation study is conducted to check the finite sample performance of the adaptive thresholding estimators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Details of decision-making processes including the new drug listing submission, Drug Advisory Committee (DAC) meeting, and procedures prior to and following the meeting, were extracted from the official Hong Kong Hospital Authority drug formulary management website and manual. Publicly-available information related to the new drug decision-making process for five HTA agencies [the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), the Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC)] were reviewed and retrieved from official documents from public domains. The DAC is in charge of systemically and critically appraising new drugs before they are listed on the formulary, reviewing submitted applications, and making the decision to list the drug based on scientific evidence to which safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness are the primary considerations. When compared with other HTA agencies, transparency of the decision-making process of the DAC, the relevance of clinical and health economic evidence, and the lack of health economic and methodological input of submissions are the major challenges to the new-drug listing policy in Hong Kong. Despite these challenges, this review provides suggestions for the establishment of a more transparent, credible, and evidence-based decision-making process in the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. Proposals for improvement in the listing of new drugs in the formulary should be a priority of healthcare reforms.","[Wong, Carlos King Ho] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Family Med & Primary Care, Ap Lei Chau Clin, 3-F,161 Ap Lei Chau Main St, Ap Lei Chau, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Carlos King Ho; Wu, Olivia] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, 1 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Cheung, Bernard M.

However, an undesirable feature of a high dimensional factor model is that the model has too many parameters. An effective way to address this issue, proposed in a seminar work by Tsai and Tsay (2010) is to decompose the loadings matrix by a high-dimensional known matrix multiplying with a low-dimensional unknown matrix, which Tsai and Tsay (2010) name the constrained factor models. This paper investigates the estimation and inferential theory of constrained factor models under large-N and large-T setup, where N denotes the number of cross sectional units and T the time periods. We propose using the quasi maximum likelihood method to estimate the model and investigate the asymptotic properties of the quasi maximum likelihood estimators, including consistency, rates of convergence and limiting distributions. A new statistic is proposed for testing the null hypothesis of constrained factor models against the alternative of standard factor models. Partially constrained factor models are also investigated. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that the quasi maximum likelihood estimators and the proposed new statistic perform well in finite samples. We also consider the extension to an approximate constrained factor model where the idiosyncratic errors are allowed to be weakly dependent processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We employ double asymptotics under which both the cross-sectional sample size and the length of time series tend to infinity and utilize the sieve AR approximation with its lag order increasing with the sample size. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the fixed effects estimator and propose a bias-corrected fixed effects estimator based on a theoretical asymptotic bias term.

Using the distribution of recurrence intervalsthe waiting time between consecutive extremeswe show that these extreme returns are predictable in the short term. Examining a range of different types of returns and thresholds we find that recurrence intervals follow a q-exponential distribution, which we then use to theoretically derive the hazard probability http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink. Maximizing the usefulness of extreme forecasts to define an optimized hazard threshold, we indicate a financial extreme occurring within the next day when the hazard probability is greater than the optimized threshold. Both in-sample tests and out-of-sample predictions indicate that these forecasts are more accurate than a benchmark that ignores the predictive signals. This recurrence interval finding deepens our understanding of reoccurring extreme returns and can be applied to forecast extremes in risk management.","[Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Ctr Finance & Investment Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Wang, Gang-Jin; Canabarro, Askery; Stanley, H.

Instead of requiring the existence of strictly consistent price systems as in the literature, we show that strictly consistent local martingale systems (SCLMS) can successfully serve as the dual elements such that the market viability can be verified. We introduce two weaker notions of no arbitrage conditions on market models named no unbounded profit with bounded risk (NUPBR) and no local arbitrage with bounded portfolios (NLABPs). In particular, we show that the NUPBR and NLABP conditions in the robust sense are equivalent to the existence of SCLMS for general market models. We also discuss the implications for the utility maximization problem.","[Bayraktar, Erhan] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yu, Xiang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Bayraktar, E (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",erhan@umich.edu,"BAYRAKTAR, ERHAN/E-6018-2011","BAYRAKTAR, ERHAN/0000-0002-1926-4570; YU, Xiang/0000-0003-4053-7876",National Science Foundation [DMS-1613170]; Susan M.

Despite the apparent importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in modern empirical work is to largely ignore it by reporting average partial effects (or, at best, average effects for some groups). While average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects-a collection of estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by percentiles. By construction, the sorted effect curves completely represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap.

This allows us to determine optimal reinsurance from joint interests of the insurer and the reinsurer, which is rarely considered in the continuous-time setting. In the Stackelberg game, the reinsurer moves first and the insurer does subsequently to achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium toward optimal reinsurance arrangement. Speaking more precisely, the reinsurer is the leader of the game and decides on an optimal reinsurance premium to charge, while the insurer is the follower of the game and chooses an optimal proportional reinsurance to purchase. Under utility maximization criteria, we study the game problem starting from the general setting with generic utilities and random coefficients to the special case with exponential utilities and constant coefficients. In the special case, we find that the reinsurer applies the variance premium principle to calculate the optimal reinsurance premium and the insurer's optimal ceding/retained proportion of insurance risk depends not only on the risk aversion of itself but also on that of the reinsurer.","[Chen, Lv] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Chen, Lv] East China Normal Univ, Sch Stat, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yang] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3P 1P3, Canada",University of Waterloo; East China Normal University; York University - Canada,"Shen, Y (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3P 1P3, Canada.",yangshen@yorku.ca,"Shen, Yang/Y-6348-2019","Shen, Yang/0000-0002-0559-2231",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2016-05677]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11501211],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors thank the two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We work under a complex realistic environment: The surplus process is described by a jump-diffusion model and the financial market contains a market index, a risk-free asset, and a pair of mispriced stocks, where the expected return rate of the stocks and the mispricing follow mean reverting stochastic processes which take into account liquidity constraints. The insurer is allowed to purchase reinsurance and to invest in the financial market. We formulate an optimal robust reinsurance-investment problem under the assumption that the insurer is ambiguity-averse to the uncertainty from the financial market and to the uncertainty of the insured's claims. Ambiguity aversion is an aversion to the uncertainty taken by making investment decisions based on a misspecified model. By employing the dynamic programming approach, we derive explicit formulae for the optimal robust reinsurance-investment strategy and the optimal value function. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of some parameters on the optimal strategy and on utility loss functions. Among our various practical findings and recommendations, we find that strengthened market liquidity significantly increases the demand for hedging from the mispriced market, to take advantage of the statistical arbitrage it affords.

In 2009, the Chinese government launched a series of measures to de-incentivise over-prescription in public health facilities, including decoupling the link between facility income and the sale of medicines. Objectives We evaluated the effects of these measures on procurement costs and the volume of antibiotics in county public hospitals. Methods The study was undertaken in the Hubei province of China, where 64 county public hospitals implemented the reform in sequence at three different stages. A quasi-natural experiment design was employed. We performed generalised linear regressions with a difference-in-differences approach using 22,713 procurement records of antibiotics from November 2014 to December 2016. Results The regression results showed that the reform contributed to a 14.79% increase in total costs for antibiotics (p = 0.013), particularly costs for injectable antibiotics (p = 0.022) and first-line antibiotics (p = 0.030). The procurement prices for antibiotics remained largely comparable to those in the control group, but the reform led to a 17.30% increase in the procurement volume (expressed as defined daily doses) of second-line antibiotics (p = 0.032). Conclusions County public hospitals procured more antibiotics and greater numbers of expensive antibiotics, such as those administered via injection, to compensate for the loss of income from the sale of medicines, leading to an increased total cost of antibiotics.","[Tang, Yuqing; Liu, Junjie; Zhang, Xinping] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chaojie] La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Kingsbury Dr, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Zuo, Keyuan] Hubei Publ Resource Trading Ctr, 252 Zhongbei Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; La Trobe University,"Zhang, XP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zuo, KY (通讯作者)，Hubei Publ Resource Trading Ctr, 252 Zhongbei Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xpzhang602@hust.edu.cn; 418754084@qq.com,"Liu, Chaojie/Q-6915-2018","Liu, Chaojie/0000-0003-0877-0424; Zhang, Xinping/0000-0002-0688-2417",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704058],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant number 71704058.

We find that takeover bids with higher M&A Indices are more likely to succeed. Moreover, the M&A Index shows a strong and positive relation with the acquirers' post-acquisition stock performance in the short run and operating performance in the long run. After constructing three portfolios under a buy-and-hold strategy, we find that efficient portfolios with the highest indices earn higher equity returns and monthly alphas than inefficient portfolios with the lowest indices.

The market efficiency and the price discovery of Chinese stock index futures do not deteriorate after these rule changes. Using variance ratio and spectral shape tests, we find that the Chinese index futures market becomes even more efficient after the tightened rules came into effect. Furthermore, by employing Schwarz and Szakmary [J. Futures Markets, 1994, 14(2), 147-167] and Hasbrouck [J. Finance, 1995, 50(4), 1175-1199] price discovery measures, we find that the price discovery function, to some extent, becomes better. This finding is consistent with Stein [J.

Stud., 2014, 27(3), 747-789.], who finds that price discovery can be improved with reduced liquidity. It also suggests that the new rules may effectively regulate the manipulation behaviour of the Chinese stock index futures market during a bad market state, and then positively affect its market efficiency and price discovery function.","[Lin, Hai] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Wang, You] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Victoria University Wellington; Xiamen University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",15620140154066@stu.xmu.edu.cn,,,China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We thank the anonymous referee, Toby Daglish and seminar participants at Victoria University of Wellington, the 2017 New Zealand Finance Colloquium, and the Fifth International Conference on Futures and Other Derivatives for constructive comments.

In order to achieve that, three NNs, namely the Multi-Layer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network and the Psi Sigma Network (PSN), are applied to the task of forecasting the daily returns of three Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The statistical and trading performance of the NNs is benchmarked with the traditional Autoregressive Moving Average models. Next, a novel dynamic asymmetric copula model (NNC) is introduced in order to capture the dependence structure across ETF returns. Based on the above, weekly re-balanced portfolios are obtained and compared using the traditional mean-variance and the mean-CVaR portfolio optimization approach. In terms of the results, PSN outperforms all models in statistical and trading terms. Additionally, the asymmetric skewed t copula statistically outperforms symmetric copulas when it comes to modelling ETF returns dependence. The proposed NNC model leads to significant improvements in the portfolio optimization process, while forecasting covariance accounting for asymmetric dependence between the ETFs also improves the performance of obtained portfolios.","[Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Stasinakis, Charalampos; Sermpinis, Georgios] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shi, Yukun] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ken Edwards Bldg, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; University of Glasgow; University of Leicester,"Stasinakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Charalampos.Stasinakis@glas-gow.ac.uk,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; Sermpinis, Georgios/0000-0002-7341-8913",,,,,57,9,9,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The precise mathematical formulation of SR is still scrutinised, but the main purpose is to evaluate the financial distress of a system as a result of the failure of one component of the financial system in question. Many of the mathematical definitions of SR are based on evaluating expectations in extreme regions and therefore, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) represents the key ingredient in producing valuable estimates of SR and even its decomposition per individual components of the entire system. Without doubt, the prescribed dependence model amongst the system components has a major impact over our asymptotic approximations. Thus, this paper considers various well-known dependence models in the EVT literature that allow us to generate SR estimates. Our findings reveal that SR has a significant impact under asymptotic dependence, while weak tail dependence, known as asymptotic independence, produces an insignificant loss over the regulatory capital.","[Asimit, Alexandru V.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",City University London; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",asimit@city.ac.uk; lijinzhu@nankai.edu.cn,"Asimit, Vali/ABC-9324-2022; Li, Jinzhu/F-8687-2010","Asimit, Vali/0000-0002-7706-0066;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11371020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors are very grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their thorough reading of the paper and constructive suggestions.

Based on the analysis of the martingale problem, we introduce the notion of weak solution for stochastic differential equations under nonlinear expectations and obtain an existence theorem under the Lipschitz continuity condition of the coefficients. The approach to establish the existence of weak solutions generalizes the classical Girsanov transformation method in that it no longer requires the two (probability) measures to be absolutely continuous.","[Guo, Xin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pan, Chen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore; [Peng, Shige] Shandong Univ, Sch Math, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; Shandong University,"Pan, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore.",xinguo@berkeley.edu; huoshanpc@126.com; peng@sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

We empirically evaluate the proposed framework using four commonly used data-sets.

Monte Carlo experiments show that the tests perform well except for when crisis periods are short in duration. Small crisis sample critical values are calculated for use in this case. In an empirical application involving the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the results show that significant contagion effects are widespread from the US banking sector to global equity markets and banking sectors through either the co-kurtosis or the co-volatility channels, reinforcing that higher order moments matter during crises.","[Fry-McKibbin, Renee; Hsiao, Cody Yu-Ling] CAMA, Macau, Peoples R China; [Fry-McKibbin, Renee] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hsiao, Cody Yu-Ling] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Hsiao, CYL (通讯作者)，CAMA, Macau, Peoples R China.;Hsiao, CYL (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China.",ylhsiao@must.edu.mo,,"Fry-McKibbin, Renee/0000-0003-2396-7540; Hsiao, Cody Yu Ling/0000-0003-3754-0505",ARC [DP120103443],ARC(Australian Research Council),We grate fully acknowledge funding from ARC grant DP120103443.,,39,32,32,2,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

For natural events as relevant in applications, such a symmetry and corresponding control are usually absent, precluding traditional measurement methods. This paper introduces two indexes of ambiguity attitudes, one for aversion and the other for insensitivity/perception, for which we can control for likelihood beliefs even if these are unknown. Hence, we can now measure ambiguity attitudes for natural events. Our indexes are valid under many ambiguity theories, do not require expected utility for risk, and are easy to elicit in practice. We use our indexes to investigate time pressure under ambiguity. People do not become more ambiguity averse under time pressure but become more insensitive (perceive more ambiguity). These findings are plausible and, hence, support the validity of our indexes.","[Baillon, Aurelien; Selim, Asli; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Huang, Zhenxing] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenxing] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Baillon, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Baillon@ese.eur.nl; ybhzxadam@gmail.com; asliselim@gmail.com; Wakker@ese.eur.nl,"Baillon, Aurélien/E-6961-2012","Baillon, Aurélien/0000-0002-0169-9760",China National Science Foundation [71703091]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [452-13-013],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Roy Kouwenberg, Chen Li, Thorsten Pachur, Martijn van den Assem, and four anonymous referees made helpful comments.

It has been shown that the identification of the regression function from the conditional expectation of the dependent variable on the instrument relies on the completeness of the distribution of the endogenous regressor conditional on the instrument, i.e., f (x vertical bar z). We show that (1) if the deviation of the conditional density f (x vertical bar z(k)) from a known complete sequence of functions is less than a sequence of values determined by the complete sequence in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0), then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete, and (2) if the conditional density f (x vertical bar z) can form a linearly independent sequence {f (. vertical bar z(k)) : k = 1,2,...} in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0) and its relative deviation from a known complete sequence of functions under some norm is finite then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete.

Consider the model y(t) = beta(1yt-1) I {t <= k(0)} + beta I2yt-1 {t > k(0)}+ epsilon t, t = 1,2, ..., T, where I {.} denotes the indicator function, one of beta(1) and beta(2) depends on the sample size T, and the other is equal to one. We examine four cases: Case (I): beta(1) = beta(1T) = 1-c/k(T), beta(2) = 1; (II): beta(1) = 1, beta(2) = beta(2T) = 1-c/k(T); (III): beta(1) = 1, beta(2) = beta(2T) = 1+ c/k(T); and case (IV): beta(1) = beta(1T) = 1+ c/k(T), beta(2) = 1, where c is a fixed positive constant, and k(T) is a sequence of positive constants increasing to infinity such that k(T) = o(T). We derive the limiting distributions of the t-ratios of beta(1) and beta(2) and the least squares estimator of the change point for the cases above under some mild conditions.

From the cyclic monotonicity property, we derive identifying inequalities without requiring any shape restrictions for the distribution of the random utility shocks. These inequalities point identify model parameters under straightforward assumptions on the covariates.

Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of various procedures in terms of exact coverage rates and lengths of the confidence intervals. These include the procedures of Bai (1997) based on the asymptotic distribution under a shrinking shift framework, Elliott and Muller (2007) based on inverting a test locally invariant to the magnitude of break, Eo and Morley (2015) based on inverting a likelihood ratio test, and various bootstrap procedures. On the basis of achieving an exact coverage rate that is closest to the nominal level, Elliott and Muller's (2007) approach is by far the best one. However, this comes with a very high cost in terms of the length of the confidence intervals. When the errors are serially correlated and dealing with a change in intercept or a change in the coefficient of a stationary regressor with a high signal-to-noise ratio, the length of the confidence interval increases and approaches the whole sample as the magnitude of the change increases. The same problem occurs in models with a lagged dependent variable, a common case in practice. This drawback is not present for the other methods, which have similar properties.

In order to provide more realistic traffic data for estimations of environmental impacts, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models have been adopted in transportation planning and traffic management models concerning environmental sustainability. This review summarizes and examines the recent methodological advances of DTA models in environmentally sustainable road transportation applications including traffic signal control concerning vehicular emissions and emission pricing. A classification of emission estimation models and their integration with DTA models are accordingly reviewed as supplementary to the existing reviews. Finally, a variety of future research prospects of DTA for environmentally sustainable road transportation research are discussed. In particular, this review also points out that at present the research about DTA models in conjunction with noise predictive models is relatively deficient. (C) 2018 The Authors.

There are a hinterland container operator who is in charge of the hinterland container transportation and an ocean carrier who has an empty container depot at the sea container terminal. We utilize a two stage game model to describe the ocean carrier's decision about the container's free detention time and the hinterland container operator's decision about the time when should an arrived empty container at the inland terminal be dispatched to the sea terminal. Optimal delivery policy of the empty container and the ocean carrier's optimal free detention time are derived. It is shown that the decentralized system does not guarantee system coordination all the time.

Adapted from the shooting heuristic proposed by Zhou et al. (2017) and Ma et al. (2017), this model confines each vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise quadratic function with no more than five pieces and lets all trajectories in the same platoon share identical acceleration and deceleration rates. Similar to the shooting heuristic, the proposed simplified model is able to control the overall smoothness of a platoon of connected automated vehicles and approximately optimize traffic performance in terms of fuel efficiency and driving comfort. While the shooting heuristic relies on numerical meta-heuristic algorithms that cannot ensure solution optimality, we discover a set of elegant theoretical properties for the general objective function and the associated constraints in the proposed simplified model, and consequentially propose an efficient analytical algorithm for solving this problem to the exact optimum. Interestingly, this exact algorithm has intuitive physical interpretations, i.e., stretching the transitional parts of the trajectories (i.e., parts with acceleration and deceleration adjustments) as far as they reach the upstream end of the investigated segment, and then balancing the acceleration and deceleration magnitudes as close as possible. This analytical exact model can be considered as a core module to a range of general trajectory optimization problems at various infrastructure settings. Numerical examples reveal that this exact algorithm has much more efficient computational performance and the same or better solution quality compared with the previously proposed shooting heuristic. These examples also illustrate how to apply this model to CAV control problems on signalized segments and at non-stop intersections. Further, we study a homogeneous special case of this model and analytically formulate the relationship between queue propagation and trajectory smoothing. One counter-intuitive finding is that trajectory smoothing may not always cause longer queue propagation but instead may mitigate queue propagation with appropriate settings. This theoretical finding has valuable implications to joint optimization of queuing management and traffic smoothing in complex transportation networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, appropriate EV rebalancing operations can satisfy user reservations with limited resources and effectively save system investments. This paper proposes an integrated framework that can determine the optimal allocation plan of EVs and staff on the strategic level while considering the operational EV relocation and staff relocation decisions, in order to minimize the total cost, including the EV and staff investment, EV rebalancing and staff relocation costs. In this framework, the dispatching routes of EVs and staff are represented by two sets of space-time paths in the planning time horizon by using a space-time network representation, and the considered problem is then formulated into a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). This model explicitly considers (1) the satisfaction of time-dependent user reservations through dynamically rebalancing EVs and relocating staff to keep the service quality of carsharing system, and (2) the EV battery capacity with limited traveling distance and the charging process of EVs at parking stations. A Lagrangian relaxation-based solution approach is developed to decompose the primal problem into several sets of computationally efficient subproblems. In order to generate good-quality solutions, we also propose a three-phase implementing algorithm based on dynamic programming according to the values of Lagrangian multipliers. An illustrative numerical example and a real-world case study (based on the operation data of Seattle, WA) are conducted to verify the applicability of the formulated model and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Existing studies related to FFC mainly focus on the analysis of operational management and user preferences. Efforts to model the dynamic choices of free-floating shared cars (SCs) in individuals' daily multi-modal multi-activity trip chains have still been rare. This study proposes a tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model of activity-travel scheduling that formulates free-floating SC as an alternative transport mode for conducting daily activities. The model embeds the choice of SC into daily trip chains by extending the state-of-the-art multi-state supernetwork representation. The dynamic traffic flows and supply-demand interactions of SCs are captured endogenously. Moreover, traveler heterogeneity and different pricing schemes are taken into account. A path-flow swapping method is suggested to solve the tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model. Numerical examples of various scenarios demonstrate that fleet size, distribution, and rental-parking price of FFC significantly influence the choice of SC and activity travel pattern.

The majority of TTR measures rely on the travel time percentile function as a basic element for performance evaluation. There are two main approaches for deriving the travel time percentile function: simple unimodal probability distribution models and mixture/nonparametric models. Despite the tractability of the former approach, they cannot sufficiently capture the travel time distributions (TTDs) due to their heterogeneity, and also often encounters many issues such as the failure of significance tests and the indecisiveness among multiple fitted distributions. On the other hand, the latter approach possesses greater flexibility for capturing diverse TTDs, but it does not have a simple and closed-form travel time percentile function. Motivated by the above drawbacks, this paper proposes a closed-form and flexible approach for estimating the travel time percentile function of diverse TTDs based on the Cornish-Fisher expansion without the need to assume/fit a certain distribution type. To ensure a high-quality estimation, we introduce and integrate two improvements with theoretically proven foundation into the Cornish-Fisher expansion while guaranteeing a closed-form expression of the travel time percentile function. Specifically, the first improvement, logarithm transformation, increases the probability of satisfying the validity domain of the Cornish-Fisher expansion; while the second improvement, rearrangement, guarantees a monotone travel time percentile function when travel time datasets cannot satisfy the validity domain after the logarithm transformation. Realistic travel time datasets are used to examine the accuracy and robustness of the pro-posed method. Compared to five widely-used probability distributions, the proposed method is sufficiently adaptable to estimating percentile function of diverse TTDs with lower estimation error. More importantly, it has a closed-form expression of the travel time percentile function, which would facilitate characterizing TTR in large-scale network applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In real world, both the MFD and demand however suffer from various intrinsic uncertainties while travel demand is of time-varying nature. Hence, robust control for traffic networks with uncertain MFDs and demand is much appealing and of greater interest in practice. In literature, there would be a lack of robust control strategies for the problem. One major hurdle is of requirement on model linearization that is actually a basis of most existing results. The main objective of this paper is to explore a new robust perimeter control framework for dynamic traffic networks with parameter uncertainty (on the MFD) and exogenous disturbance induced by travel demand. The disturbance in question is in general time-varying and stochastic. Our main contribution focuses on developing a control-Lyapunov function (CLF) based approach to establishing a couple of universal control laws, one is almost smooth and the other is Bang-bang like, for different implementation scenarios. Moreover, it is indicated that the almost smooth control is more suited for road pricing while the Bang-bang like control for signal timing. In sharp contrast to existing methods, in which adjusting extensive design parameters are usually needed, the proposed methods can determine the control in an automatic manner. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that the control can drive the system dynamics towards a desired equilibrium under various scenarios with uncertain MFDs and travel demand. Both stability and robustness can be substantially observed. As a major consequence, the proposed methods achieve not only global asymptotic stability but also appealing robustness for the closed-loop traffic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of sequential treatment regimens for mRCC and associated adverse events (AEs) from the Chinese payers' perspective. Methods: Key inputs included in the calculation were patient population, dosing information, incidence rates and associated costs of Grade 3/4 AEs, treatment costs (including drug discount programs), and patients' progression-free survival (PFS) as a proxy for length of treatment. To calculate PFS, this study identified pivotal clinical trials and generated a reconstructed individual patient data set from the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The median PFS from the pooled estimates were used in the calculation. In the base-case scenario, sunitinib was used as first line and the other three therapies were used as second line. Sensitivity analyses were conducted where (1) sorafenib was used as first line, or (2) a third-line therapy was added to the base-case scenario. Results: In the base case, the cost per patient per treatment month (PPPM) cost was the lowest for sunitinib + axitinib among all sequential regimens ( yen 14,898) and was the highest for sunitinib + sorafenib ( yen 20,103). If sorafenib is used as first line, everolimus had lower per patient per months (PPPM) cost than axitinib ( yen 17,046 vs yen 23,337), but also had shorter PFS (13.5 months vs 15 months). Second sensitivity analysis with an additional third-line therapy showed consistent results with the base-case scenario; axitinib as second line was the least costly. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, for mRCC sequential treatment, sunitinib followed by axitinib generates the highest cost savings from the Chinese payers' perspective. Future studies are warranted to examine the cost-effectiveness of various mRCC treatment regimens in Chinese populations.","[Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Dept Urol, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Dept Oncol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Park, Sang Hee; Xue, Mei; Gao, Xin] Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ren, Hongye] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Dong, Peng] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Pharmerit North America LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Gao, X (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",cgao@pharmerit.com,"lu, xl/HDO-8340-2022; Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013",,"Pfizer, Inc.","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was funded by Pfizer, Inc.",,51,14,17,5,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A bi-objective model is investigated to minimize both fare increases of the congested stations, while alleviating their boarding/alighting congestion to a certain level simultaneously. The existence of the unique Pareto-optimal solution is proven mathematically in the absence of explicit demand functions.

Secondly, with two competing manufacturers, both are more likely to decentralize in equilibrium when their technologies are more polluting. Under certain conditions, decentralized manufacturers may enjoy higher profits thanks to tax cuts without affecting social welfare or consumer surplus.

A gravity-type model for origin-destination (OD) demand estimation is first presented and calibrated based on the current cargo volumes of the Indonesian maritime market. A model for maximizing total social welfare is then proposed to design the shipping network with cargo demand levels forecasted for future years. The results show that for the Indonesian maritime market, a hub-and-spoke network with fully connected hub ports is better than a network with sequentially connected hub ports in terms of total social welfare. The optimal choices for the international gateway and domestic hub ports vary as cargo demand increases over time. The results suggest that a progressive policy can be promising for infrastructure investments in developing countries: government planning and regulations may be introduced in early years to enhance infrastructure utilization and economic return. With increased demand the market may be liberalized to promote healthy competition.","[Tu, Ningwen; Li, Zhi-Chun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Adiputranto, Dimas; Fu, Xiaowen] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Sydney,"Li, ZC (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",smzcli@gmail.com,"li, zhi-chun/F-9865-2011","li, zhi-chun/0000-0002-1451-0904; Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71525003, 71222107]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13 ZD175]; Huazhong University of Science and Technology [5001300001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017KFKJXX003]; University of Sydney; Sydney Southeast Asia Center, Australia","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); University of Sydney(University of Sydney); Sydney Southeast Asia Center, Australia","We are grateful to three anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier version of the paper.

The known apparatus in transportation research offers several opportunities to estimate panel effects for well-known and widely applied models such as hazard and dynamic logit models. However, the transportation research community is not endowed with a rich set of methods to account for panel effects in dynamic probabilistic decision trees, which have been used as a formalism for the representation of decision heuristics. Building on scarce prior work in statistics, we elaborate an approach to estimate panel effects in dynamic probabilistic decision trees with multinomial action states. Given that panel data naturally have a hierarchical structure with repeated measures nested within individuals, we implement a mixed-effects model that simultaneously accounts for population-level effects (fixed effects), between-individual variances (random effects), and within-individual variances (autocorrelations). The approach uses an iterative estimation procedure between CHAID-based probabilistic tree induction and Bayesian generalized linear mixture modeling (GLMM). When extracting the dynamic probabilistic decision trees, it is assumed that the random effects are known, while it is assumed that the fixed effects are known when estimating the Bayesian GLMM. This iterative process continues until convergence is reached. A Monte Carlo technique is used to navigate between aggregate choice probabilities and individual level multinomial choices. We also test the significance of temporal autocorrelation within individuals. The suggested approach is illustrated using charging station choice of users of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV). Results support the potential value of the suggested approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

With advances in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, CAV trajectories not only provide more information than existing infrastructure-based detection systems, but also can be controlled to further improve mobility and sustainability. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories and traffic signals in a unified framework at isolated signalized intersections in a CAV environment. A new planning horizon strategy is applied to conduct the optimization. All vehicle movements such as left-turning, right turning and through are considered. Phase sequences, green start and duration of each phase, and cycle lengths are optimized together with vehicle lane-changing behaviors and vehicle arrival times for delay minimization. Vehicles are split into platoons and are guaranteed to pass through the intersection at desired speeds and avoid stops at stop bars. Exact vehicle trajectories are determined based on optimized vehicle arrival times. For the trajectory planning of platoon leading vehicles, an optimal control model is implemented to minimize fuel consumption/emission. For following vehicles in a platoon, Newell's car following model is applied. Simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed control method over vehicle-actuated control in terms of intersection capacity, vehicle delays, and CO2 emissions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the potential benefits of a short minimum green duration as well as the impacts of no-changing zones on the optimality of the proposed model.

The input to this problem is a railway network and a set of demands for transportation. Each demand is a request for shipping a number of rail cars from one station to another. The one-block TFP now addresses two subproblems in the tactical level: Which pairs of stations are directly connected via a block (or: train service); and which demands are transported by each block. The aim is to service all demands against minimal costs. Moving beyond current researches on service network design, the unitary rule and the intree rule are taken into account in this study based on the Chinese railway background. We develop a linear binary programming formulation to minimize the total sum of train accumulation costs and car classification costs, subject to limitations on the classification capacity and the number of sort tracks at each station. Furthermore, we propose a novel solution methodology that applies a tree-based decomposition algorithm. Here, we first decompose the whole network into a series of rooted trees for each destination separately. Then, we divide the trees further into sufficiently small subtrees, whose size is regulated by a node size parameter. Finally, we construct a restricted linear binary model for each subtree and solve these models sequentially to find their optimal solutions. The algorithm ensures that an overall feasible solution is obtained if one exists. Our computational results on a realistic network from the Chinese railway system with 83 stations, 158 links and 5700 randomly generated demands show that the proposed algorithm can derive high-quality solutions within a few hours of computation time. These solutions are on average 48.05% better than those obtained after solving the linear binary program with a commercial solver for 1 day. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A structural equation model was built to verify the reliability of the evaluation system. This study utilized the Delphi method to obtain the structure and process index data, and used the WHO/HAI standard method for the effect index data to evaluate the NEMP. Six regions were selected for empirical analysis so that suggestions for optimization could be put forward. Results: The structural equation model consisted of three parts: organization structure, executive process, and effect. The factor loading of the three indicators exceeded 0.5, indicating that this model complied with the preliminary fit criteria. In the organizational structure, rules and regulations and resource investment accounted for a large proportion, indicating that they had a great impact on the effect. As for the executive process, the weight of the seven indicators were similar, and they accounted for a large proportion, indicating that each indicator had a non-negligible impact on the effect. The p of all the three hypothesizes was less than .01, especially the p of hypothesis 3 was less than .001, indicating that the structure and process of NEMP affected the accessibility of the essential medicines, and three components of the model were positively correlated. Limitations: Some errors may exist in achieving appropriate expert selection because of potential researcher bias in the Delphi approach. The results from only six provinces in China may not be generalized nationwide. Conclusion: The structural indicators and process indicators have a significant impact on outcome indicators, and they also have correlations.

In Part 1 of the paper (Luan et al., 2018), three integrated optimization problems, namely the P-NLP problem (NLP: nonlinear programming), the P-PWA problem (PWA: piecewise affine), and the P-TSPO problem (TSPO: train speed profile option), have been developed for real-time traffic management that inherently include train control. A two-level approach and a custom-designed two-step approach have been proposed to solve these optimization problems. In Part 2 of the paper, aiming at energy-efficient train operation, we extend the three proposed optimization problems by introducing energy-related formulations. We first evaluate the energy consumption of a train motion. A set of nonlinear constraints is first proposed to calculate the energy consumption, which is further reformulated as a set of linear constraints for the P-TSPO problem and approximated by using a piecewise constant function for the PNLP and PPWA problems. Moreover, we consider the option of regenerative braking and present linear formulations to calculate the utilization of the regenerative energy obtained through braking trains. We focus on two objectives, i.e., delay recovery and energy efficiency, through using a weighted-sum formulation and an epsilon-constraint formulation. With these energy-related extensions, the nature of the three optimization problems remains same to Part 1. In numerical experiments conducted based on the Dutch test case, we consider the P-NLP approach and the P-TSPO aspects; the P-PWA approach is neglected due to its bad performance, as evaluated in Part 1. According to the experimental results, the P-TSPO approach still yields a better performance within the required computation time. The trade-off between train delay and energy consumption is investigated. The results show the possibility of reducing train delay and saving energy at the same time through managing train speed, by up to 4.0% and 5.6% respectively. In our case study, applying regenerative braking leads to a 22.9% reduction of the total energy consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The two networks intersect and interweave with each other throughout the city to furnish various route options for serving transit patrons with distinct ODs. The optimal design problem of this bimodal transit system, however, has not been well explored in the literature, partly due to the difficulty of modeling the patrons' complex route choice behavior in the bimodal networks. In light of this, we formulate parsimonious continuum models for minimizing the total cost of the patrons and the transit agency for an intersecting bimodal transit network in a grid city, where the perpendicular local and express lines intersect at transfer stops. Seven distinct route types are identified in this network, which represent realistic intra- and inter-modal route options. A lower-level assignment problem between these routes is embedded in the upper-level network design optimization problem. We develop an efficient method to find near-optimal designs of the intersecting network. Numerical results unveil a number of insightful findings, e.g., that sizable cost savings are observed for the intersecting bimodal design as compared to the single-mode designs for moderate to high demand levels, and that only moderate benefits are observed as compared to the trunk-feeder designs under certain operating conditions. We also show that the conventional practice of designing the local and express networks separately would greatly undermine the benefit of the bimodal system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce dynamic congestion effect into commuters' departure-time and mode choice behaviours, and analyse the endogenous interactions between their travel and residential relocation choices. Studies ignoring dynamic departure-time behaviour show an ambiguous effect of transit improvements to the city. However, we find that transit improvement has a definitive impact on city structure: it increases the residents' equilibrium utility, at a cost of increased suburb land use. We show that it is possible to design Pareto-improving land-use and transit policies which benefit the residents without causing urban sprawl. We provide analytically the existence conditions of such policies and suggest that a high return of land use tax to subsidize transit improvement is required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the large number of cruise passengers and regulations on sea environment protection, determining at which ports to dispose of the waste generated onboard a cruise ship is a key decision to reduce the cost for a cruise company. We address four versions of the problem: the cruise itinerary is either static or dynamic and the amount of waste generated on each voyage leg is either deterministic or stochastic. We propose a polynomial-time solution algorithm for the static deterministic model, and the idea of the algorithm can also be used to solve the static stochastic model and the dynamic deterministic model. Second, we identify the structure of the optimal policy to the dynamic stochastic problem, based on which an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed. Extensive numerical experiments derived from problems of real-case scales demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The source of uncertainty is heterogeneity in driving behavior, captured using driver specific speed-spacing relations, i.e., parametric uncertainty. It also results in smooth vehicle trajectories in a stochastic context, which is in agreement with real-world traffic dynamics and, thereby, overcoming issues with aggressive oscillation typically observed in sample paths of stochastic traffic flow models. We utilize ensemble filtering techniques for data assimilation (traffic state estimation), but derive the mean and covariance dynamics as the ensemble sizes go to infinity, thereby bypassing the need to sample from the parameter distributions while estimating the traffic states. As a result, the estimation algorithm is just a standard Kalman-Bucy algorithm, which renders the proposed approach amenable to real-time applications using recursive data. Data assimilation examples are performed and our results indicate good agreement with out-of-sample data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we develop two network-based measures for systematically characterizing the redundancy of transportation networks: travel alternative diversity and network spare capacity. Specifically, the travel alternative diversity dimension is to evaluate the existence of multiple modes and effective routes available for travelers or the number of effective connections between a specific origin-destination pair. The network spare capacity dimension is to quantify the network-wide residual capacity with an explicit consideration of travelers' mode and route choice behaviors as well as congestion effect. They can address two fundamental questions in the pre-disaster transportation system evaluation and planning, i.e., how many effective redundant alternatives are there for travelers in the normal or disruptive event? and how much redundant capacity does the network have? To implement the two measures in practice, computational methods are provided to evaluate the network redundancy. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the features of the two redundancy measures as well as the applicability of the computational methods. The analysis results reveal that the two measures have different characterizations on network redundancy from different perspectives, and they can complement each other by providing meaningful information to both travelers and planners.

The problem is to re-schedule flights and re-assign aircraft in real time with minimized recovery cost for airlines after disruptions occur. In most published studies, airport capacity and flexible maintenance are not considered simultaneously via an optimization approach. To bridge this gap, we propose a column generation heuristic to solve the problem. The framework consists of a master problem for selecting routes for aircraft and subproblems for generating routes. Airport capacity is explicitly considered in the master problem and swappable planned maintenances can be incorporated in the subproblem. Instead of discrete delay models which are widely adopted in much of the existing literature, in this work flight delays are continuous and optimized accurately in the subproblems. The continuous-delay model can improve the accuracy of the optimized recovery cost by up to 37.74%. The computational study based on real-world problems shows that the master problem gives very tight linear relaxation with small, often zero, optimality gaps. Large-scale problems can be solved within 6 min and the run time can be further shortened by parallelizing subproblems on more powerful hardware. In addition, from a managerial point of view, computational experiments reveal that swapping planned maintenances may bring a considerable reduction in recovery cost by about 20% and 60%, depending on specific problem instances. Furthermore, the decreasing marginal value of airport slot quota is found by computational experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective was to evaluate the economic value of HUK vs NBP for patients with AIS from a Chinese payees perspective. Methods: An economic evaluation based on data of patients who have been treated with either HUK (n = 488) or NBP (n = 885) from a prospective, phase IV, multi-center, clinical registry study (Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Outcome Registry, CASTOR) was conducted to analyze the cost and effectiveness of HUK vs NBP for AIS in China. Before the analysis, the patients were matched using propensity score. Both a cost-minimization analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis were conducted to compare the matched pairs. A bootstrapping exercise was conducted for the matched arms to demonstrate the probability of one intervention being cost-effective over another for a given willingness-topay for an extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: After propensity score matching, 463 pairs were matched. The overall medical cost in the HUK arm is USD 2,701.20, while the NBP arm is USD 3,436.83, indicating HUK is preferred with cost-minimization analysis. Although the QALY gained in the HUK arm (0.77176) compared with the NBP arm (0.76831) is statistically insignificant (p==.4862), the cost-effectiveness analysis as exploratory analysis found that, compared with NBP, HUK is a cost-saving strategy with the lower costs of USD 735.63 and greater QALYs gained of 0.00345. Among the 5,000 bootstrapping replications, 100% indicates that HUK is cost-effective compared with NBP under a 1-time-GDP threshold; and 97.12% indicates the same under a 3-time-GDP threshold. Conclusion: This economic evaluation study indicates that administrating HUK is a cost-saving therapy compared with NBP for managing blood flow during AIS in the Chinese setting.","[Lin, Ziyi] Shanghai Centennial Sci Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Rao, Xiuqin; Zhang, Zhijun] Techpool Biopharma Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jianwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Hlth Econ Res Inst, 132 Waihuan Dong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Xuan, JW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Hlth Econ Res Inst, 132 Waihuan Dong Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xuanjw3@sysu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Ziyi/0000-0002-3656-3601","Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.","Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.","This study was funded by Techpool Bio-pharma Co., Ltd.",,25,2,4,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We then investigate the impact of surge pricing using a bi-level programming framework, with the lower-level problem capturing the equilibrium work hour choices while the upper-level one representing revenue-maximizing surge pricing.

The evolution of the human drivers' route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.

The lower level problem is ridesharing user equilibrium (RUE). To reduce the problem size and facilitate computation, we reformulate RUE in the link-node representation. Then we extend the RUE framework to accommodate the presence of HOT lanes and tolls.

In a generic liner shipping network with butterfly ports, each ship route is separated into a set of subloops on the basis of its structure and internal butterfly ports. Reversing the subloop directions has an impact on the network-wide cost including inventory cost, transshipment cost, and slot-purchasing cost. This paper proposes a new destination-based nonlinear model for the subloop-based reversal of port rotation directions with the objective of minimizing the overall network-wide cost. We prove that the addressed problem is NP hard. Next, the model is transformed to an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model. Based on the structure of the reformulated model, we develop a Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm and a metaheuristic method to solve practical-size instances. Three acceleration strategies are incorporated into the BD algorithm, which are adding Pareto-optimal cuts, updating big-M coefficients and generating combinatorial Benders cuts. Case studies based on three small examples and an Asia-Europe-Oceania liner shipping network with a total of 46 ports are conducted. Results show that the problem could be efficiently solved by the accelerated BD algorithm and the optimization of subloop directions is conducive to decreasing the network-wide cost especially the inventory cost.

Based on the MFD framework, extensive research has been dedicated to devising perimeter control strategies to protect the network from gridlock. Recent research has revealed that the stochasticity and time-varying nature of travel demand can introduce significant scattering in the MFD, thus reducing the definition of the MFD dynamics. However, this type of demand effect on the behavior of the MFD dynamics has not been well studied. In this article, we investigate such effect and propose some appropriate boundary conditions to ensure that the MFD dynamics are well-defined. These boundary conditions can be regarded as travel demand adjustment in traffic rationing. For perimeter control design, a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the controllability, an important but yet untouched issue, are derived for general multi-region MFD systems. The stability of the network equilibrium and convergence of the network dynamics are then analyzed in the sense of Lyapunov. Both theoretical and numerical results indicate that the network traffic converges to the desired uncongested equilibrium under proper boundary conditions in conjunction with proper control measures. The results are consistent with some existing studies and offer a control systems perspective regarding the demand-oriented behavior analysis of MFD-based network traffic dynamics. A surprising finding is that if the control purpose is to regulate the traffic to a desired level of service, the perimeter control gain can be simply chosen as its desired steady state, that is, the control gain is a constant and can be implemented as proportional control. This property sheds light on the road pricing design based on the MFD framework by minimizing the gap between the actual traffic state and the desired traffic state. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The considered problem is an integration of three interconnected sub-problems from different planning levels: the strategic fleet sizing and mix problem, the tactical voyage planning problem, and the operational stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem. To obtain the optimal solution of the problem, this paper provides a two-step algorithmic scheme. In the first step, the stochastic backhaul cargo canvassing problem is solved by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, leading to optimal canvassing strategies for all feasible voyages of all ships. In the second step, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that jointly solves the fleet sizing and mix problem and the voyage planning problem is formulated using the results from the first step. To efficiently solve the proposed MIP model, this paper develops a tailored Benders decomposition method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed models and solution methods for practical instances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Three innovative integrated optimization approaches for real-time traffic management that inherently include train control are developed to deliver both a train dispatching solution (including train routes, orders, departure and arrival times at passing stations) and a train control solution (i.e., train speed trajectories). Train speed is considered variable, and the blocking time of a train on a block section dynamically depends on its real speed. To formulate the integrated problem, we first propose an MINLP problem (PNLP), which is solved by a two-level approach. This MINLP problem is then reformulated by approximating the nonlinear terms with piecewise affine functions, resulting in an MILP problem (PewA). Moreover, we consider a preprocessing method to generate the possible speed profile options for each train on each block section, one of which is further selected by a proposed MILP problem (PTspo) with respect to safety, capacity, and speed consistency constraints. This problem is solved by means of a custom-designed two-step approach, in order to speed up the solving procedure. Numerical experiments are conducted using data from the Dutch railway network to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the three proposed approaches with heterogeneous traffic. According to the experimental results, the MILP approach (PTspo) yields the best overall performance within the required computation time. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the integration, i.e., train delays can be reduced by managing train speed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The total demand dissatisfaction of a bike-sharing system in this study is defined as the sum of the difference between the bike deficiency and unloading quantity of each station in the system. Two service times are considered: the total service time and the maximum route duration of the fleet. To reduce the computation time to solve the loading and unloading sub-problem of the BRP, this study examines a novel set of loading and unloading strategies and further proves them to be optimal for a given route. This set of strategies is then embedded into an enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the BRP. The numerical results demonstrate that a larger fleet size may not lead to a lower total service time but can effectively lead to a lower maximum route duration at optimality. The results also illustrate the trade-offs between the two service times, between total demand dissatisfaction and total service time, and between the number of operating vehicles provided and the TDD. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the optimal values of the two service times can increase with the TDD and introducing an upper bound on one service time can reduce the optimal value of the other service time.

Nanjing-one of the first provincial capital cities to implement the reformis studied to evaluate the effects of the comprehensive reform on drug prices in public hospitals, and to explore differential compensation plans.Methods: Sixteen hospitals were selected, and financial data were collected over the 48-month period before the reform and for 12 months after the reform. An analysis was carried out using a simple linear interrupted time series model.Results: The average difference ratio of drug surplus fell 13.39% after the reform, and the drug markups were basically eliminated. Revenue from medical services showed a net growth of 28.25%. The overall compensation received from government financial budget and medical service revenue growth was 103.69% for the loss from policy-permitted 15% markup sales, and 116.48% for the net loss. However, there were large differences in compensation levels at different hospitals, ranging from -21.92% to 413.74% by medical services revenue growth, causing the combined rate of both financial and service compensation to vary from 28.87-413.74%, There was a significant positive correlation between the services compensation rate and the proportion of medical service revenue (p<.001), and the compensation rate increased by 8% for every 1% increase in the proportion of services revenue.Discussion: Nanjing's pricing and compensation reform has basically achieved the policy targets of eliminating the drug markups, promoting the growth of medical services revenue, and adjusting the structure of medical revenue. However, the growth rate of service revenue of hospitals varied significantly from one another.Conclusions: Nanjing's reform represents successful pricing and compensation reform in Chinese urban public hospitals. It is recommended that a differentiated and dynamic compensation plan should be established in accordance with the revenue structure of different hospitals.","[Tang, Wenxi; Xie, Jing; Lu, Yijuan; Ma, Aixia] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qizhi] Nanjing Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Publ Hosp Management Comm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Malone, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",China Pharmaceutical University; University of Arizona,"Ma, AX (通讯作者)，China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ma86128@sina.com,,,Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program [71603278]; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation [2016SJD630007],Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation,This project is funded by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program (Grant NO: 71603278) and Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (Grant NO: 2016SJD630007).,,48,16,16,0,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We show that when the buyer's budget is publicly known, the better of selling each item separately and selling the grand bundle extracts a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. When the budget is private, we consider a standard Bayesian setting where buyer's budget b is drawn from a known distribution B. We show that if b is independent of the valuations and distribution B satisfies monotone hazard rate condition, then selling items separately or in a grand bundle is still approximately optimal. We give a complementary example showing that no constant approximation simple mechanism is possible if budget b can be interdependent with valuations.","[Cheng, Yu; Munagala, Kamesh; Wang, Kangning] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Gravin, Nick] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Duke University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, KN (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",yucheng@cs.duke.edu; kamesh@cs.duke.edu; knwang@cs.duke.edu; nikolai@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-0019-2570; Wang, Kangning/0000-0001-8688-2478","NSF [CCF-1408784, CCF-1527084, CCF1535972, CCF-1637397, CCF-1704656, IIS-1447554]; NSF CAREER Award [CCF1750140]; Adobe Data Science Research Award",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Adobe Data Science Research Award,"Yu Cheng is supported by NSF grants CCF-1527084, CCF1535972, CCF-1637397, CCF-1704656, IIS-1447554, and NSF CAREER Award CCF1750140.
