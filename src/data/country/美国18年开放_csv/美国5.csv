Under its constant proportionality assumption, the value of a quality-adjusted life span is defined as the product of preference weight and life span. Objectives: To empirically identify an alternative functional relationship between life span and value by relaxing the constant proportionality assumption. Methods: Using an online survey, 5367 respondents completed 30 to 40 paired comparisons where each involved a choice between two health outcomes: one with a longer life span and health problems (five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire) and the other with a shorter life span and no problems (time trade-off pair). Using 2670 pairs, a saturated model with indicator variables for 27 life spans and 90 health problems of varying duration and severity was estimated by maximum likelihood. Its coefficients empirically illustrate the relationship between life span and value on a quality-adjusted life-year scale. Results: The results reject constant proportionality (P < 0.01) and support the use of a power function to describe the relationship between life span and value, namely, value = preference weight x life span(beta) The estimate of power (beta = 0.415; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.42) appears to depend on whether life span was expressed in a temporal unit of days (0.403), weeks (0.509), months (0.541), or years (0.654). Conclusions: Raising life span to a power less than 1 implies decreasing marginal value of life span and greatly improved model fit, and confirms previous violations of proportionality. This power function may replace conventional assumptions in health valuation studies. Nevertheless, governmental agencies may favor a longer time horizon than that of the general population.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 East Fowler Ave,CMC206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Rand, Kim] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Rand, Kim] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway; [Bailey, Henry] Univ West Indies, Arthur Lok Jack Global Sch Business, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Bailey, Henry] Univ West Indies, Ctr Hlth Econ, HEU, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Stalmeier, Peep F.

Yet relatively little is known about the impact that new treatments have on labor productivity. Objectives: To examine the relationship between new drug treatments and gains in labor productivity across conditions in the United States and to evaluate which randomized clinical trials (RCTs) collected labor productivity data. Methods: We collected data on US-based RCTs with work-ability surveys from searches of Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Registry of Clinical Trials, and ClinicalTrails.gov. Combining RCT data with survey data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we assessed productivity changes from new drug treatments. Results: During the last decade, some disease conditions have seen treatments that improve ability to work by as much as 60%. The annual increase in productivity gains attributable to new drug treatments was modest 1.1% (P = 0.53). Of the 5092 RCTs reviewed, abilityto-work measures were collected in 2% of trials. Work productivity surveys were more likely among prevalent medical conditions that affected individuals who worked, earned higher wages, and experienced larger reductions in hours worked as a consequence of disease diagnosis. Conclusions: From our data, we estimated that drug innovation increased productivity by 4.8 million work days per year and $221 billion in wages per year. These labor-sector benefits should be taken into account when assessing the socially optimal cost for new drug innovation.","[Chen, Alice J.] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downy Way,VPD 414J, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Chen, Alice J.] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 635 Downy Way,VPD 414J, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Goldman, Dana P.] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Goldman, Dana P.] Univ Southern Calif, Sch Pharm, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Chen, AJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downy Way,VPD 414J, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;Chen, AJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 635 Downy Way,VPD 414J, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",alicejc@price.usc.edu,"Goldman, Dana P/E-7667-2013; Chen, Alice/AAD-1367-2022","Goldman, Dana P/0000-0001-8498-6396; Chen, Alice/0000-0002-7908-2664","Leonard D.

We contribute efficient propensity score regression estimators to a class of treatment effects for the treated, under the cases when the propensity scores are unknown and when they are known. Our efficient estimator matches on a normalized propensity score that combines the true propensity score and the nonparametric estimate.

I use invariance arguments to construct a new minimum distance objective function. With respect to a particular weight matrix, the minimum distance estimator is equivalent to the random effects estimator of Chamberlain and Imbens (2004), and the estimator of the coefficient on the endogenous regressor coincides with the limited information maximum likelihood estimator. This weight matrix is inefficient unless the errors are normal, and I construct a new, more efficient estimator based on the optimal weight matrix. Finally, I show that when the minimum distance objective function does not impose a proportionality restriction on the reduced-form coefficients, the resulting estimator corresponds to a version of the bias-corrected two-stage least squares estimator. I use the objective function to construct confidence intervals that remain valid when the proportionality restriction is violated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The reason is such father-child resemblance induces a father to spend more time engaged in positive parenting. An extra day (per month) of time investment by a typical visiting father enhances child health by just over 10% of a standard deviation. This estimate is not biased by the effect of child health on father-involvement or omitted maternal ability, thereby eliminating endogeneity biases that plague existing studies. The result has implications regarding the role of a father's time in enhancing child health, especially in fragile families. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The conventional asymptotic theory completely ignores the estimation uncertainty in the weighting matrix, and as a result it may not reflect finite-sample situations well. In this paper, we employ the more accurate fixed-smoothing asymptotic framework to compare the performances of the one-step and two-step procedures. We show that the two-step procedures outperform the one-step procedures only when the squared long-run canonical correlation coefficients between two blocks of transformed moment conditions are larger than the thresholds established in this paper. The thresholds depend on the criteria of interest. A Monte Carlo study lends support to our asymptotic results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We relax restrictive assumptions by computing optimal directions subject to profit maximization and cost minimization, correct for the potential endogeneity of inputs and outputs, estimate latent prices for bad outputs, measure firms' responses to shadow prices rather than actual prices, and introduce an unobserved productivity term into the DDF. For an unbalanced panel of U.S. electric utilities, a model assuming profit-maximization outperforms one assuming cost-minimization, while lagged productivity and energy price have the greatest effect on productivity.

In this study, its investigators noticed that some interviewers did not fully explain the C-TTO task to respondents. Evidence from a follow-up study in 2014 confirmed that when interviewers followed the protocol, the distribution of C-TTO responses widened. Objectives: To handle the data quality issues in the C-TTO responses by estimating a hybrid interval regression model to produce a Spanish EQ-5D-5L value set. Methods: Four different models were tested. Model 0 integrated C-TTO and DCE responses in a hybrid model and models 1 to 3 altered the interpretation of the C-TTO responses: model 1 allowed for censoring of the C-TTO responses, whereas model 2 incorporated interval responses and model 3 included the interviewer-specific protocol violations. For external validation, the predictions of the four models were compared with those of the follow-up study using the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Results: This stepwise approach to modeling C-TTO and DCE responses improved the concordance between the valuation and follow-up studies (concordance correlation coefficient: 0.948 [model 0], 0.958 [model 1], 0.952 [model 2], and 0.989 [model 3]). We recommend the estimates from model 3, because its hybrid interval regression model addresses the data quality issues found in the valuation study. Conclusions: Protocol violations may occur in any valuation study; handling them in the analysis can improve external validity. The resulting EQ-5D-5L value set (model 3) can be applied to inform Spanish health technology assessments.","[Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Ramallo-Farina, Yolanda] Canary Isl Hlth Serv, HTA Unit, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Univ Navarra, Navarra, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Ramallo-Farina, Yolanda; Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Res Network Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Navarra; Glasgow Caledonian University; National University of Singapore; University of Oxford,"Ramos-Go√±i, JM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEuroQol Res Fdn, Execut Off, C Calvario 271-B 1IZQ, Tacoronte 38350, Canary Islands, Spain.",jramos@euroqol.org,"Ramallo-Fari√±a, Yolanda/AAE-9355-2021; prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008; prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022","Ramallo-Fari√±a, Yolanda/0000-0002-1541-3989; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544; Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316",Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion; Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [PI12/02103]; EuroQol Research Foundation,Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion; Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Union (EU)); EuroQol Research Foundation,"This study was financially supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion, Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion 2013-2016, and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (grant no.

We hypothesized that coverage for medications is more restricted than corresponding coverage for nonmedication interventions. Methods: We included top-selling medications and highly utilized procedures. For each intervention-indication pair, we classified value in terms of cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year), as reported by the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry. For each intervention-indication pair and for each of 10 large payers, we classified coverage, when available, as either more restrictive or as not more restrictive, compared with a benchmark. The benchmark reflected the US Food and Drug Administration label information, when available, or pertinent clinical guidelines. We compared coverage policies and the benchmark in terms of step edits and clinical restrictions. Finally, we regressed coverage restrictiveness against intervention type (medication or nonmedication), controlling for value (cost-effectiveness more or less favorable than a designated threshold). Results: We identified 392 medication and 185 procedure coverage decisions. A total of 26.3% of the medication coverage and 38.4% of the procedure coverage decisions were more restrictive than their corresponding benchmarks. After controlling for value, the odds of being more restrictive were 42% lower for medications than for procedures. Including unfavorable tier placement in the definition of more restrictive greatly increased the proportion of medication coverage decisions classified as more restrictive and reversed our findings. Conclusions: Therapy access depends on factors other than cost and clinical benefit, suggesting potential health care system inefficiency.","[Chambers, James; Pope, Elle; Bungay, Kathy; Cohen, Joshua; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Ciarametaro, Michael; Dubois, Robert] Natl Pharmaceut Council, Washington, DC USA",,"Cohen, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",jcohen@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,"Pope, Elle/0000-0002-1362-5056",National Pharmaceuticals Council,National Pharmaceuticals Council,Funding was provided by the National Pharmaceuticals Council.,,13,4,4,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21.0,4.0,,,,,400,406,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.007,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680096.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430442800007,0

The five recent value frameworks that motivated this report vary in the types of decisions they intend to inform, ranging from coverage, access, and pricing decisions to those defining appropriate clinical pathways and to supporting provider-clinician shared decision making. Each of these value frameworks must be evaluated in its own decision context for its own objectives. Existing guidelines for cost-effectiveness analysis emphasize the importance of clearly specifying the perspective from which the analysis is undertaken. Relevant perspectives may include, among others, 1) the health plan enrollee, 2) the patient, 3) the health plan manager, 4) the provider, 5) the technology manufacturer, 6) the specialty society, 7) government regulators, or 8) society as a whole.

In this section we introduce the work of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Special Task Force on US Value Assessment Frameworks formed to review relevant perspectives and appropriate approaches and methods to support the definition and use of high-quality value frameworks. The Special Task Force was part of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Initiative on US Value Assessment Frameworks, which enlisted the expertise of leading health economists, concentrating on what the field of health economics can provide to help inform the development and use of value assessment frameworks. We focus on five value framework initiatives: the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. These entities differ in their missions, scope of activities, and methodological approaches. Because they are gaining visibility and some traction in the United States, it is essential to scrutinize whether the frameworks use approaches that are transparent as well as conceptually and methodologically sound. Our objectives were to describe the conceptual bases for value and its use in decision making, critically examine existing value frameworks, discuss the importance of sound conceptual underpinning, identify key elements of value relevant to specific decision contexts, and recommend good practice in value definition and implementation as well as areas for further research.","[Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 7th Floor,35 Kneeland St, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Garrison, LouisP., Jr.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Tufts Medical Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Neumann, PJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 7th Floor,35 Kneeland St, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",pneumann@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,,,,,42,61,65,3,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,119,123,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.012,0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477388.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000002,0

OBJECTIVES: To build hypothetical OBA models in which both payer and manufacturer can benefit. METHODS: Models were developed for a hypothetical hypercholesterolemia OBA, in which the OBA was assumed to increase market access for a newly marketed medication. Fixed inputs were drug and outcome event costs from the literature over a 1-year OBA period. Model estimates were developed using a range of inputs for medication effectiveness, medical cost offsets, and the treated population size. Positive or negative feedback to the manufacturer was incorporated on the basis of expectations of drug performance through changes in the reimbursement level. Model simulations demonstrated that parameters had the greatest impact on payer cost and manufacturer reimbursement. RESULTS: Models suggested that changes in the size of the population treated and drug effectiveness had the largest influence on reimbursement and costs. Despite sharing risk for potential product underperformance, manufacturer reimbursement increased relative to having no OBA, if the OBA improved market access for the new product. Although reduction in medical costs did not fully offset the cost of the medication, the payer could still save on net costs per patient relative to having no OBA by tying reimbursement to drug effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care payers have demonstrated interest in OBAs, and under a certain set of assumptions both may benefit.

We investigate the effect of a simple scalable planning intervention on a repeated behavior using a randomized design involving 877 subjects at a private gym. Subjects were randomized into i) a treatment group who selected the days and times they intended to attend the gym over the next two weeks or ii) a control group who instead recorded their days of exercise in the prior two weeks. In contrast to recent studies, we find that the planning intervention did not have a positive effect on behavior. We observe a tightly estimated null effect even though the majority of subjects believed that planning is helpful and despite clear evidence that they engaged with the planning process.

Methods: This study was a substudy of a broader evaluation of measurement properties of PerfO measures. The PerfO measures assessed were timed up and go (TUG), four-step stair climb (4SC), long stair climb (LSC), and repeated chair stand (RCS). For this substudy, HF and eTHR participants were interviewed to evaluate the relevance and difficulty of each PerfO measure. Qualitative analysis was conducted on interview transcripts, and summaries of coded data were produced to assess saturation. Results: All 18 HF participants related the PerfO measures (TUG, 4SC, and RSC) to activities they completed in daily life, with slight variations in some specific aspects. For the eight eTHR participants, the correspondence between the PerfO measures (TUG, 4SC, and LSC) and activities in daily life varied: all participants saw similarity in the movements for the TUG; most undertook short stair climbs in daily life, but most did not regularly undertake LSC in daily life. Nevertheless, all HF and eTHR participants reported that the PerfO measures were relevant and had a level of difficulty similar to daily activities. Conclusions: This study contributes novel methods that adapt US regulatory guidance for patient-reported outcome measures to the evaluation of PerfO measures. A structured approach was used to explore specific details of each measure and correspondence to everyday life. This study demonstrates how content validity of PerfO measures can be meaningfully assessed.","[Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Kerr, Cicely; Mowbray, Fiona] ICON Clin Res, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Bush, Elizabeth Nicole] Eli Lilly & Co, Patient Focused Outcomes Ctr Expertise, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; Eli Lilly,"Ballinger, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåICON Clin Res UK Ltd, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",rachel.ballinger@iconplc.com,,"Kerr, Cicely/0000-0003-3921-0841; Mowbray, Fiona/0000-0002-3297-4163",Eli Lilly and Co.,Eli Lilly and Co.(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co.,,12,3,3,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1115,1123,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.005,0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224117.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444833500015,0

We provide a set of sufficient conditions for the consistency of any bootstrap procedure in this problem. We compare the finite sample performance of different bootstrap procedures through simulation studies. The results indicate that our proposed smoothed bootstrap outperforms other bootstrap schemes, including the m-out-of-n bootstrap. Additionally, we prove a convergence theorem for triangular arrays of random variables arising from binary choice models, which may be of independent interest. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When specifically designed instruments cannot be applied, mapping algorithms for non-preference-based instruments can be used for prediction of health utility scores. Objectives: To develop a mapping algorithm for the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-Hepatitis C Version (CLDQ-HCV), the hepatitis C virus-specific quality-of-life instrument. Methods: We used a sample of patients with HCV who completed the short form 36 health survey and the CLDQ-HCV in clinical trials; six-dimensional health state short form (SF-6D) utilities were derived from the 36-item short form health survey. Regression models with components of the CLDQ-HCV being predictors and SF-6D being the outcome were developed and tested in an independent testing set and in clinically significant subpopulations. Results: The sample of 34,822 records was split (4:1) into training and testing set. Simple mixed models had a root mean square error up to 0.088; predicted and observed utilities were highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.81-0.82) although predicted utilities were underestimated in the range closest to perfect scores. Generalized linear models had better average accuracy (root mean square error up to 0.0839; correlations up to 0.844) and significantly better accuracy in the highest values (median error up to 0.065). Accuracy in the independent testing set was nearly identical, and so was accuracy in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis; the errors of group means were less than 0.015. Conclusions: A number of linear models for mapping domains or items of CLDQ-HCV to SF-6D health utilities have been developed. The models have excellent accuracy at the group level. Predicted health utility scores can be used in further economic analyses involving patients with HCV.","[Stepanova, Maria; Younossi, Issah; Racila, Andrei; Younossi, Zobair M.] Ctr Outcomes Res Liver Dis, Washington, DC USA; [Younossi, Zobair M.] Inova Hlth Syst, Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Claude Moore Hlth Educ & Res Bldg,3300 Gallows Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA",Inova Health System,"Younossi, ZM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåInova Hlth Syst, Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Claude Moore Hlth Educ & Res Bldg,3300 Gallows Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",zobair.younossi@inova.org,"Stepanova, Maria/V-5513-2019; Younossi, Zobair M./JRY-9916-2023","Stepanova, Maria/0000-0003-0444-8155;",Gilead Sciences,Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences),This study was funded by Gilead Sciences.,,52,7,7,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,612,621,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.005,0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753360.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432175400018,0

Such applications include the forecasting of volatility, correlation, beta, quadratic variation, jump variation, and other functionals of an underlying continuous-time process. We provide primitive conditions under which a negligibility result holds, and thus the asymptotic size of standard predictive accuracy tests, implemented using a high-frequency proxy for the latent variable, is controlled. An extensive simulation study verifies that the asymptotic results apply in a range of empirically relevant applications, and an empirical application to correlation forecasting is presented.

In most COI studies, productivity costs are estimated primarily as the economic value of production forgone associated with loss of paid employment (foregone gross earnings); some studies include the imputed value of lost unpaid work as well. This approach is commonly but imprecisely referred to as the human capital approach (HCA). However, there is a lack of consensus among health economists as to how to quantify loss of economic productivity. Some experts argue that the HCA overstates productivity losses and propose use of the friction cost approach (FCA) that estimates societal productivity loss as the short-term costs incurred by employers in replacing a lost worker. This review sought to identify COI studies published during 1995-2017 that used the FCA, with or without comparison to the HCA, and to compare FCA and HCA estimates from those studies that used both approaches. We identified 80 full COI studies (of which 75% focused on chronic conditions), roughly 5-8% of all COI studies. The majority of those studies came from three countries, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands, that have officially endorsed use of the FCA. The FCA results in smaller productivity loss estimates than the HCA, although the differential varied widely across studies. Lack of standardization of HCA and FCA methods makes productivity cost estimates difficult to compare across studies.","[Pike, Jamison] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis, 1600 Clifton Rd NE,MS A-19, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Grosse, Scott D.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Birth Defects & Dev Disabil, Atlanta, GA USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Pike, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCtr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Immunizat & Resp Dis, 1600 Clifton Rd NE,MS A-19, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",kqv1@cdc.gov,,"Grosse, Scott/0000-0003-1078-6855; Pike, Jamison/0000-0002-3442-5627",Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural CDC HHS,,,109,97,101,1,23,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This paper studies in high dimensions the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) test, a popular specification test for endogeneity in IV regression. We show, surprisingly, that the DWH test maintains its size in high dimensions, but at an expense of power. We propose a new test that remedies this issue and has better power than the DWH test.

This work investigates two types of state laws that regulate the procedures under which pharmacists substitute bioequivalent generic versions of brand name drugs. Mandatory substitution laws require pharmacists to use the generic as a default, and presumed consent laws allow them to assume that the patient agrees to the substitution. Both situations can be overruled by the patient. Using plausibly exogenous changes in states' laws, we use difference-in-differences and a discrete choice model to show that although the mandatory switching laws have little effect, the presumed consent laws reduce consumers' probability of purchasing brand name drugs by 3.2% points. The differential effectiveness of the laws is likely caused by pharmacists' profit motives. These results offer important implications for policies that seek to reduce drug expenditures by incentivizing the use of generic drugs.","[Song, Yan] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Huangpu Ave 601, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Barthold, Douglas] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcome Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Jinan University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Song, Y (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Huangpu Ave 601, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",kprinceing@gmail.com,"Song, Yan/O-8528-2019","Song, Yan/0000-0002-8669-4116","McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team [HOA-80072l]; CIHR [MOP 93546]; Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award; WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging [P01AG033559]; National Institutes of Health [R01HL126804, R01HL130642]",McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"McGill University; CIHR Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhanced Team, Grant/Award Number: HOA-80072l; CIHR Operating, Grant/Award Number: MOP 93546; Healthier Societies Initiative at the Institute for Health and Social Policy (IHSP); Heller Family Fellowship; M&P Vineberg Fellowship in Economics; McCall MacBain Fellowship; McGill University Principal's Graduate Fellowship; McGill University Provost's Graduate Fellowship; Russell Davidson SSHRC Award; WYNG Trust Fellowship; National Institute on Aging, Grant/Award Number: P01AG033559; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Numbers: R01HL126804 and R01HL130642",,36,24,30,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1717,1737,,10.1002/hec.3796,0,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29992674.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446323300006,0

Objectives: To estimate the social benefits of public cord blood bank inventory net of cord blood banks' operational costs. Methods: We used publicly available data from the Health Resources and Service Administration on the number of annual cord blood transplants as well as the patient age distribution in 2010, and the survival estimates between 2008 and 2012 for the several diseases treated by cord blood transplantation. Data on aggregate annual costs to the cord blood industry for recruitment, processing, and storage were obtained from published work. We used estimated increases in life expectancy due to treatment using umbilical cord blood and value for life-years gained to estimate the social benefits of the public cord blood inventory annually. Results: We found that the annual social benefits of between $500 million and $1.5 billion outweigh the current operational annual costs of running cord blood banks of $60 to $70 million by a significant margin. Conclusions: We estimated that the annual social benefit of having a cord blood system far outweighs its costs, by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, the social benefits of maintaining the US public cord blood banking system at the present time far outweigh the costs of collecting, storing, and distributing cord blood. This suggests that there is a potential justification for government intervention to align social benefits and costs. Nevertheless, simple fixes may produce unintended consequences, and so a careful design for subsidies is needed.","[Strong, Aaron; Gracner, Tadeja; Chen, Peggy; Kapinos, Kandice] RAND Corp, 1200 South Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",RAND Corporation,"Strong, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåRAND Corp, 1200 South Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",astrong@rand.org,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Kapinos, Kandice/0000-0003-1577-4917","Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, Department of Health and Human Services [HHSP233201500038I]","Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, Department of Health and Human Services","Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a contract with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (contract no.

On a standard Holt-Laury criterion, parents of daughters, whether unborn or recently born, become almost twice as risk-averse as parents of sons. The study demonstrates this in longitudinal and cross-sectional data, for fathers and mothers, for babies in the womb and new-born children, and in a West European nation and East European nation. These findings may eventually aid our understanding of risky health behaviors and gender inequalities. (C) 2018 The Authors.

A closer look at vaccine prices reveals that not all vaccines shared the same increasing pattern. Various factors, such as vaccine attributes, competition, and supply shortages, could relate to price changes. In this study, we examined whether a variety of factors influenced the prices of noninfluenza childhood vaccines purchased in the public sector from 1996 to 2014. The association differed among price-capped vaccines and combination vaccines. There was an increasing time trend in real prices for non-price-capped vaccines, which was mostly offset by the effect of market longevity. The effect of competition in lowering prices was more pronounced among non-price-capped vaccines when manufacturer and vaccine component fixed effects were excluded. Supply shortage, manufacturer name change, and number of vaccine doses in series showed no effect. The results may help policy makers better understand price behaviors and make more informed decisions in vaccine planning and financing.","[Chen, Weiwei] Florida Int Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 11200 SW 8th St,AHC5 448, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Messonnier, Mark; Zhou, Fangjun] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Chen, WW (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåFlorida Int Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 11200 SW 8th St,AHC5 448, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",wechen@fiu.edu,"Chen, Weiwei/H-3363-2017","Chen, Weiwei/0000-0002-2162-0941",Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural CDC HHS,,,35,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,252,265,,10.1002/hec.3539,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28660666.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428523400014,0

Above this, Medicare pays 80%, prescription drug plans (PDPs) pay 15%, and beneficiaries pay a 5% copay. However, recent growth in catastrophic spending is caused by expensive specialty drugs. The 5% copay, on top of out-of-pocket spending, could result in beneficiaries not accessing specialty drugs. To assist beneficiaries, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) proposes to eliminate beneficiary catastrophic cost sharing, while PDPs pay 80% and Medicare pays 20%. Our objective was to assess other government cost-sharing approaches and consider how they would affect pharmaceutical access, PDP Part D incentives, and pharmaceutical innovation. We reviewed published literature and government reports on cost sharing between US government divisions or between government and private commercial entities. We discussed their cost-sharing applicability to Part D. We found that the US government has utilized numerous cost-sharing approaches to enhance public-private partnerships. We reviewed four cost-sharing arrangements and their applicability to Medicare: the Byrd-Bond Amendment to the Clean Air ActMedicare bulk purchases drugs costing $8000+; North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)cost sharing based on high-risk markets; the Ryan White Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Actgrants to PDPs in high-risk markets and grants to beneficiaries who cannot afford drugs; and the Department of Veterans Affairsdrug price negotiation for expensive drugs. In conclusion, a variety of federal cost-sharing approaches provide precedent for altering PDP cost sharing. The government tends to prefer options that have been tried elsewhere.","[Padula, William V.; Ballreich, Jeromie; Anderson, Gerard F.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 N Broadway Ave, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Padula, WV (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJohns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 N Broadway Ave, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",wpadula@jhu.edu,"Padula, Bill/AGB-4625-2022","Ballreich, Jeromie/0000-0003-2564-4577",Commonwealth Fund; Arnold Foundation,Commonwealth Fund; Arnold Foundation,This investigation was supported by an unrestricted Grant from the Commonwealth Fund and the Arnold Foundation to Johns Hopkins University.,,28,2,3,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Using detailed location data on maternal addresses and GIS coordinates of gas wells, this study examines singleton births to mothers residing close to a shale gas well from 2003 to 2010 in Pennsylvania. The introduction of drilling increased low birth weight and decreased term birth weight on average among mothers living within 2.5 km of a well compared to mothers living within 2.5 km of a permitted well. Adverse effects were also detected using measures such as small for gestational age and APGAR scores, while no effects on gestation periods were found. In the intensive margin, an additional well is associated with a 7 percent increase in low birth weight, a 5 g reduction in term birth weight and a 3 percent increase in premature birth. These results are robust to other measures of infant health, many changes in specification and falsification tests. These findings suggest that shale gas development poses significant risks to human health. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The method, which can accommodate lagged dependent variables, serially correlated errors, unobserved variables, and many alternatives, builds on the ideas of indirect inference. The main difficulty in implementing indirect inference in discrete choice models is that the objective surface is a step function, rendering gradient based optimization methods useless. To overcome this obstacle, this paper shows how to smooth the objective surface. The key idea is to use a smoothed function of the latent utilities as the dependent variable in the auxiliary model. As the smoothing parameter goes to zero, this function delivers the discrete choice implied by the latent utilities, thereby guaranteeing consistency. We establish conditions on the smoothing such that our estimator enjoys the same limiting distribution as the indirect inference estimator, while at the same time ensuring that the smoothing facilitates the convergence of gradient based optimization methods. A set of Monte Carlo experiments shows that the method is fast, robust, and nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood when the auxiliary model is sufficiently rich.

We capture the role of perception through perception priorities; priorities that determine whether an object or alternative is perceived sooner or later than other alternatives. We identify agents' perception priorities from their violations of Luce's axiom of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA). The direction of the violation of IIA implies an orientation of agents' priority rankings. We adjust choice probabilities to account for the effects of perception, and impose that adjusted choice probabilities satisfy IIA. So all violations of IIA are accounted for by the perception order. The theory can explain some very well-documented behavioral phenomena in individual choice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Contributing factors to rising costs include expensive novel and emerging therapies, under-treatment of disease, under-management of comorbidities, and patient dissatisfaction with care results. Critical to identifying replicable improvement methods is a reliable model to measure value. Study Design: If we understand value within healthcare consumerism to be equal to a patient's health outcome improvement over costs associated with care (Value Outcomes/Costs), we can use this equation to measure the improvement of value. Methods: Research and literature show that patient activation the skills and confidence that equip patients to become actively engaged in their health care impact health outcomes, costs, and patient experience. Reaching patient activation through engagement methods including shared decision-making (SDM) lead to improved value of care received. The National Eczema Association (NEA) Shared Decision-Making Resource Center can be a transformative strategy to measure and evaluate value of health care interventions for eczema patients to advance a value-driven health care system in the United States. Results: Through this Resource Center, NEA will measure patient value through their own perceptions using validated PRO instruments and other patient-generated health data. Conclusions: Assessment of this data will reveal findings that can assist researchers in evaluating the impact this care framework on patient-perceived value across other chronic diseases.","[Block, Julie] Natl Eczema Assoc, 4460 Redwood Highway,Ste 16-D, San Rafael, CA 94903 USA",,"Block, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNatl Eczema Assoc, 4460 Redwood Highway,Ste 16-D, San Rafael, CA 94903 USA.",julie@nationaleczema.org,,,PhRMA Foundation Challenge Award,PhRMA Foundation Challenge Award,Funding was provided through the PhRMA Foundation Challenge Award.,,34,3,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21.0,4.0,,,,,380,385,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.014,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680092.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430442800003,0

Our new approach explicitly incorporates the effect of measurement errors and time varying attenuation biases into the covariance forecasts, by allowing the ex-ante predictions to respond more (less) aggressively to changes in the ex-post realized covariance measures when they are more (less) reliable. Applying the new procedures in the construction of minimum variance and minimum tracking error portfolios results in reduced turnover and statistically superior positions compared to existing procedures. Translating these statistical improvements into economic gains, we find that under empirically realistic assumptions a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay up to 170 basis points per year to shift to using the new class of forecasting models.

Objective: To examine the association between contract-level proportion of generic drugs dispensed (pGDD) and Medicare Part D star ratings. Methods: This was a retrospective study of linked 2011 Medicare Part D star rating data with contract-level pGDD data. A total of 477 individual Medicare prescription contracts were included, representing 75% of total Prescription Drug Plans and more than 65% of total Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans available by the end of 2010. Primary outcomes were Medicare Part D summary and domain star ratings (1-5 indicating lowest to highest performance), incorporating a range of quality measures for access, cost, beneficiary satisfaction, and health services outcomes and processes. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine associations between pGDD and Medicare Part D summary and domain star ratings, controlling for contract type and number of beneficiary enrollment. Results: Higher pGDD was associated with higher summary star ratings (adjusted odds ratio 1.08 with 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.12) and higher member experience with drug plan domain ratings (adjusted odds ratio 1.07 with 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.11). Conclusions: Prescription formulary benefit design targeting increasing generic drug use appears to be associated with improved member experience and higher plan star ratings. Consideration may be given to incorporating pGDD into Medicare Part D star rating measures to improve quality of prescription plans.

We study the best subset selection procedure by which the covariates are chosen by maximizing Manski (1975, 1985)'s maximum score objective function subject to a constraint on the maximal number of selected variables. We show that this procedure can be equivalently reformulated as solving a mixed integer optimization problem, which enables computation of the exact or an approximate solution with a definite approximation error bound. In terms of theoretical results, we obtain non-asymptotic upper and lower risk bounds when the dimension of potential covariates is possibly much larger than the sample size. Our upper and lower risk bounds are minimax rate-optimal when the maximal number of selected variables is fixed and does not increase with the sample size. We illustrate usefulness of the best subset binary prediction approach via Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of the work-trip transportation mode choice. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

A key focus of anal cancer prevention has been screening for and treating precancerous high-grade squamous intraepithelial anal lesions (HSILs). Objectives: To develop a health-related symptom index for HSIL using qualitative techniques because anal HSIL and its treatment may have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and no HRQOL measure specific to this condition and treatment currently exists. Methods: Expert consultation was used to guide one-on-one concept elicitation interviews with participants to identify HRQOL aspects they attribute to their anal HSIL and its treatment. This resulted in a draft instrument, which was administered to an independent participant sample, where cognitive interview techniques assessed comprehension. Results: Eighteen anal HSIL-related concepts were identified by the expert panel. Across the 41 concept elicitation interviews, 23 items representing physical symptoms, physical impacts, and psychological symptoms were identified to comprise the initial measure, which was then evaluated during three rounds of cognitive interviews (n = 45). Several questionnaire aspects were refined on the basis of participant input, with three additional items added per expert/participant recommendation. One item was removed because of poor comprehension, resulting in a 25-item measure. Conclusions: Using state-of-the-art qualitative methodology, we have established the content validity of this new instrument, the ANCHOR Anal HSIL Health-Related Symptom Index. Quantitative validation efforts are currently underway.

In the last decade, the number of children diagnosed with these conditions has inexplicably been on the rise. This increase has been concentrated in the Medicaid caseload nationwide. One of the most striking changes in Medicaid has been the transition from fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement to Medicaid managed care (MMC), which had taken place in 80% of states by 2016. Using Medicaid claims from South Carolina, we show that this change contributed to the increase in asthma and ADHD caseloads. Empirically, we rely on variation in MMC enrollment due to a change in the default Medicaid plan from FFS to MMC, and on rich panel data that allow us to follow the same children before and after they were required to switch. We find that the transition from FFS to MMC explains about a third of the rise in the number of Medicaid children being treated for ADHD and asthma, along with increases in treatment for many other conditions. These are likely to be due to the incentives created by the risk adjustment and quality control systems in MMC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our starting point is players' preferences on return distribution vectors, essentially mappings from states of the world to distributions of returns to be received by players. There are two ways in which equilibria for this preference game can be defined. Also, when the preferences possess ever more features, we can gradually add more structures to the game. These include real-valued functions over return-distribution vectors, sets of probabilistic priors over states of the world, and eventually the traditional expected-utility framework involving one single prior. We establish equilibrium existence results, show the upper hemi-continuity of equilibrium sets over changing ambiguity attitudes, and uncover relations between the two versions of equilibria. Some attention is paid to the enterprising game, in which players exhibit ambiguity-seeking attitudes while betting optimistically on the favorable resolution of ambiguities. The two solution concepts are unified at this game's pure equilibria, whose existence is guaranteed when strategic complementarities are present. The current framework can be applied to settings like auctions involving ambiguity on competitors' assessments of item worths. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing hedonic value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.","[Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Rochester; University of Southern California; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of York - UK; University of Pennsylvania,"Phelps, CE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA.",charles.phelps@rochester.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,40,53,56,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,146,154,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010,0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477392.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000006,0

This initiative enlisted the expertise of leading health economists, including several who are not ISPOR members, to focus on what the field of health economics can provide to help inform the development and use of value assessment frameworks. The preceding seven articles represent the culmination of ISPORs Special Task Force Report on US value assessment frameworks. The following four commentaries were invited to solicit reaction from key stakeholder groups, including perspectives from payers, patients, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry. Most of the commentaries were written and presented as typical commentaries. Nevertheless, for the payer perspective, Value in Health conducted a formal interview with Brian Solow, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Optum and Edmund J. Pezalla, MD, MPH, Chief Executive Officer of Enlightenment Bioconsult LLC to discuss the use of cost effectiveness decision making among US insurers.","[Solow, Brian] Optum Life Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Pezalla, Edmund J.] Enlightenment Bioconsult, 580 Wolcott Hill Rd, Wethersfield, CT 06109 USA",Optum,"Pezalla, EJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEnlightenment Bioconsult, 580 Wolcott Hill Rd, Wethersfield, CT 06109 USA.",edmund.pezalla@enlightenmentbioconsult.com,,,,,,,0,9,12,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,166,168,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.004,0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477395.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000009,0

We revisit this relationship using the census of judicial records on criminal charges filed in Oregon Courts, the ability to separately track crimes involving firearms, and to track individuals over time. We find that crime increases at age 21, with increases mostly due to assaults that lack premeditation, and alcohol -related nuisance crimes. We find no evident increases in rape or robbery. Among those with no prior criminal records, increases in crime are 50% larger still larger for the most socially costly crimes of assault and drunk driving. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This suggests that my estimates for GDP are more accurate for countries which are considered to have more reliable GDP data. Taken together, these findings show that institutions and individuals could use social media data to corroborate official GDP estimates; or alternatively for government statistic agencies to incorporate social media data to complement and further reduce measurement errors.","[Indaco, Agustin] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Indaco, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,3,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,87,96,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8316,0,,,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000477974500011,0

Methods: We reviewed the contents of the Tufts Medical Center Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, a repository of all English language cost-perdisability-adjusted life-year averted studies indexed in PubMed. Our review included all catalogued cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year studies published from 2000 through 2015. We restricted attention to studies that investigated interventions in LMICs. Results: Our analysis identified 381 studies (80%) focused on LMICs. Of these studies, 250 (66%) cited the World Health Organization's 1 to 3 times gross domestic product per capita threshold. A full-text review of 60 (24%) of these articles (randomly selected) revealed that none justified use of this threshold in the particular country or countries studied beyond citing (generic) guideline documents. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness analysis can help inform health care spending, but its value depends on incorporating assumptions that are valid for the applicable setting. Rather than rely on commonly used, generic economic thresholds, we encourage authors to use context-specific thresholds that reflect local preferences.","[Leech, Ashley A.; Kim, David D.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Leech, AA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",aleech@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Kim, David/JTD-2751-2023","Kim, David D./0000-0002-3383-8972",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1097194]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1097194] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),This study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grant no.

These impediments, which may be unique to RDs or also apply to common diseases but are particularly pertinent in RDs, are diverse and interrelated. Objective: To develop for the first time a catalog of primary impediments to RD research and HTA, and to describe the cause and effect of individual challenges. Methods: Challenges were identified by an international 22-person expert working group and qualitative outreach to colleagues with relevant expertise. A broad range of stakeholder perspectives is represented. Draft results were presented at annual European and North American International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) congresses, and written comments were received by the 385-strong ISPOR Rare Disease Review Group from two rounds of review. Findings were refined and confirmed via targeted literature search. Results: Research-related challenges linked to the low prevalence of RDs were categorized into those pertaining to disease recognition and diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effect, and patient recruitment for clinical research. HTA-related challenges were classified into issues relating to the lack of a tailored HTA method for RD treatments and uncertainty for HTA agencies and health care payers. Conclusions: Identifying and highlighting diverse, but interrelated, key challenges in RD research and HTA is an essential first step toward developing implementable and sustainable solutions. A collaborative multistakeholder effort is required to enable faster and less costly development of safe, efficacious, and appropriate new RD therapies that offer value for money.","[Nestler-Parr, Sandra] Rare Access Ltd, Royal Leamington Spa, England; [Korchagina, Daria] Univ Paris Sud, Mental Hlth & Publ Hlth Unit, INSERM, U669, Paris, France; [Toumi, Mondher] Aix Marseille Univ, Publ Hlth & Chron Dis Lab, Marseille, France; [Pashos, Chris L.] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, Global Outcomes & Epidemiol Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Blanchette, Christopher] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Charlotte, NC USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Sci & Hlth Policy Initiat, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Morel, Thomas; Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Kalo, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, ELTE, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Gatermann, Ruediger] CSL Behring, Biotherapies Life, Healthcare Policy & External Affairs Europe, Marburg, Germany; [Redekop, William] Erasmus Univ, Hlth Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Saclay; Aix-Marseille Universite; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; KU Leuven; Eotvos Lorand University; CSL; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam","Korchagina, D (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Paris Sud, 97 Blvd Port Royal, F-75679 Paris, France.",dko@creativ-ceutical.com,"Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011; Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020","Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005; Morel, Thomas/0000-0002-0690-5359",,,,,112,67,69,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,493,500,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.004,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753344.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432175400002,0

The Flex Program created a new class of hospital, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH), which receives more generous Medicare reimbursements in return for limits on capacity and length of stay. We find that conversion to CAH status resulted in a 4.7 percent drop in inpatient admissions to participating hospitals, almost all of which was driven by factors other than capacity constraints. The Flex Program increased consumer welfare if it prevented the exit of at least 6.5 percent of randomly selected converting hospitals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Newly constructed historical data on drug-trafficking organizations' areas of operation at the municipality level and monthly homicide data allow us to control for a rich set of fixed effects and to leverage variation in the timing of kingpin captures to estimate their effects. This analysis indicates that kingpin captures cause large and sustained increases to the homicide rate in the municipality of capture and smaller but significant effects on other municipalities where the kingpin's organization has a presence, supporting the notion that removing kingpins can have destabilizing effects throughout an organization that are accompanied by escalations in violence. We also find reductions in homicides in municipalities surrounding the municipality where kingpins are captured. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a novel three-step procedure to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the first step, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventional factor model on each interval. In the second step, we apply the adaptive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the third step, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the break on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching one our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the break locations.

However, in many settings, a medication and its substitutes and complements face simultaneous differential changes in prices that affect the observed composite PED. We exploit an implementation of a value-based formulary (VBF) that utilized drug-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to inform drug copayments, resulting in increases in copayments for some medications and decreases in copayments for others. We first show theoretically that by changing the price of a medication and its substitute in opposite directions, VBF designs can leverage cross-price effects to increase the range of composite PEDs. We then empirically estimate PED and welfare effects using a consumer surplus approach. Overall PED was -0.16, similar to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment estimate. However, there was substantial dispersion of PED across the VBF copayment tiers ranging from -0.09 to -0.87 with a statistically significant trend aligned with the levels of value as reflected by the ICER estimates (p<0.001). The net welfare increase was $147,000 for the cohort or $28 per member over the postpolicy year. Further experimentations of VBF designs with alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds, copayment levels and value definitions could be quite promising for improving welfare.","[Yeung, Kai; Basu, Anirban; Hansen, Ryan N.; Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,Room H-375, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Yeung, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,Room H-375, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kaiy@u.washington.edu,,"Basu, Anirban/0000-0003-4238-7402",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R36-11639393]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [TL1-TR000422],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)),"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Grant/Award Number: R36-11639393; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Grant/Award Number: TL1-TR000422",,29,11,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1788,1804,,10.1002/hec.3801,0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,30028050.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446323300010,0

In other disciplines, a Bayesian approach known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is far more popular. This paper connects these two seemingly related approaches to likelihood-free estimation by means of a Reverse Sampler that uses both optimization and importance weighting to target the posterior distribution. Its hybrid features enable us to analyze an ABC estimate from the perspective of SMD. We show that an ideal ABC estimate can be obtained as a weighted average of a sequence of SMD modes, each being the minimizer of the deviations between the data and the model. This contrasts with the SMD, which is the mode of the average deviations. Using stochastic expansions, we provide a general characterization of frequentist estimators and those based on Bayesian computations including Laplace-type estimators. Their differences are illustrated using analytical examples and a simulation study of the dynamic panel model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Since the integrated volatility matrix often has entries with a wide range of variability, universal thresholding estimators do not take the varying entries into consideration and may have unsatisfactory performances. This paper investigates adaptive thresholding estimation of the large integrated volatility matrix. We first construct an estimator for the asymptotic variance of the pre-averaging realized volatility estimator and then use the two estimators to develop an adaptive thresholding estimator of the large volatility matrix. It is shown that the adaptive thresholding estimator can achieve the optimal rate of convergence over the class of the sparse integrated volatility matrix when both the number of assets and sample size are allowed to go to infinity, while the universal thresholding estimator can achieve only the sub-optimal convergence rate. Also we discuss how to harness the adaptive thresholding scheme in the approximate factor model. The simulation study is conducted to check the finite sample performance of the adaptive thresholding estimators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Study groups included patients randomized to adalimumab or placebo (REVEAL and CHAMPION trials) and those randomized to etanercept or placebo (M10-114 and M10-315 trials). Week 12 outcomes were compared between patients receiving adalimumab and those receiving etanercept after adjusting for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics using propensity score weighting and after subtracting effects of placebo. Outcomes included proportion of patients achieving 75% or more, 90% or more, and 100% reductions from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75, PASI90, PASI100, respectively), symptom resolution (pruritus = 0; psoriatic pain = 0), lesion resolution (minimal scores for plaque signs erythema, desquamation, and induration, and by body regions head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), absence of skin-related quality-of-life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] = 0), complete disease control (patient's global assessment [PtGA] = 0), and adverse events. RESULTS: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were balanced among study groups (adalimumab = 875 vs. placebo = 427; etanercept = 260 vs. placebo = 130). Compared with etanercept, adalimumab was associated with significantly better placebo-adjusted outcomes (PASI75: 62.3% vs. 42.6%; PASI90: 35.9% vs. 12.1%; PASI100: 13.1% vs. 4.9%; pruritus: 24.7% vs. 13.0%; psoriatic pain: 27.4% vs. 8.7%; DLQI: 27.7% vs. 11.7%; and PtGA: 16.4% vs. 10.6%; all P < 0.05), except for similar rates of adverse events and head-specific lesion resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with etanercept, adalimumab treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was associated with greater PASI reduction, higher rates of resolution of skin signs and symptoms, and greater improvements in dermatological life quality.

Although most programs incentivize formal health providers, some constraints to utilization might be better alleviated by incentivizing other actors in the health care system. This paper presents results from a randomized controlled trial set to evaluate the effects of two incentive schemes that were introduced on top of Rwanda's national Performance-Based Financing program at the health facility level. One scheme rewarded community health worker cooperatives for the utilization of five services by their communities. The second scheme provided in-kind transfers to users of three services. The analysis finds no impact of the cooperative performance payments on coverage of the targeted services, behaviors of community health workers, or outcomes at the cooperative level. Although health centers experienced frequent stock outs of the gifts, the demand-side intervention significantly increased timely antenatal care by 9.3 percentage points and timely postnatal care by 8.6 percentage points. This study shows that demand-side incentives can increase service utilization also when provided in addition to a supply-side pay-for-performance scheme.","[Shapira, Gil] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Mailstop MC 3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kalisa, Ina; Humuza, James] Univ Rwanda, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Kigali, Rwanda; [Condo, Jeanine] Rwanda Biomed Ctr, Kigali, Rwanda; [Mugeni, Cathy; Nkunda, Denis] Minist Hlth, Kigali, Rwanda; [Walldorf, Jeanette] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",The World Bank; University of Rwanda; Rwanda Biomedical Center; Copenhagen Business School,"Shapira, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåWorld Bank, Dev Res Grp, Mailstop MC 3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gshapira@worldbank.org,,,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,,36,12,12,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2018,27.0,12.0,,,,,2087,2106,,10.1002/hec.3822,0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GZ7PM,30159944.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000449674000012,0

Symptoms include bone pain, joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Published evidence regarding the patient experience of XLH is sparse and no XLH-specific outcome measures have been validated. Objectives: To understand the symptoms, impacts, and patient experience of XLH and to evaluate the face and content validity of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC (R)) and the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) for use as end points in XLH clinical trials. Methods: Face-to-face, qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 adults with XLH in the United States using concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing techniques. Openended questioning elicited spontaneous concepts focusing on XLH-associated symptoms and functional limitations. Cognitive debriefing of the WOMAC (R) and BPI-SF assessed the relevance and patient understanding of item wording, recall period, and response options. Results: Various distinct symptom concepts were elicited including pain symptoms, dental symptoms, sensory symptoms, tiredness/ fatigue symptoms, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Participants reported experiencing significant bone and joint pain, stiffness, mobility limitations, and an impact on their ability to work. Cognitive interviewing found both instruments to be relevant and well understood by most patients. Conclusions: The interviews generated rich, qualitative insights into the patient experience of XLH. Cognitive debriefing of the BPI-SF and WOMAC (R) supported their value as XLH clinical trial end points. Future research will assess the psychometric properties of these instruments for use in the XLH population.","[Theodore-Oklota, Christina; Chen, Chao-Yin; Skrinar, Alison] Ultragenyx Pharmaceut, Novato, CA USA; [Bonner, Nicola; Spencer, Holly; Arbuckle, Rob] Adelphi Values, Bollington, Cheshire, England",Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.; Adelphi Group Ltd,"Bonner, N (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAdelphi Mill, Adelphis, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",nicola.bonner@adelphiavalues.com,,,"Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","This project was funded by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA), which commissioned Adelphi Values (Bollington, Cheshire, UK).",,28,20,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,AUG,2018,21.0,8.0,,,,,973,983,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.013,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GP7IX,30098676.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000441071700011,0

Second, to assess whether longer times to launch or lack of launches affected medicines with high or low expected additional clinical benefit. Third, to identify possible determinants of the probability of a cancer medicine to be launched. Methods: Correlation between time to launch and a set of variables hypothesized to affect launch was tested using a complementary log-log model for a sample of 46 cancer medicines that obtained EU-wide marketing authorization between 2000 and 2014. Results: In median, for a sample of 24 cancer medicines that obtained marketing authorization between 2010 and 2014, the expected time from EU-wide marketing authorization to first use of a medicine was shortest in Sweden, 3.1 months, followed by Scotland (9.3 months), Belgium (14.8 months), and Estonia (27.8 months). Median times to launch were longer for the entire sample of 46 cancer medicines that obtained marketing authorization between 2000 and 2014. In the all-country model, medicines with shorter times to submission for reimbursement, local manufacturers headquarter (or local sales representative), and a Food and Drugs Administration priority review or a combination of expedited approval programs and medicines launched in Scotland and Sweden were associated with a higher hazard of launch. Longer times since EU-wide approval initially correlate with an increased hazard but as time further elapses they negatively affect the hazard of launch. Conclusions: Median times from marketing authorization to first use of cancer medicines were shorter for medicines launched between 2010 and 2014 versus sample-wide (2000-2014). In Estonia, more medicines than in the other countries were not yet launched at the end of the observation period. There was no correlation between Prescrire and European School of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale ratings of added clinical value and time to launch.","[Ferrario, Alessandra] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ferrario, Alessandra] Harvard Pilgr Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Ferrario, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Ferrario, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Pilgr Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",alessandra_ferrario@harverdpilgrim.org,,"Ferrario, Alessandra/0000-0002-1572-3581",,,,,29,19,19,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,809,821,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.003,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005753.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438314900008,0

Outcomes can be beneficial (e.g. increased survival or cure rates) or detrimental (e.g. adverse events, pain associated with treatment, treatment costs, time required for treatment). Treatment effects may also be heterogeneous across outcomes and across patients. Randomized controlled trials are usually insufficient to supply evidence across outcomes. Observational data analysis is an alternative, with the caveat that the treatments observed are choices. Real-world treatment choice often involves complex assessment of expected effects across the array of outcomes. Failure to account for this complexity when interpreting treatment effect estimates could lead to clinical and policy mistakes. Objective Our objective was to assess the properties of treatment effect estimates based on choice when treatments have heterogeneous effects on both beneficial and detrimental outcomes across patients. Methods Simulation methods were used to highlight the sensitivity of treatment effect estimates to the distributions of treatment effects across patients across outcomes. Scenarios with alternative correlations between benefit and detriment treatment effects across patients were used. Regression and instrumental variable estimators were applied to the simulated data for both outcomes. Results True treatment effect parameters are sensitive to the relationships of treatment effectiveness across outcomes in each study population. In each simulation scenario, treatment effect estimate interpretations for each outcome are aligned with results shown previously in single outcome models, but these estimates vary across simulated populations with the correlations of treatment effects across patients across outcomes. Conclusion If estimator assumptions are valid, estimates across outcomes can be used to assess the optimality of treatment rates in a study population. However, because true treatment effect parameters are sensitive to correlations of treatment effects across outcomes, decision makers should be cautious about generalizing estimates to other populations.","[Brooks, John M.] Univ South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Brooks, John M.] Ctr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Univ South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303B, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Ctr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303B, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Schroeder, Mary C.] Univ Iowa, Coll Pharm, 115 S Grand Ave,Room S525, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Iowa,"Brooks, JM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.;Brooks, JM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCtr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",john-brooks@sc.edu; cole-chapman@sc.edu; mary-schroeder@uiowa.edu,"Brooks, John Matthew/HLW-2505-2023; Brooks, John/R-3585-2019","Brooks, John Matthew/0000-0001-7365-4417; Chapman, Cole/0000-0002-1132-3767",Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) [ME-1303-6011],Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)(Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute - PCORI),This project was funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) under project number (ME-1303-6011).,,48,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We randomly assigned health workers to different gift treatments within a program that visited health workers, measured performance and encouraged them to provide high quality care for their patients. We show that unconditional non-monetary gifts improve performance by 20 percent over a six-week period, compared to the control group. We compare the impact of the unconditional gift to one in which a gift is offered conditional on meeting a performance target and show that only the unconditional gift results in a statistically significant improvement. This demonstrates that organizations can improve the performance of health workers in the medium term without using financial incentives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Brock, J.

Methods: We conducted focus groups/telephone-based interviews and surveys to understand perceptions of RWE and assess awareness, quality, and relevance of two high-profile examples of published RWE studies. A purposive sample comprised 4 physicians, 15 pharmacists, and 1 researcher representing 18 US health plans and health system organizations. Results: Participants reported that RWE was generally used, or useful, to inform safety monitoring, utilization management, and cost analysis, but less so to guide P&T decisions. Participants were not aware of the two sample RWE studies but considered both studies to be valuable. Relevant research questions and outcomes, transparent methods, study quality, and timely results contribute to the utility of published RWE. Perceived organizational barriers to the use of published RWE included lack of skill, training, and timely study results. Conclusions: Payers recognize the value of RWE, but use of such studies to inform P&T decisions varies from organization to organization and is limited. Relevance to payers, timeliness, and transparent methods were key concerns with RWE. Participants recognized the need for continuing education on evaluating and using RWE to better understand the study methods, findings, and applicability to their organizations.","[Malone, Daniel C.; Brown, Mary; Peters, Loretta] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, 1295 N Martin,POB 210202, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hurwitz, Jason T.] Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & Pharmacoecon Res, Tucson, AZ USA; [Graff, Jennifer S.] Natl Pharmaceut Council, Washington, DC USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Malone, DC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Arizona, Coll Pharm, 1295 N Martin,POB 210202, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",malone@pharmacy.arizona.edu,,"Hurwitz, Jason/0000-0003-3879-9877",National Pharmaceutical Council,National Pharmaceutical Council,This project was funded by the National Pharmaceutical Council.,,29,44,47,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,326,333,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3013,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566840.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428019200012,0

Methods: In April 2016, an exploratory survey was fielded: 4074 US respondents completed 20 out of 1560 paired comparisons by choosing between two health descriptions (e.g., longer life span vs. better health). The exploratory data were distributed to all teams. By July, eight teams had submitted their predictions for 1600 additional pairs and described their analytical approach. After these predictions had been posted online, a confirmatory survey was fielded (4148 additional respondents). Results: The victorious team, Discreetly Charming Econometricians, led by Michal Jakubczyk, achieved the smallest chi(2), 4391.54 (a predefined criterion). Its primary scientific findings were that different models performed better with different pairs, that the value of life span is not constant proportional, and that logit models have poor predictive validity in health valuation. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the diversity and potential of new analytical approaches in health preference research and highlighted the importance of predictive validity in health valuation.","[Jakubczyk, Michal] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CMC206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Barra, Mathias; Rand, Kim] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway; [Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

Specifically, an autoregressive conditional Frechet (AcF) model is proposed in which the maxima are modeled by a Frechet distribution with time-varying scale parameter (volatility) and shape parameter (tail index) conditioned on past information. The AcF provides a direct and accurate modeling of the time-varying behavior of maxima and furthermore offers a new angle to study the tail risk dynamics in financial markets. Probabilistic properties of AcF are studied, and a maximum likelihood estimator is used for model estimation, with its statistical properties investigated. Simulations show the flexibility of AcF and confirm the reliability of its estimators. Two real data examples on cross-sectional stock returns and high-frequency foreign exchange returns are used to demonstrate the AcF modeling approach, where significant improvement over the static GEV has been observed for market tail risk monitoring and conditional VaR estimation. Empirical result of AcF is consistent with the findings of the dynamic peak-over-threshold (POT) literature that the tail index of financial markets varies through time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, an undesirable feature of a high dimensional factor model is that the model has too many parameters. An effective way to address this issue, proposed in a seminar work by Tsai and Tsay (2010) is to decompose the loadings matrix by a high-dimensional known matrix multiplying with a low-dimensional unknown matrix, which Tsai and Tsay (2010) name the constrained factor models. This paper investigates the estimation and inferential theory of constrained factor models under large-N and large-T setup, where N denotes the number of cross sectional units and T the time periods. We propose using the quasi maximum likelihood method to estimate the model and investigate the asymptotic properties of the quasi maximum likelihood estimators, including consistency, rates of convergence and limiting distributions. A new statistic is proposed for testing the null hypothesis of constrained factor models against the alternative of standard factor models. Partially constrained factor models are also investigated. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that the quasi maximum likelihood estimators and the proposed new statistic perform well in finite samples. We also consider the extension to an approximate constrained factor model where the idiosyncratic errors are allowed to be weakly dependent processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A broad array of international stakeholders involved in oncology drug development and PRO measurement science provided perspectives on the role of PRO measures to provide complementary clinical data on the symptomatic side effects of anticancer agents. Speakers and panelists explored the utility of information derived from existing and emerging PRO measures, focusing on the PRO version of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Panelists and speakers discussed potential ways to improve the collection, analysis, and presentation of PRO data describing symptomatic adverse events to support drug development and better inform regulatory and treatment decisions. Workshop participants concluded the day with a discussion of possible approaches to the patient-reported assessment of an investigational drug's overall side effect burden as a potential clinical trial end point. The Food and Drug Administration reiterated its commitment to collaborate with international drug development stakeholders to identify rigorous methods to incorporate the patient perspective into the development of cancer therapeutics.","[Kluetz, Paul G.] US FDA, Oncol Ctr Excellence, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Kanapuru, Bindu; Lemery, Steven; Johnson, Laura Lee; Fiero, Mallorie H.; Campbell, Michelle; Daniels, Selena; Sridhara, Rajeshwari] US FDA, Ctr Drug Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Arscott, Karen] Geisinger Commonwealth Sch Med, Scranton, PA USA; [Barbachano, Yolanda; O'Connor, Daniel] Med & Healthcare Prod Regulatory Agcy, London, England; [Basch, Ethan] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Cappelleri, Joseph C.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Cleeland, Charles] UT MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Internal Med, Dept Symptom Res, Houston, TX USA; [Coens, Corneel] European Org Res & Treatment Canc EORTC HQ, Qual Life Dept, Brussels, Belgium; [Denlinger, Crystal S.] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, 7701 Burholme Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA; [Fairclough, Dianne L.] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Informat, Aurora, CO USA; [Minasian, Lori; Mitchell, Sandra A.] NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Patel, Sheetal] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Rubin, Eric H.] Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Ryden, Anna] AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Soltys, Katherine] Hlth Canada, Therapeut Prod Directorate, Hlth Prod & Food Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thanarajasingam, Gita] Mayo Clin, Div Hematol, Rochester, MN USA; [Velikova, Galina] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Canc & Pathol, St Jamess Inst Oncol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Coons, Stephen Joel] Crit Path Inst, Patient Reported Outcome Consortium, Tucson, AZ USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Pfizer; Robert H.

Methods: Patients' experiences of CDI symptoms were elicited in open-ended discussions with patients and nurses at five US sites (stage 1). A draft PRO measure was developed after demonstration of concept saturation. Two rounds of cognitive interviews were conducted with patients at three US sites (stage 2), with revision of the draft measure after each round. All patients were 18 years or older, with confirmed CDI. The study was conducted with input from a panel of five CDI experts in Europe and North America. Results: Stage 1 included interviews with 18 patients and supplementary interviews with 6 nurses; 16 additional patients were interviewed in stage 2. Patients were representative of the general CDI population and were diverse in age, sex, and disease severity. Concept saturation was reached in stage 1. Items were organized in a draft conceptual framework with five hypothesized domains: diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, tiredness, lightheadedness, and other symptoms. Stage 2 demonstrated initial content validity of the 13-item draft daily diary (CDIDaySyms). Participants reported that the questions were clear, relevant, and comprehensive. They were able to use the instructions to complete the diary correctly and considered the 24-hour recall period appropriate. Conclusions: The CDI-DaySyms captures symptoms relevant to patients undergoing CDI, demonstrating initial content validity. Final content and psychometric validity are being evaluated in a substudy comprising patients from two ongoing international clinical trials (Clinic alTrial s. gov identifiers NCT01987895 and NCT01983683).","[Kleinman, Leah] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Talbot, George H.] Talbot Advisors LLC, Anna Maria, FL USA; [Hunsche, Elke; Schuler, Rene] Actel Pharmaceut Ltd, Allschwil, Switzerland; [Nord, Carl Erik] Karolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, F68, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden",Evidera; Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital,"Nord, CE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåKarolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, F68, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.",carl.erik.nord@ki.se,,,"Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland","Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland","This study was funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland.

Methods: Three specific contexts are examined, drawing on recent experience. First, an effective new treatment for a chronic, progressive disease, such as hepatitis C, creates a budget spike that is transitory because initial prevalence is high, relative to current incidence. Second, cures that potentially provide lifetime benefits may claim abnormally high VBP prices, with high immediate budget impact potentially/partially offset by deferred cost savings. Third, although orphan drugs in principle target rare diseases, in aggregate they pose affordability concerns because of the growing number of orphan indications and increasingly high prices. Results: For mass diseases, the transitory budget impact of treating the accumulated patient stock can be managed by stratified rollout that delays treatment of stable patients and prioritizes patients at high risk of deterioration. Delay spreads the budget impact and permits potential savings from launch of competing treatments. For cures, installment payments contingent on outcomes could align payment flows and appropriately shift risk to producers. This approach, however, entails high administrative and incentive costs, especially if applied across multiple payers in the United States. For orphan drugs, the available evidence on research and development trends and returns argues against the need for a higher VBP threshold to incentivize research and development in orphan drugs, given existing statutory benefits under orphan drug legislation.","[Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Danzon, PM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Wharton Sch, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",danzon@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,13,33,36,2,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,252,257,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.018,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566830.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428019200002,0

We discuss the role of budgets, thresholds, opportunity costs, and affordability in making decisions. First, we discuss the use of budgets and thresholds in private and public health plans, their interdependence, and connection to opportunity cost. Essentially, each payer should adopt a decision rule about what is good value for money given their budget; consistent use of a cost-per-quality adjusted life-year threshold will ensure the maximum health gain for the budget. In the United States, different public and private insurance programs could use different thresholds, reflecting the differing generosity of their budgets and implying different levels of access to technologies. In addition, different insurance plans could consider different additional elements to the quality-adjusted life-year metric discussed elsewhere in our Special Task Force report. We then define affordability and discuss approaches to deal with it, including consideration of disinvestment and related adjustment costs, the impact of delaying new technologies, and comparative cost effectiveness of technologies. Over time, the availability of new technologies may increase the amount that populations want to spend on health care. We then discuss potential modifiers to thresholds, including uncertainty about the evidence used in the decision-making process. This article concludes by discussing the application of these concepts in the context of the pluralistic US health care system, as well as the excess burden of tax-financed public programs versus private programs.","[Danzon, Patricia M.; Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",University of Pennsylvania; University of York - UK,"Danzon, PM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",danzon@wharton.upenn.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,,,,,14,42,42,4,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,140,145,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.008,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477391.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000005,0

In the traditional statistical approach, we first use observations to estimate the parameters of an appropriate model, and then use the resulting estimates to make predictions. Recently, a relatively new predictive approach has been actively promoted, the approach where we make predictions directly from observations. It is known that in general, while the predictive approach requires more computations, it leads to more accurate predictions. In this paper, on the practically important example of robust interval uncertainty, we analyze how more accurate is the predictive approach. Our analysis shows that predictive models are indeed much more accurate: asymptotically, they lead to estimates which are root n more accurate, where n is the number of estimated parameters.","[Kreinovich, Vladik; Kosheleva, Olga] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Comp Sci, 500 W Univ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Nguyen, Hung T.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Nguyen, Hung T.; Sriboonchitta, Songsak] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; New Mexico State University; Chiang Mai University,"Kreinovich, V (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas El Paso, Dept Comp Sci, 500 W Univ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",vladik@utep.edu; hunguyen@nmsu.edu; songsakecon@gmail.com; olgak@utep.edu,,"yamaka, woraphon/0000-0002-0787-1437","Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand; National Science Foundation [HRD-0734825, HRD-1242122, DUE-0926721]; Prudential Foundation","Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Prudential Foundation","We acknowledge the partial support of the Center of Excellence in Econometrics, Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

METHODS: This retrospective analysis of the Medicare 5% Limited Data Set for calendar year 2014 included beneficiaries who experienced episodes of care for one or more of the following: arterial ulcers, chronic ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, diabetic infections, pressure ulcers, skin disorders, skin infections, surgical wounds, surgical infections, traumatic wounds, venous ulcers, or venous infections. The main outcomes were the prevalence of each wound type, Medicare expenditure for each wound type and aggregate, and expenditure by type of service. RESULTS: Nearly 15% of Medicare beneficiaries (8.2 million) had at least one type of wound or infection (not pneumonia). Surgical infections were the largest prevalence category (4.0%), followed by diabetic infections (3.4%). Total Medicare spending estimates for all wound types ranged from $28.1 to $96.8 billion. Including infection costs, the most expensive estimates were for surgical wounds ($11.7, $13.1, and $38.3 billion), followed by diabetic foot ulcers ($6.2, $6.9, and $18.7 billion,). The highest cost estimates in regard to site of service were for hospital outpatients ($9.9-$35.8 billion), followed by hospital inpatients ($5.0-$24.3 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare expenditures related to wound care are far greater than previously recognized, with care occurring largely in outpatient settings. The data could be used to develop more appropriate quality measures and reimbursement models, which are needed for better health outcomes and smarter spending for this growing population.

The national program built on preexisting local programs in some, but not all, departements. Using data from multiple waves of a nationally representative biennial survey of the French population, we estimate the effect of organized screening on the percentage of women obtaining a mammogram. The analysis uses difference-in-differences methods to exploit the fact that the program was targeted at women in a specific age group: 50 to 74 years old. We find that organized screening significantly raised mammography rates among women in the target age range. Just above the lower age threshold, the percentage of women reporting that they had a mammogram in the past 2 years increased by over 10 percentage points after the national program went into effect. Mammography rates increased even more among women in their 60s. Estimated effects are particularly large for women with less education and lower incomes, suggesting that France's organized screening program has reduced socioeconomic disparities in access to mammography.","[Buchmueller, Thomas C.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buchmueller, Thomas C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldzahl, Leontine] Univ Manchester, Sch Hlth Sci, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Goldzahl, Leontine] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Manchester; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Buchmueller, TC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tbuch@umich.edu,,"Buchmueller, Thomas/0000-0002-3068-7419; Goldzahl, Leontine/0000-0001-6070-3347",chair Sante at the Fondation du risque; [ANR 11-LABX-0019],chair Sante at the Fondation du risque;,"Goldzahl's work on this paper was supported by a post-doctoral grant co-financed by the chair Sante at the Fondation du risque and the project ANR 11-LABX-0019.

The Vickrey auction is DSIC and efficient, but raises surplus revenue. In an environment where players have constant marginal values, we introduce a subsidized Vickrey auction (SVA) that uses surplus revenue to offset some of the production costs. By compromising efficiency, our SVA improves the players' payoffs over the Vickrey auction. We show that the SVA is DSIC, budget balanced, and value effective (awarding quantity only to the player who values it most), and it Pareto dominates any other mechanism with these three properties. We demonstrate that there is no welfare ranking between the SVA and the non-value effective serial cost-sharing mechanism.

Inverse probability weighted regression models have been developed to address the challenge of cost censoring in order to identify intent-to-treat effects (i.e., to compare mean costs between groups on the basis of their initial treatment assignment, irrespective of any subsequent changes to their treatment status). In this paper, we describe a nested g-computation procedure that can be used to compare mean costs between two or more time-varying treatment regimes. We highlight the relative advantages and limitations of this approach when compared with existing regression-based models. We illustrate the utility of this approach as a means to inform public policy by applying it to a simulated data example motivated by costs associated with cancer treatments. Simulations confirm that inference regarding intent-to-treat effects versus the joint causal effects estimated by the nested g-formula can lead to markedly different conclusions regarding differential costs. Therefore, it is essential to prespecify the desired target of inference when choosing between these two frameworks. The nested g-formula should be considered as a useful, complementary tool to existing methods when analyzing cost outcomes.","[Spieker, Andrew; Roy, Jason; Mitra, Nandita] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, 423 Guardian Dr,1313 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Spieker, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Dept Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, 423 Guardian Dr,1313 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",aspieker@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,,"Spieker, Andrew/0000-0002-0548-8311",NIH [R01 GM 112327],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"NIH, Grant/Award Number: R01 GM 112327.",,11,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUL,2018,27.0,7.0,,,,,1063,1073,,10.1002/hec.3651,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GI2SF,29663579.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000434221500002,0

We employ double asymptotics under which both the cross-sectional sample size and the length of time series tend to infinity and utilize the sieve AR approximation with its lag order increasing with the sample size. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the fixed effects estimator and propose a bias-corrected fixed effects estimator based on a theoretical asymptotic bias term. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the usefulness of bias correction. As an illustration, the proposed methods are applied to dynamic panel estimation of the law of one price deviations among US cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When these data exist, analyses tend to focus on rural environments. In this paper, we study the effects that health facility access and quality have on contraceptive use and desired number of children for women in urban Senegal. Unlike related studies focusing on rural environments, we find no evidence that greater access to health facilities and pharmacies increases contraceptive use among urban women. However, we do find that contraceptive use among urban women is higher with greater facility quality. For example, we find that increasing the proportion of pharmacies employing multiple pharmacists from 0% to 50% would increase contraceptive use by 6.0 percentage points, and increasing the proportion of facilities with family planning guidelines/protocols from 50% to 100% would increase use by 2.1 percentage points.","[Cronin, Christopher J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 916 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Guilkey, David K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Guilkey, David K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Speizer, Ilene S.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Speizer, Ilene S.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Notre Dame; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Cronin, CJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 916 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ccronin1@nd.edu,,"Cronin, Christopher/0000-0002-6348-4175",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [52037]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5 R24 HD050924],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 52037; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Grant/Award Number: 5 R24 HD050924",,38,14,14,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,576,591,,10.1002/hec.3615,0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29094775.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428324700015,0

Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four antibiotic prophylaxis strategies: ciprofloxacin alone, ceftriaxone alone, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone in combination, and directed prophylaxis selection based on susceptibility testing. We used a payer's perspective and estimated the health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each strategy for a cohort of 66-year-old men undergoing TRPB. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Base-case resistance prevalence was 29% to ciprofloxacin and 7% to ceftriaxone, reflecting susceptibility patterns observed at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Resistance levels were varied in sensitivity analysis. Results: In the base case, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were dominated. Directed prophylaxis strategy was the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. Relative to the directed prophylaxis strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the combination strategy was $123,333/QALY gained over the lifetime time horizon. In sensitivity analysis, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were preferred only at extreme levels of resistance. Conclusions: Directed or combination prophylaxis strategies were optimal for a wide range of resistance levels. Facilities using single-agent antibiotic prophylaxis strategies before TRPB should re-evaluate their strategies unless extremely low levels of antimicrobial resistance are documented.","[Lee, Kyueun] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Redwood Bldg T261, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Drekonja, Dimitri M.] Minneapolis Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Drekonja, Dimitri M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Internal Med, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Enns, Eva A.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN USA",Stanford University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Lee, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Redwood Bldg T261, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kyueunl@stanford.edu,"Drekonja, Dimitri/JXL-9620-2024","Drekonja, Dimitri/0000-0002-6993-4704; Lee, Kyueun/0000-0002-0013-4733",,,,,37,5,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,310,317,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3016,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566838.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428019200010,0

The Special Task Force chose to take a health economics approach to the question of whether a health plan should cover and reimburse a specific technology, beginning with the view that the conventional cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year metric has both strengths as a starting point and recognized limitations. This report calls for the development of a more comprehensive economic evaluation that could include novel elements of value (e.g., insurance value and equity) as part of either an augmented cost-effectiveness analysis or a multicriteria decision analysis. Given an aggregation of elements to a measure of value, consistent use of a cost-effectiveness threshold can help ensure the maximization of health gain and well-being for a given budget. These decisions can benefit from the use of deliberative processes. The six recommendations are to: 1) be explicit about decision context and perspective in value assessment frameworks; 2) base health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions on an evaluation of the incremental costs and benefits of health care technologies as is provided by cost-effectiveness analysis; 3) develop value thresholds to serve as one important input to help guide coverage and reimbursement decisions; 4) manage budget constraints and affordability on the basis of cost-effectiveness principles; 5) test and consider using structured deliberative processes for health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions; and 6) explore and test novel elements of benefit to improve value measures that reflect the perspectives of both plan members and patients.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Danzon, Patricia M.; Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, Polit Sci, Gualala, CA USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Gen Internal Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Tufts Medical Center; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of York - UK; University of Southern California; University of Rochester; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University,"Garrison, LP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, POB 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@uw.edu,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011; Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042;",,,,,6,105,110,1,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,161,165,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009,0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477394.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000008,0

We ask respondents to report information about their willingness to pay for health risk reductions that are different from those used in earlier valuation work because they are comprised of two probabilities that of getting cancer, and that of dying from it (conditional on getting it in the first place). The product of these two probabilities is the unconditional cancer mortality risk. Our hypothetical risk reductions also include two severity-related attributes quality-of-life impacts and pain. The results show that respondents did appear to have an intuitive grasp of compound probabilities, and took into account each component of the unconditional cancer mortality risk when answering the valuation questions. We estimate the cancer VSL to be between approximately 2 and 5.950 million, depending on whether the (unconditional) mortality risk was reduced by lowering the chance of getting cancer, increasing the chance of surviving cancer, or both. The VSCC is estimated to be up to 0.578 million euro, and its magnitude depends on the initial (conditional) cancer mortality and on the improvement in survival. The survey responses show that our measures of cancer severity impacts on daily activities and pain have little or no effect on the WTP to reduce the adverse health risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we treat the problem as follows: beginning with a binary relation greater than or similar to on events that does not preclude a probabilistic interpretation, in the sense that greater than or similar to has extensions that are probabilistically representable, we characterize the extension greater than or similar to(+) of greater than or similar to that is exactly the intersection of all probabilistically representable extensions of greater than or similar to. This extension greater than or similar to(+) gives us all the additional comparisons that we are entitled to infer from greater than or similar to, based on the assumption that there is some probability measure of which greater than or similar to gives us partial qualitative information. We pay special attention to the problem of extending an order on states to an order on events. In addition to the probabilistic interpretation, this problem has a more general interpretation involving measurement of any additive quantity: e.g., given comparisons between the weights of individual objects, what comparisons between the weights of groups of objects can we infer?

Specifically, we study the impact of the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative, a multi-payer program that requires providers to enter into EBP arrangements for perinatal care, covering the majority of births in the state. Unlike fee-for-service reimbursement, EBP holds physicians responsible for all care within a discrete episode, rewarding physicians for efficient use of their own services and for efficient management of other health care inputs. In a difference-in-differences analysis of commercial claims, we find that perinatal spending in Arkansas decreased by 3.8% overall under EBP, compared to surrounding states. The decrease was driven by reduced spending on non-physician health care inputs, specifically the prices paid for inpatient facility care. We additionally find a limited improvement in quality of care under EBP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A cross-sectional and longitudinal design was used to assess the PerfO measurement properties using the US Food and Drug Administration guidance for industry around patient-reported outcome measures to support labeling claims. Patient-reported outcome measures and patient- and clinician-reported global concept items were completed along with four PerfO measures at visit 1 and two follow-up visits. Measurement properties assessed included reliability, construct validity, ability to detect change, and estimates of meaningful change. Results: A total of 280 patients (100 eTHR, 105 eTKR, and 75 HF) were recruited, with most (n = 276) providing data at visit 1. Most of the patients were female (64%) and retired (64%), and had at least one comorbidity (91%). Inter-rater and test-retest reliability ranged from good to excellent (0.73 < intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.95) for each PerfO measure. Known-groups validity was demonstrated for all PerfO measures, with those reporting less pain better physical functioning and those who did not use an assistive device having quicker mean completion times. Construct validity and ability to detect change were demonstrated and estimates of meaningful change derived. Conclusions: This study found the measurement properties of four PerfO measures in samples of patients with eTHR, eTKR, and HF to be supported for consideration of future use, and provided estimates for interpretation of change.","[Doll, Helen; Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Gentile, Brittany] ICON Clin Res, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bush, Elizabeth Nicole] Eli Lilly & Co, Patient Focused Outcomes Ctr Expertise, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; Eli Lilly,"Ballinger, R (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåICON Clin Res UK Ltd, 100 Pk Dr,Milton Pk, Abingdon OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",rachel.ballinger@iconplc.com,,"Gentile, Brittany/0000-0002-6302-5593",Eli Lilly and Co.,Eli Lilly and Co.(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co.,,34,14,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1104,1114,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.006,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224116.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444833500014,0

We examine the impact of this development on mortality among adults and the elderly by exploiting the variation in the timing of the deployment and the intensity of expansion of gas networks across provinces using data from 2001 to 2016. The results indicate that the expansion of natural gas has caused significant reductions in mortality among both adults and the elderly. These findings are supported by our auxiliary analysis, which demonstrates that the expansion of natural gas networks might have led to a significant improvement in air quality. Furthermore, we show that the mortality gains are primarily driven by reductions in cardiorespiratory deaths, which are more likely to be due to conditions caused or exacerbated by air pollution.

Our proposed methodology removes unobserved fixed effects from the model by transforming the latter into a semiparametric additive model, however avoids using backfitting technique. We derive the limiting results for the proposed estimators and construct a consistent nonparametric test to test for spatial endogeneity. A small Monte Carlo study shows that our proposed estimators and test statistic exhibit good finite-sample performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVES: To develop precise algorithms based on medication claims/prescriber visits (MCs/PVs) to identify psoriasis (PsO) patients and psoriatic patients with arthritic conditions (PsO-AC), a proxy for psoriatic arthritis, in Canadian databases lacking diagnosis codes. METHODS: Algorithms were developed using medications with narrow indication profiles in combination with prescriber specialty to define PsO and PsO-AC. For a 3-year study period from July 1, 2009, algorithms were validated using the PharMetrics Plus database, which contains both adjudicated medication claims and diagnosis codes. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the developed algorithms were assessed using diagnosis code as the reference standard. Chosen algorithms were then applied to Canadian drug databases to profile the algorithm-identified PsO and PsO-AC cohorts. RESULTS: In the selected database, 183,328 patients were identified for validation. The highest PPVs for PsO (85%) and PsO-AC (65%) occurred when a predictive algorithm of two or more MCs/PVs was compared with the reference standard of one or more diagnosis codes. NPV and specificity were high (99%-100%), whereas sensitivity was low (=30%). Reducing the number of MCs/PVs or increasing diagnosis claims decreased the algorithms' PPVs. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an MC/PV-based algorithm to identify PsO patients with a high degree of accuracy, but accuracy for PsO-AC requires further investigation. Such methods allow researchers to conduct retrospective studies in databases in which diagnosis codes are absent.

Apixaban was shown to be safer than warfarin, with superior reduction in the risk of stroke, systemic embolism, mortality, and major bleeding irrespective of kidney function. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-utility of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at different levels of kidney function. Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of apixaban compared with warfarin in AF patients at three levels of kidney function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 80 ml/min, 50 to 80 ml/min, and 50 ml/min or less. Event rates and associated utilities were obtained from previous literature. The model adopted the US health care system perspective, with hospitalization costs extracted from the Healthcare and Utilization Project. Treatment costs were obtained from official price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of results. Results: Apixaban was a dominant treatment strategy compared with warfarin in AF patients with eGFR levels of 50 ml/min or less and 50 to 80 ml/min. In patients with an eGFR of more than 80 ml/min, apixaban was cost-effective compared with warfarin, costing $6307 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results were consistent assuming anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. Compared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, apixaban was the only cost-effective anticoagulant strategy relative to warfarin in both mild and moderate renal impairment settings. Conclusions: Apixaban is a favorably cost-effective alternative to warfarin in AF patients with normal kidney function and potentially cost-saving in those with renal impairment.","[Altawalbeh, Shoroq M.; Alshogran, Osama Y.] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Pharm, Fac Pharm, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan; [Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Ctr Res Hlth Care, Sect Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Jordan University of Science & Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Altawalbeh, SM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Pharm, Fac Pharm, POB 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan.",smaltawalbeh@just.edu.jo,,"Alshogran, Osama/0000-0002-2466-4763; Altawalbeh, Shoroq/0000-0001-8345-4048",Jordan University of Science and Technology [87/2017],Jordan University of Science and Technology,This project was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jordan University of Science and Technology (grant no. 87/2017).,,52,5,6,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2018,21.0,12.0,,,,,1365,1372,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.009,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HC2LE,30502779.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000451632700003,0

Several studies have noted that there are methodological challenges to conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. Objective: Our objective was to examine key methodological challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests, prioritize these challenges for future research, and identify how studies have attempted solutions to address these challenges. Methods: We identified challenges for economic evaluations of NGS tests using prior literature and expert judgment of the co-authors. We used a modified Delphi assessment to prioritize challenges, based on importance and probability of resolution. Using a structured literature review and article extraction we then assessed whether published economic evaluations had addressed these challenges. Results: We identified 11 challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. The experts identified three challenges as the top priorities for future research: complex model structure, timeframe, and type of analysis and comparators used. Of the 15 published studies included in our literature review, four studies described specific solutions relevant to five of the 11 identified challenges. Conclusions: Major methodological challenges to economic evaluations of NGS tests remain to be addressed. Our results can be used to guide future research and inform decision-makers on how to prioritize research on the economic assessment of NGS tests.","[Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med TRANSP, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Deverka, Patricia A.] Amer Inst Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Wordsworth, Sarah; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Med Sci Div, Oxford, England; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Canc Control BC, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Christensen, Kurt D.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; American Institutes for Research; University of Calgary; University of Oxford; University of British Columbia; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Phillips, KA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDept Clin Pharm, 3333 Calif St,Room 420,POB 0613, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kathryn.Phillips@ucsf.edu,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040",National Human Genome Research Institute [R01 HG007063],National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)),This study was funded by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (R01 HG007063) and consulting agreement with Illumina (no number).,,32,49,52,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1033,1042,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.017,0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224106.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444833500004,0

Despite oncologists' crucial role in guiding cancer care, current literature is sparse with respect to the oncologists' views on value. Here, we evaluated oncologists perceptions of the use and measurement of value in cancer care. Methods: We conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 31 US oncologists practicing nationwide in various environments. Oncologists discussed the definition, measurement, and implementation of value. Transcripts were analyzed using matrix and thematic analysis. Results: Oncologists' definitions of value varied greatly. Some described versions of the standard health economic definition of value, that is, cost relative to health outcomes. Many others did not include cost in their definition of value. Oncologists considered patient goals and quality of life as important components of value that they perceived were missing from current value measurement. Oncologists prioritized a patient-centric view of value over societal or other perspectives. Oncologists were inclined to consider the value of a treatment only if they perceived treatment would pose a financial burden to patients. Oncologists had differing opinions regarding who should be responsible for determining whether care is low value but generally felt this should remain within the purview of the oncology community. Conclusions: Oncologists agreed that cost was an important issue, but disagreed about whether cost was involved in value as well as the role of value in guiding treatment. Better clarity and alignment on the definition of and appropriate way to measure value is critical to the success of efforts to improve value in cancer care.","[Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Murrell, Samantha S.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Nevedal, Andrea L.; Timko, Christine; Asch, Steven M.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Innovat Implementat, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Asch, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Blayney, Douglas W.; Patel, Manali; Ramchandran, Kavitha] Stanford Univ, Div Med Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Patel, Manali] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Patel, Manali] Stanford Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Patel, Manali] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kelly, P.

However, it is unclear whether patient perspectives were solicited during development or validation of the included patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Objective: To examine the pedigree of a sample of measures included in the COA Compendium. Methods: PROs included in chapters 1 or 2 of the COA Compendium were extracted and three reviewers independently searched PubMed and Google to identify information on measure pedigree. Data on method and stage of measure development where patient engagement took place were documented. Results: Among the 26 evaluated PRO measures, we were unable to identify information on development or validation on nearly half the sample (n = 12). Among the remaining 14 measures, 5 did not include any evidence of patient engagement; 2 engaged patients during concept elicitation only; 1 engaged patients during psychometric validation only; and 6 engaged patients during both concept elicitation and cognitive interviewing. Measures either previously qualified or submitted for qualification were more likely to include patient engagement. Conclusions: For the FDA Pilot COA Compendium to fulfill its purpose of fostering PFDD, it needs fine-tuning to reflect today's standards, improving transparency and facilitating clear identification of included measures so that the level of patient engagement, among other factors, can be properly assessed. Suggested improvements include identifying clinical trials that correspond to the COA Compendium's use in drug development; more clearly identifying which measure is referred to; and including only those measures that already qualified or undergoing qualification.","[Oehrlein, Elisabeth M.; Perfetto, Eleanor M.; Love, T.

We provide evidence on this question from a randomized controlled trial of modest-sized incentives to attend the gym among new members of a fitness facility. Our experiment randomized 690 participants into a control group that received a $30 payment unconditionally or one of 3 incentive groups that received a payment for attending the gym at least 9 times over the first 6 weeks of membership. Two incentive treatment arms offered monetary payments of $30 and $60. The third incentive treatment, motivated by the endowment effect, offered a physical item worth $30. All three incentives had only small impacts on attendance during members' first 6 weeks and no effect on their post-incentive visit trajectories. We document substantial overconfidence among new members about their likely visits and discuss how overconfidence may undermine the effectiveness of incentive programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The need for the relevant analytical framework for assessing the economic value of such technologies has been recognized. Objectives: To present a modified difference-in-differences (DID) cost-effectiveness methodology that facilitates visualization of a new health technology's learning curve. Methods: Using the Premier Perspective database (Premier Inc., Charlotte, NC), we examined the impact of physicians adopting a bipolar sealer (BPS) to control blood loss in primary unilateral total knee arthroplasties on hospital lengths of stay and total hospitalization costs when compared with two control groups. In our DID approach, we substituted month-from-adoption for the calendar-month-of-adoption in both graphical representations and ordinary least-squares regression results to estimate the effect of the BPS. Results: The results clearly demonstrated a learning curve associated with the adoption of the BPS technology. Although the reductions in length of stay were immediate, the first postadoption year costs increased by $1335 (extrahospital controls) to $1565 (within-hospital controls). Importantly, and also consistent with a learning curve hypothesis, these initial higher costs were offset by subsequent cost savings in the second and third years postadoption. Conclusions: The presented modified DID approach is a suitable and versatile analytical tool for economic evaluation of a slowly diffusing medical device or health technology. It provides a better understanding of the potential learning effects associated with relevant interventions.","[Kuznietsova, Victoria] Medtron Aduanced Energy LLC, Portsmouth, NH USA; [Kuznietsova, Victoria; Woodward, Robert S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, 10 Garrison Ave, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Woodward, Robert S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Kuznietsova, V (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, 10 Garrison Ave, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",victoria.kuznietsova@gmail.com,,,"Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH","Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH","This study was funded by Medtronic Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH.

In most contexts, private supply chains will be key to effective and efficient preventative supplementation. With established vendors, we conducted a 60-week market trial for a food-based micronutrient supplement in rural Burkina Faso with randomized price and non-price treatments. Repeat purchases - critical for effective supplementation - are extremely price sensitive. Loyalty cards boost demand more than price discounts, particularly in non-poor households where the father is the cardholder. A small minority of households achieved sufficient supplementation for their children through purely retail distribution, suggesting the need for more creative public-private delivery platforms informed by insights into household demand persistence and heterogeneity.

Activating mutations can be identified via single-gene testing or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Objectives: To evaluate the budget impact of NGS instead of single-gene testing for tissue-based molecular assessment of aNSCLC from the US health care payer perspective. Methods: An annual cohort of newly diagnosed patients with nonsquamous aNSCLC in a hypothetical 1-million-member health care plan was evaluated using a Markov model over 5 years. Epidemiology and testing rates (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, HER2, and RET) were from the literature. Treatments were determined by available genetic information. Safety, progression, and survival with targeted therapy or chemotherapy were from randomized clinical trials. Single-gene testing and first-line and maintenance treatment costs were from RED BOOK and Medicare fee schedules; NGS testing, adverse event, and progression costs to payers were from the literature. Results: Three hundred sixteen testing-eligible patients with aNSCLC were expected annually, of whom 179 undergo genetic testing. Of 57 patients expected to have activating mutations, single-gene testing identified 35, whereas NGS identified 54. NGS, instead of single-gene testing, decreased expected testing procedure-related costs to the health plan payer by $24,651. First-line and maintenance treatment costs increased by $842,205, offset by a $385,000 decrease in second-line treatment and palliative care costs. Over 5 years, total budget impact was $432,554 ($0.0072 per member per month). Conclusions: NGS is expected to identify more patients with activating mutations, thereby better enabling selection for targeted therapy and clinical trial enrollment. The budget impact to US payers is expected to be minimally cost-additive.","[Yu, Tiffany M.; Tradonsky, Alison; Arnold, Renee J.

ISPOR's Economic Evaluation of Vaccines Designed to Prevent Infectious Disease: Good Practices Task Force wrote guidelines for three analytic methods and solicited comments on them from external reviewers. Cost-effectiveness analyses use decision-analytic models to estimate cumulative changes in resource use, costs, and changes in quality- or disability-adjusted life-years attributable to changes in disease outcomes. Constrained optimization modeling uses a mathematical objective function to be optimized (e.g. disease cases avoided) for a target population for a set of interventions including vaccination programs within established constraints. Fiscal health modeling estimates changes in net present value of government revenues and expenditures attributable to changes in disease outcomes. The task force recommends that those designing economic analyses for new vaccination programs take into account the decision maker's policy objectives and country-specific decision context when estimating: uptake rate in the target population; vaccination program's impact on disease cases in the population over time using a dynamic transmission epidemiologic model; vaccination program implementation and operating costs; and the changes in costs and health outcomes of the target disease(s). The three approaches to economic analysis are complementary and can be used alone or together to estimate a vaccination program's economic value for national, regional, or subregional decision makers in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Standaert, Baudouin] GSK Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium; [Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.] Global Market Access Solut LLC, Geneva, Switzerland; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Garrison, Louis P.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hutubessy, Raymond] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med & Publ Hlth, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Pitman, Richard] ICON, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Revill, Paul] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Severens, Johan L.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Groningen; University of York - UK; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; World Health Organization; ICON plc; University of York - UK; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Mauskopf, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåRTI Int, RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,"Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Revill, Paul/0000-0001-8632-0600; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",World Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),,,81,78,80,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21.0,10.0,,,,,1133,1149,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.08.005,0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314613.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446871600001,0

Methods: Case study that describes key methodological and data challenges that were encountered or are likely to emerge in future work, describes the pros and cons of approaches considered by the study team, and summarizes the solutions that were implemented. Results: Major methodological challenges included defining whole genome sequencing, structuring an appropriate comparator, measuring downstream costs, and examining clinical outcomes. Discussions about solutions addressed conceptual and practical issues that arose because of definitions and analyses around the cost of genomic sequencing in trial-based studies. Conclusions: The MedSeq Project provides an instructive example of how to conduct a cost analysis of whole genome sequencing that feasibly incorporates best practices while being sensitive to the varied applications and diversity of results it may produce. Findings provide guidance for researchers to consider when conducting or analyzing economic analyses of whole genome sequencing and other next-generation sequencing tests, particularly regarding costs.","[Christensen, Kurt D.; Green, Robert C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Christensen, Kurt D.; Green, Robert C.] Harvard Med Sch, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med TRANSP, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Green, Robert C.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Green, Robert C.] Partners HealthCare Personalized Med, Boston, MA USA; [Dukhovny, Dmitry] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Pediat, 3181 Sw Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute; Partners Healthcare System; Oregon Health & Science University,"Christensen, KD (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBrigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Christensen, KD (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Med Sch, EC Alumnae Bldg,Suite 301,41 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",kchristensen@bwh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [U01-HG006500, K01-HG009173, R01-HG007063]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants U01-HG006500, K01-HG009173, and R01-HG007063",,68,11,11,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1054,1061,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.06.013,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224109.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444833500007,0

We demonstrate that II procedures that simply discard sample units with missing observations can yield inconsistent estimates of the true structural parameters. By inverse probability weighting (1PW) the complete case observations, i.e., sample units with no missing variables for the observed and simulated samples, we propose a new method of 11 to consistently estimate the structural parameters of interest. Asymptotic properties of the new estimator are discussed. We consider a multinomial probit model to illustrate this approach and subsequently consider simulation studies in a variety of discrete choice models with and without dynamics in terms of lagged dependent variables and serially correlated errors. The simulation results demonstrate the severe bias incurred by existing II estimators, and its correction by our new II estimator. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we consider the more general setting where we allocate the goods to groups of agents. The agents in each group share the same set of goods even though they may have conflicting preferences. For two groups, we characterize the cardinality of the groups for which a positive approximation of the maximin share is possible regardless of the number of goods.

Although it may appear evident that occupation can affect health, there are multiple possible sources of selection that can generate a strong association, other than simply a causal effect of occupation on health. We link job characteristics to German panel data spanning 29years to characterize occupations by their physical and psychosocial burden. Employing a dynamic model to control for factors that simultaneously affect health and selection into occupation, we find that selection into occupation accounts for at least 60% of the association. The effects of occupational characteristics such as physical strain and low job control are negative and increase with age: late-career exposure to 1year of high physical strain and low job control is comparable to the average health decline from ageing 16 and 6months, respectively.","[Ravesteijn, Bastian; van Kippersluis, Hans; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ravesteijn, Bastian] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ravesteijn, Bastian] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES EA4470, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Kippersluis, Hans; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Universite Paris Cite; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Ravesteijn, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHarvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Ravesteijn, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Paris 05, LIRAES EA4470, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.",ravesteijn@hcp.med.harvard.edu,"Ravesteijn, Bastian/HSH-3231-2023","van Doorslaer, Eddy/0000-0003-2692-1433",Commonwealth Fund; Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking [115621]; European Union's Seventh Framework Program [FP7/2007-2013]; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01AG037398]; NWO [016.145.082],Commonwealth Fund; Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking; European Union's Seventh Framework Program(European Union (EU)); National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The Commonwealth Fund; the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking, Grant/Award Number: 115621; European Union's Seventh Framework Program, Grant/Award Number: FP7/2007-2013; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01AG037398; NWO, Grant/Award Number: 016.145.082",,40,33,36,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,E69,E86,,10.1002/hec.3563,0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28901590.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428523400006,0

We formally demonstrate that existing strategies for detecting selection based on such 'unused characteristics' can lead to incorrect conclusions if the estimated coefficients of interest are driven by different parts of the population. We show that this issue can empirically be accounted for by allowing for heterogeneous parameters. We compare existing approaches by using simulated data with different selection regimes and test for parameter heterogeneity within the data. We further provide empirical evidence about selection into the market for private health insurance in England. Both our simulations, and the findings using real data, suggest that parameter heterogeneity is a relevant issue that can confound the interpretation of standard 'unused characteristics' approaches. Our findings are important for analysing the efficiency of insurance markets. They are of interest to both the insurance industry and policymakers, and should be accounted for when selection based on specific characteristics needs to be detected or the effects of structural changes of insurance policies/markets are to be predicted.

The main axiom of our analysis is called mixture aversion, as it captures a dislike of probabilistic mixtures of lotteries. Our representation for mixture-averse preferences can be interpreted as if an individual optimally selects her risk attitude from some feasible set. We describe some useful parametric examples of our representation and provide comparative statics that tightly link decreases in risk aversion to larger sets of feasible risk attitudes. We then present several applications of the model. In an insurance problem, mixture-averse preferences can produce a marginal willingness to pay for insurance coverage that increases in the level of existing coverage. In investment decisions, our model can generate endogenous heterogeneity in equilibrium stock market participation, even when consumers have identical preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can address the Rabin paradox even in the presence of reasonable levels of background risk.","[Sarver, Todd] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Sarver, T (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDuke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",todd.sarver@duke.edu,,"Sarver, Todd/0000-0003-1526-1089",,,,,69,8,8,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2018,86.0,4.0,,,,,1347,1382,,10.3982/ECTA12687,0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GP1BX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000440548700007,0

We depart from the classical setting by allowing for (0) to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate (0), we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating (0) cause a heavy bias in estimators of (0) that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of (0) into estimating equations for (0). This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N-1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest (0) can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate (0); (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N-1/2-neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.","[Chernozhukov, Victor; Demirer, Mert; Duflo, Esther; Newey, Whitney] MIT, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chetverikov, Denis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hansen, Christian] Univ Chicago, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Robins, James] Harvard Univ, 677 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago; Harvard University,"Chernozhukov, V (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; chetverikov@econ.ucla.edu; mdemirer@mit.edu; duflo@mit.edu; chansen1@chicagobooth.edu; wnewey@mit.edu; robins@hsph.harvard.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to acknowledge research support from the National Science Foundation.

Maximum PCSK9i utilization of 1-5% over 3 years according to risk group (following the same pattern as current ezetimibe use), and 5-10% as a secondary scenario, were assumed. Total healthcare budget impacts per target patient (and per member) per month for years 1, 2 and 3 were $3.62($0.10), $7.22($0.20) and $10.79($0.30), respectively, assuming 1-5% maximum PCSK9i utilization, and $15.81($0.44), $31.52($0.88) and $47.12($1.31), respectively, assuming 5-10% utilization. Results were sensitive to changes in model timeframe, years to maximum PCSK9i utilization and PCSK9i costs. The budget impact of PCSK9i as add-on therapy to statins for patients with hypercholesterolemia is relatively low compared with published estimates for other specialty biologics. Drug cost rebates and discounts are likely to further reduce budget impact.","[Mallya, Usha G.; Koren, Andrew] Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA; [Boklage, Susan H.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, 777 Old Saw Mill River Rd, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Delea, Thomas E.] Policy Anal Inc, Brookline, MA USA; [Mullins, C.

The Kalman filter is used to construct the state-augmented likelihood function and subsequently to generate forecasts, which are mean and path-corrected. We apply our model to eight daily volatility series constructed from both high-frequency and daily returns. Full sample parameter estimates reveal that random level shifts are present in all series. Genuine long memory is present in most high-frequency measures of volatility, whereas there is little remaining dynamics in the volatility measures constructed using daily returns. From extensive forecast evaluations, we find that our ARFIMA model with random level shifts consistently belongs to the 10% Model Confidence Set across a variety of forecast horizons, asset classes and volatility measures. The gains in forecast accuracy can be very pronounced, especially at longer horizons.","[Varneskov, Rasmus T.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Aarhus University; Boston University,"Varneskov, RT (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",rvarneskov@creates.au.dk,,"Varneskov, Rasmus/0000-0002-6533-5608","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University; CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation [DRNF78]","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University; CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","We wish to thank Asger Lunde for providing cleaned high frequency tick data.

First, we demonstrate that microeconomic uncertainty rises sharply during recessions, including during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Second, we show that uncertainty shocks can generate drops in gross domestic product of around 2.5% in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms. However, we also find that uncertainty shocks need to be supplemented by first-moment shocks to fit consumption over the cycle. So our data and simulations suggest recessions are best modelled as being driven by shocks with a negative first moment and a positive second moment. Finally, we show that increased uncertainty can make first-moment policies, like wage subsidies, temporarily less effective because firms become more cautious in responding to price changes.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Floetotto, Max] McKinsey & Co Inc, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jaimovich, Nir] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Saporta-Eksten, Itay] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Terry, Stephen J.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Stanford University; University of Zurich; Tel Aviv University; University of London; University College London; Boston University,"Bloom, N (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; max.floetotto@alumni.stanford.edu; nir.jaimovich@uzh.ch; itaysap@post.tau.ac.il; stephent@bu.edu,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019","Terry, Stephen/0000-0002-7692-2074",,,,,79,408,474,19,224,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2018,86.0,3.0,,,,,1031,1065,,10.3982/ECTA10927,0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GI0XJ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-03-08,WOS:000434093400007,0

Examining a range of different types of returns and thresholds we find that recurrence intervals follow a q-exponential distribution, which we then use to theoretically derive the hazard probability http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink. Maximizing the usefulness of extreme forecasts to define an optimized hazard threshold, we indicate a financial extreme occurring within the next day when the hazard probability is greater than the optimized threshold. Both in-sample tests and out-of-sample predictions indicate that these forecasts are more accurate than a benchmark that ignores the predictive signals.

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a risk engine with multiple risk equations using a recent patient cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus reflective of the US population. Methods A total of 17 risk equations for predicting diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular events, hypoglycemia, mortality, and progression of diabetes risk factors were estimated using the data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (n = 10,251). Internal and external validation processes were used to assess performance of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) risk engine. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of risk factors on mortality at the population level. Results The BRAVO risk engine added several risk factors including severe hypoglycemia and common US racial/ethnicity categories compared with the UKPDS risk engine. The BRAVO risk engine also modeled mortality escalation associated with intensive glycemic control (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin < 6.5%). External validation showed a good prediction power on 28 endpoints observed from other clinical trials (slope = 1.071, R-2 = 0.86). Conclusion The BRAVO risk engine for the US diabetes cohort provides an alternative to the UKPDS risk engine. It can be applied to assist clinical and policy decision making such as cost-effective resource allocation in USA.","[Shao, Hui; Stoecker, Charles; Liu, Shuqian; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Fonseca, Vivian] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,40,55,55,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9.0,,,,,1125,1134,,10.1007/s40273-018-0662-1,0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29725871.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000439998500009,0

Network formation models present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show how one can use the observed proportions of various local network structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoff-relevant local structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension reduction.","[de Paula, Aureo] UCL, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth; Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Lehigh University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"de Paula, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUCL, London, England.;de Paula, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåSao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåIFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",apaula@ucl.ac.uk; sethrs@lehigh.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448","NSF [SES-1123990]; ERC [338187]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1, ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [338187] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees, along with seminar and conference participants at the Conference on Econometric Analysis of Social Interactions at Northwestern University (2010), the ASSA meetings in Chicago (2012), University of Western Ontario (2013), the Stats in Paris: Statistics and Econometrics of Networks (2013) conference, the Recent Advances in Set Identification (2013) conference, the 2nd European Meeting of Network Economics (2014), Heinz College (2015), the INET Econometrics of Networks Workshop at Cambridge University (2015), the Cowles Foundation (2015), Northwestern University (2015), the Chicago Fed (2015), the Econometric Society World Congress (2015), the USC Dornsife INET Conference on Networks (2015), the New York Fed (2016), the University of Pennsylvania (2016), Surrey (2016), Groningen (2016), the Tinbergen Institute (2016), Harvard (2016), Rutgers (2016), and Virginia (2016) for suggestions and comments.

In multi-frequency finance various phenomena have been observed, such as shocks, crashes, volatility clustering, turbulent flows and contagion. Hawkes processes have been proposed to model those challenging phenomena appearing across asset prices in various exchanges. The original Hawkes process is an intensity-based model for series of events with path dependence and self-exciting or mutual-exciting mechanisms. This paper introduces a slightly depressing process to model the reverse phenomenon of self-exciting mechanisms. Such a process models the decline in the intensity of jumps observed in market regimes. The proposed birth-immigration-death process captures the decline in jump intensity observed at the start of a daily trading regime while the classical immigration-birth process models an increase in jump intensity towards the close of daily trading. Each of these processes can be expressed as a special case of a simple bivariate Hawkes process.","[Khashanah, Khaldoun] Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Chen, Jing] Cardiff Univ, Math Inst, Senghennydd Rd, Cardiff CF24 4AG, S Glam, Wales; [Hawkes, Alan] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Bay Campus,Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales",Stevens Institute of Technology; Cardiff University; Swansea University,"Khashanah, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",kkhashan@stevens.edu,,"Hawkes, Alan/0000-0003-0990-1772",,,,,36,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We use a field experiment and a structural model to study how plant emission standards are enforced. In collaboration with an Indian environmental regulator, we experimentally doubled the rate of inspection for treatment plants and required that the extra inspections be assigned randomly. We find that treatment plants only slightly increased compliance. We hypothesize that this weak effect is due to poor targeting, since the random inspections in the treatment found fewer extreme violators than the regulator's own discretionary inspections. To unbundle the roles of extra inspections and the removal of discretion over what plants to target, we set out a model of environmental regulation where the regulator targets inspections, based on a signal of pollution, to maximize plant abatement. Using the experiment to identify key parameters of the model, we find that the regulator aggressively targets its discretionary inspections, to the degree that half of the plants receive fewer than one inspection per year, while plants expected to be the dirtiest may receive ten. Counterfactual simulations show that discretion in targeting helps enforcement: inspections that the regulator assigns cause three times more abatement than would the same number of randomly assigned inspections. Nonetheless, we find that the regulator's information on plant pollution is poor, and improvements in monitoring would reduce emissions.","[Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Greenstone, Michael] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pande, Rohini] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ryan, Nicholas] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago; Harvard University; Yale University,"Duflo, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",eduflo@mit.edu; mgreenst@uchicago.edu; rohini_pande@harvard.edu; nicholas.ryan@yale.edu,,,"Sustainability Science Program (SSP); Harvard Environmental Economics Program; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR); International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); National Science Foundation (NSF) [1066006]; International Growth Centre (IGC); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1066006] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Sustainability Science Program (SSP); Harvard Environmental Economics Program; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR); International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); International Growth Centre (IGC); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Sanjiv Tyagi, R.

GP regression is a nonparametric, data-driven approach for determining the spatial dependence in mortality rates and jointly smoothing raw rates across dimensions, such as calendar year and age. The GP model quantifies uncertainty associated with smoothed historical experience and generates full stochastic trajectories for out-of-sample forecasts. Our framework is well suited for updating projections when newly available data arrives, and for dealing with edge issues where credibility is lower. We present a detailed analysis of GP model performance for US mortality experience based on the CDC (Center for Disease Control) datasets. We investigate the interaction between mean and residual modeling, Bayesian and non-Bayesian GP methodologies, accuracy of in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting, and stability of model parameters. We also document the general decline, along with strong age-dependency, in mortality improvement factors over the past few years, contrasting our findings with the Society of Actuaries (SOA) MP-2014 and -2015 models that do not fully reflect these recent trends.","[Ludkovski, Mike] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Risk, Jimmy] Cal Poly Pomona, Dept Math Sci, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Zail, Howard] Elucidor LLC, New York, NY 10016 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona,"Risk, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCal Poly Pomona, Dept Math Sci, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",ludkovski@pstat.ucsb.edu; jrisk@cpp.edu; hzail@elucidor.com,,"Ludkovski, Michael/0000-0001-7887-3870",,,,,44,17,19,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2018,48.0,3.0,,,,,1307,1347,,10.1017/asb.2018.24,0,,,41,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GV7RN,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446328300014,0

Our main assumption is that the regression function is known to lie in a convex function class, which covers most smoothness and/or shape assumptions used in econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic results when the error distribution is not known. When the function class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are substantively tighter using data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage over the whole function class.

Policy relevance and external validity turn on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the treatment parameter of interest from the IV estimand and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain.","[Mogstad, Magne] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Torgovitsky, Alexander] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago,"Mogstad, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Mogstad, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com; andres@econ.ucla.edu; torgovitsky@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1530538, SES-1426882]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, four anonymous referees, Matt Masten, Derek Neal, Ed Vytacil, Chris Walters, and seminar participants at several universities and conferences for valuable feedback and suggestions.

Perspective UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Results In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below 10,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was 4927 pound per QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in the biologic-naive population. Conclusions Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with active AS. Further research on long-term radiographic progression outcomes would be valuable for future cost-effectiveness analyses in AS.","[Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Rheumat & Musculoskeletal Med, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Leeds Teaching Hosp NHS Trust, NIHR Leeds Biomed Res Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Van Keep, Marjolijn] BresMed Netherlands BV, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Beard, Steve] BresMed, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Chris; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Jugl, Steffen Marc] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, India; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Leeds Biomedical Research Centre; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis,"Halliday, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNovartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.co,"emery, paul/B-3560-2013","Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,23,14,15,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2018,36.0,8.0,,,,,1015,1027,,10.1007/s40273-018-0675-9,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GK9SK,29797186.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436593900012,0

Rifaximin is a non-systemic antibiotic that reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and overt HE-related hospitalizations. Objective Our objective was to provide an overview of the direct HE-related costs and cost benefits of rifaximin, lactulose, and rifaximin plus lactulose. Methods A systematic review of PubMed and relevant meeting abstracts was conducted to identify publications since 1 January 2007 reporting economic data related to HE and rifaximin and/or lactulose. Further, a public database and published literature were used to estimate current costs of hospitalization for overt HE, and potential cost savings of HE-related hospitalizations with rifaximin. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Drummond checklist. Results A total of 16 reports were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. Globally, HE-related direct costs ranged from $US5370 to $US50,120 annually per patient. Rifaximin was associated with shorter hospital stays and reduced healthcare costs. Rifaximin also has the potential to reduce overt HE-related hospitalization risk by 50% compared with lactulose. Rifaximin was shown to have a favourable pharmacoeconomic profile compared with lactulose (based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). Conclusions In addition to its clinical benefits (e.g. reduction in the risk of recurrence of overt HE, overt HE-related hospitalizations, favourable adverse event profile), economic data are favourable for the use of rifaximin in patients with a history of overt HE.","[Neff, Guy] Florida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA; [Zachry, Woodie, III] Quantym Therapeut Data, Sarasota, FL USA",,"Neff, G (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåFlorida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA.",guy.neff@fdhs.com,,,"Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Technical editorial assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Mary Beth Moncrief, PhD, and Sophie Bolick, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA, USA.

This result implies that, under these assumptions, any test with nontrivial power will exhibit size distortions.

Despite the apparent importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in modern empirical work is to largely ignore it by reporting average partial effects (or, at best, average effects for some groups). While average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects-a collection of estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by percentiles. By construction, the sorted effect curves completely represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap. We find that this gap is particularly strong for married women, ranging from -60% to 0% between the 2% and 98% percentiles, as a function of observed and unobserved characteristics; while the gap for never married women ranges from -40% to +20%. The most adversely affected women tend to be married, do not have college degrees, work in sales, and have high levels of potential experience.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fernandez-Val, Ivan] BU, Dept Econ, Boston, MA USA; [Luo, Ye] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Hong Kong,"Chernozhukov, V (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; ivanf@bu.edu; kurtluo@hku.hk,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the coeditor, three anonymous referees, Alberto Abadie, Daron Acemoglu, Isaiah Andrews, Joshua Angrist, Debopam Bhattacharya, Jaroslav Borovicka, Kasey Buckles, Denis Chetverikov, Jerry Hausman, Tetsuya Kaji, Pat Kline, Roger Koenker, Siyi Luo, Maddie McKelway, Anna Mikusheva, Whitney Newey, Claudia Olivetti, Andres Santos, Camille Terrier, Frank Windmeijer, Abigail Wozniak, and seminar participants at multiple institutions for helpful discussions.

Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet) was ruled by a strong, centralized state in which the village was the fundamental administrative unit. Southern Vietnam was a peripheral tributary of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire, which followed a patron-client model with more informal, personalized power relations and no village intermediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, the study shows that areas exposed to Dai Viet administrative institutions for a longer period prior to French colonization have experienced better economic outcomes over the past 150 years. Rich historical data document that in Dai Viet villages, citizens have been better able to organize for public goods and redistribution through civil society and local government.

In a structural version of this model where the driver variables of the STUR coefficient are endogenous, the NLLS estimate of the STUR parameter is inconsistent, as are the corresponding estimates of the associated covariance parameters. This paper develops a nonlinear instrumental variable (NLIV) as well as GMM estimators of the STUR parameter which conveniently addresses endogeneity. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators and establish consistency under similar orthogonality and relevance conditions to those used in the linear model. An overidentification test and its asymptotic distribution are also developed. The results enable inference about structural STUR models and a mechanism for testing the local STUR model against a simple UR null, which complements usual UR tests. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators of the STUR parameter as well as the test for overidentifying restrictions perform well in small samples and that the distribution of the NLIV estimator is heavily leptokurtic with a limit theory which has Cauchy- like tails. Comparisons of STUR coefficient and standard UR coefficient tests show that the one-sided UR test performs poorly against the one-sided STUR coefficient test both as the sample size and departures from the null rise. The results are applied to study the relationships between stock returns and bond spread changes.","[Lieberman, Offer] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Phillips, Peter C.

The approach involves first transforming the time series using orthonormal basis functions in L-2[0, 1], which have energy concentrated at low frequencies, and then running an augmented regression based on the transformed data and constructing the test statistics in the usual way. The approach is essentially the same as the trend instrumental variable approach of Phillips (2014), but the number of orthonormal basis functions is held fixed for the development of the standard F and t asymptotic theory. The tests are extremely simple to implement, as they can be carried out in exactly the same way as if the transformed regression is a classical linear normal regression. In particular, critical values are from the standard F or t distribution. The proposed F and t tests are robust in that they are asymptotically valid regardless of whether the number of basis functions is held fixed or allowed to grow with the sample size. The F and t tests have more accurate size in finite samples than existing tests such as the asymptotic chi-squared and normal tests based on the fully modified OLS estimator of Phillips and Hansen (1990) and can be made as powerful as the latter test.","[Hwang, Jungbin] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA; [Sun, Yixiao] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Connecticut; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sun, YX (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",yisun@ucsd.edu,,,NSF [SES-1530592],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Michael Jansson and two anonymous referees for constructive comments.

This paper studies identification of average treatment response (ATR) and average treatment effect (ATE) from RT data under various assumptions. The focus is the problem of external validity of the RT. RT data need not point identify the ATR or ATE because of selective participation in the RT. The paper reports partial-identification and point-identification results for the ATR and ATE based on RT data under a variety of assumptions. The results include assumptions sufficient to point identify the ATR or ATE from RT data. Under weaker assumptions, the ATR or ATE is partially identified. Further, attention is given to identification of the sign of the ATE and identification of whether participation in the RT is selective. Finally, identification from RT data is compared to identification from observational data.","[Kline, Brendan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, BRB 2-144,2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 125,1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Harvard University,"Kline, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas Austin, Dept Econ, BRB 2-144,2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",brendan.kline@austin.utexas.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,"Kline, Brendan/JVD-9448-2023","Kline, Brendan/0009-0004-8484-0302",NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This article is based on an earlier paper distributed in January 2011 titled 'Using observational vs randomized controlled trial data to learn about treatment effects'.

After the development of some general results, we determine the nim-numbers of these games for abelian and dihedral groups. We also present some conjectures based on computer calculations. Our main computational and theoretical tool is the structure diagram of a game, which is a type of identification digraph of the game digraph that is compatible with the nim-numbers of the positions.

We work under a complex realistic environment: The surplus process is described by a jump-diffusion model and the financial market contains a market index, a risk-free asset, and a pair of mispriced stocks, where the expected return rate of the stocks and the mispricing follow mean reverting stochastic processes which take into account liquidity constraints. The insurer is allowed to purchase reinsurance and to invest in the financial market. We formulate an optimal robust reinsurance-investment problem under the assumption that the insurer is ambiguity-averse to the uncertainty from the financial market and to the uncertainty of the insured's claims. Ambiguity aversion is an aversion to the uncertainty taken by making investment decisions based on a misspecified model. By employing the dynamic programming approach, we derive explicit formulae for the optimal robust reinsurance-investment strategy and the optimal value function. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of some parameters on the optimal strategy and on utility loss functions. Among our various practical findings and recommendations, we find that strengthened market liquidity significantly increases the demand for hedging from the mispriced market, to take advantage of the statistical arbitrage it affords.

Competition among venues increases investor participation, trading volume, and allocative efficiency, but entry and fragmentation can be excessive, and speeds are generically inefficient.

I introduce a uniformly (in the data-generating process) consistent estimator under nearly minimal identifying assumptions. The proposed estimator, called the integrated instrumental variables (IIV) estimator, is a simple weighted least-squares estimator. It does not require the choice of a bandwidth or tuning parameter, or the selection of a finite set of instruments. Thus, the estimator is extremely simple to implement. Monte Carlo evidence supports the theoretical claims and suggests that the IIV estimator is a robust complement to optimal instrumental variables in finite samples. In an application with quarterly UK data, the IIV estimator estimates a positive and significant elasticity of intertemporal substitution and an equally sensible estimate for its reciprocal, in sharp contrast to instrumental variables methods that fail to identify these parameters.","[Escanciano, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 105 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Escanciano, JC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåIndiana Univ, Dept Econ, 105 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jescanci@indiana.edu,"Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",,,,,45,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Our model is based on the single-period version of the linear-normal framework of Kyle (1985). We allow for essentially arbitrary correlations among the random variables involved in the model: the value of the traded asset, the signals of strategic traders and competitive market makers, and the demand from liquidity traders. We show that there always exists a unique linear equilibrium, characterize it analytically, and illustrate its properties with a number of applications. We then use this characterization to study the informational efficiency of prices as the number of strategic traders becomes large. If liquidity demand is positively correlated (or uncorrelated) with the asset value, then prices in large markets aggregate all available information. If liquidity demand is negatively correlated with the asset value, then prices in large markets aggregate all information except that contained in liquidity demand.","[Lambert, Nicolas S.; Ostrovsky, Michael] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ostrovsky, Michael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Panov, Mikhail] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Lambert, NS (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nlambert@stanford.edu; ostrovsky@stanford.edu; panov@nyu.edu,"Ostrovsky, Michael/A-1134-2007; Panov, Mikhail/AAP-3800-2020","Panov, Mikhail/0000-0001-5832-8277; Ostrovsky, Michael/0000-0002-4670-3348",National Science Foundation [CCF-1101209]; Microsoft Research; Cowles Foundation at YaleUniversity; Alfred P.

The new CLTs are used to develop a test of the restrictive separability' condition that is necessary for second-stage regressions of efficiency estimates on environmental variables. We show that if this condition is violated, not only are second-stage regressions difficult to interpret and perhaps meaningless, but also first-stage, unconditional efficiency estimates are misleading. As such, the test developed here is of fundamental importance to applied researchers using non-parametric methods for efficiency estimation. The test is shown to be consistent and its local power is examined. Our simulation results indicate that our tests perform well both in terms of size and power. We provide a real-world empirical example by re-examining the paper by Aly etal.

Ironically, the fact that the estimators are complicated can make the standard bootstrap computationally burdensome because it requires repeated recalculation of the estimator. In this paper, we propose a method that is specific to extremum estimators based on U-statistics. The contribution here is that rather than repeated recalculation of the U-statistic-based estimator, we can recalculate a related estimator based on single sums. A simulation study suggests that the approach leads to a good approximation to the standard bootstrap and that if this is the goal, then our approach is superior to numerical derivative methods.","[Honore, Bo E.] Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hu, Luojia] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Econ Res Dept, 230 S La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Honor√©, BE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",honore@princeton.edu; lhu@frbchi.org,,,National Science Foundation; Gregory C.

We use the proposed modeling framework to analyze the effects of trading frequency on market liquidity in a very general setting. In particular, we demonstrate the dual effect of high trading frequency. On the one hand, the higher frequency increases market efficiency, if the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium. On the other hand, it also makes markets more fragile, in the sense that the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium only if they are market neutral (i.e., their beliefs satisfy certain martingale property). Even a very small deviation from market neutrality may cause the agents to stop providing liquidity, if the trading frequency is sufficiently high, which represents an endogenous liquidity crisis (also known as flash crash) in the market. This framework enables us to provide more insight into how such a liquidity crisis unfolds, connecting it to the so-called adverse selection effect.","[Gayduk, Roman; Nadtochiy, Sergey] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Nadtochiy, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sergeyn@umich.edu,,,NSF [DMS-1411824],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Partial support from the NSF Grant DMS-1411824 is acknowledged by both authors.

This paper develops a theory in which the network structure of productionwho buys inputs from whomforms endogenously. Entrepreneurs produce using labor and exactly one intermediate input; the key decision is which other entrepreneur's good to use as an input. Their choices collectively determine the economy's equilibrium input-output structure, generating large differences in size and shaping both individual and aggregate productivity. When the elasticity of output to intermediate inputs in production is high, star suppliers emerge endogenously. This raises aggregate productivity as, in equilibrium, more supply chains are routed through higher-productivity techniques.","[Oberfield, Ezra] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Oberfield, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPrinceton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",edo@princeton.edu,,,,,,,60,58,69,9,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2018,86.0,2.0,,,,,559,589,,10.3982/ECTA10731,0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GB1YM,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428847600005,0

In essence, all that is required is that the error process driving the random walk possesses a continuous spectral density that is strictly positive. Furthermore, under the same weak assumptions, the limiting distribution of the ADF test is derived under the alternative of stationarity, and a theoretical explanation is given for the well-known empirical fact that the test's power is a decreasing function of the chosen autoregressive order p. The intuitive reason for the reduced power of the ADF test is that, as p tends to infinity, the p regressors become asymptotically collinear.","[Paparoditis, Efstathios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Politis, Dimitris N.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Cyprus; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Paparoditis, E (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",stathisp@ucy.ac.cy,,"Paparoditis, Efstathios/0000-0003-1958-781X","NSF [DMS 12-23137, DMS 13-08319]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1223137] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),The research of the second author was partially supported by NSF grants DMS 12-23137 and DMS 13-08319.,,31,33,36,3,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

A widely used estimator is the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the L-1,L-1 matrix norm on the precision matrix Omega. The L-1,L-1 norm is a LASSO penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in Omega. We propose a new estimator called structured GLASSO (SGLASSO) that uses the L-1,L-2 mixed norm. The use of the L-1,L-2 penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in Omega. We show that when the network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic firms' investment data set, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric and US Steel forming the core group of firms.","[Chiong, Khai Xiang] Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Univ Pk Campus, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southern California; Yonsei University,"Chiong, KX (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",khai.chiong@utdallas.edu; moonr@usc.edu,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01023679],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We thank Victor Chernozhukov and two referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Pricing in these markets leads to incomplete tax pass-through and agents re optimize their purchase and pricing decisions in response to any tax change. We use detailed data from Pennsylvania, a state that monopolizes retail sales of alcoholic beverages, to estimate a model of demand for horizontally differentiated products that ties consumers' demographic characteristics to heterogeneous preferences for spirits. We find that under the state's current tax policy, spirits are overpriced. Distillers respond to decreases in the tax rate by increasing wholesale prices, which limits the state's revenue gain to only 13% of the incremental tax revenue predicted under the common assumption of perfect competition. The strategic response of noncompetitive firms to changes in taxation therefore flattens the Laffer curve significantly.","[Miravete, Eugenio J.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Competit Policy, Dept Econ, UEA, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Miravete, Eugenio J.] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Seim, Katja] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, CEPR, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Seim, Katja] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Thurk, Jeff] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Pennsylvania; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Notre Dame,"Miravete, EJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas Austin, Ctr Competit Policy, Dept Econ, UEA, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Miravete, EJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",miravete@eco.utexas.edu; kseim@wharton.upenn.edu; jthurk@nd.edu,"Thurk, Jeff/AAB-6009-2021; Thurk, Jeff/AAB-6530-2022","Thurk, Jeff/0000-0002-7626-7524",,,,,46,37,43,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2018,86.0,5.0,,,,,1651,1687,,10.3982/ECTA12307,0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HB2AT,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000450837000005,0

First, the meaning of a CE threshold and the key assumptions involved (perfect divisibility, marginal increments in budget, etc.) are highlighted using a hypothetical example, and the use of historic/heuristic estimates of the threshold is noted along with their limitations. Recent endeavours to estimate the empirical value of the thresholds, both from the supply side and the demand side, are then presented. The impact on CE thresholds of future directions for the field, such as thresholds across sectors and the incorporation of multiple criteria beyond quality-adjusted life-years as a measure of 'value', are highlighted. Finally, a number of common issues and misconceptions associated with CE thresholds are addressed.","[Thokala, Praveen; Tong, Thaison] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Ochalek, Jessica] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Leech, Ashley A.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth CEVR, Boston, MA 02111 USA",University of Sheffield; University of York - UK; Tufts Medical Center,"Thokala, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.thokala@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Tong, Thaison/0000-0002-9307-6850; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",,,,,79,113,115,1,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5.0,,,,,509,522,,10.1007/s40273-017-0606-1,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29427072.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430399300001,0

However, budget impact analyses remain less frequently conducted and less well researched than cost-effectiveness analyses. The objective of this study was to fill the gap in research on budget impact analyses by assessing (1) the quality of stand-alone budget impact analyses, and (2) the feasibility of extending cost-effectiveness analyses to capture budget impact. We developed a budget impact analysis checklist and scoring system for budget impact analyses, which we then adapted for cost-effectiveness analyses, based on current International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force recommendations. We applied both budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis checklists and scoring systems to examine the extent to which existing economic evaluations provide sufficient evidence about budget impact to enable decision making. We used rotavirus vaccination as an illustrative case in which low- and middle-income countries uptake has been limited despite demonstrated cost effectiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine in low- and middle-income countries published between January 2000 and February 2017. We critically appraised the quality of budget impact analyses, and assessed the extension of cost-effectiveness analyses to provide useful budget impact information. Six budget impact analyses and 60 cost-effectiveness analyses were identified. Budget impact analyses adhered to most International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research recommendations, with key exceptions being provision of undiscounted financial streams for each budget period and model validation. Most cost-effectiveness analyses could not be extended to provide useful budget impact information; cost-effectiveness analyses also rarely presented undiscounted annual costs, or estimated financial streams during the first years of programme scale-up. Cost-effectiveness analyses vastly outnumber budget impact analyses of rotavirus vaccination, despite both being critical for policy decision making. Straightforward changes to the presentation of cost-effectiveness analyses results could facilitate their adaptation into budget impact analyses.","[Carvalho, Natalie] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Dis Grp, Ctr Hlth Policy & Global Burden, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, London, England; [Cox, Sarah] WHO, Program Appl Vaccine Experiences Scholar, Initiat Vaccine Res, Geneva, Switzerland; [Yoong, Joanne] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Hosp Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Hutubessy, Raymond C.

We develop a micro-foundation for these off-path beliefs, and an associated equilibrium refinement, in a model where equilibrium arises through non-equilibrium learning by populations of patient and long-lived senders and receivers. In our model, young senders are uncertain about the prevailing distribution of play, so they rationally send out-of-equilibrium signals as experiments to learn about the behavior of the population of receivers. Differences in the payoff functions of the types of senders generate different incentives for these experiments. Using the Gittins index (Gittins (1979)), we characterize which sender types use each signal more often, leading to a constraint on the receiver's off-path beliefs based on type compatibility and hence a learning-based equilibrium selection.","[Fudenberg, Drew] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [He, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Fudenberg, D (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",drew.fudenberg@gmail.com; hesichao@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1643517],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material was previously part of a larger paper titled Type-Compatible Equilibria in Signalling Games.

We find evidence consistent with strategic behavior in Cambridge. Such strategizing can complicate preference analysis. This paper develops empirical methods for studying random utility models in a new and large class of school choice mechanisms. We show that preferences are nonparametrically identified under either sufficient variation in choice environments or a preference shifter. We then develop a tractable estimation procedure and apply it to Cambridge. Estimates suggest that while 83% of students are assigned to their stated first choice, only 72% are assigned to their true first choice because students avoid ranking competitive schools. Assuming that students behave optimally, the Immediate Acceptance mechanism is preferred by the average student to the Deferred Acceptance mechanism by an equivalent of 0.08 miles.

However, the statistical properties of the (quasi-)maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the EGARCH(p, q) parameters are not available under general conditions, but only for special cases under highly restrictive and unverifiable sufficient conditions, such as EGARCH(1,0) or EGARCH(1,1), and possibly only under simulation. A limitation in the development of asymptotic properties of the QMLE for the EGARCH(p, q) model is the lack of an invertibility condition for the returns shocks underlying the model. It is shown in this article that the EGARCH(p, q) model can be derived from a stochastic process, for which sufficient invertibility conditions can be stated simply and explicitly when the parameters respect a simple condition.(1)(1)Using the notation introduced in part 2, this refers to the cases where or -. The first inequality is generally assumed in the literature related to the invertibility of EGARCH. This article provides (in the Appendix) an argument for the possible lack of invertibility when these conditions are not met.

In dynamic contracting and policy settings, the method often replaces an endogenous state space of forward-looking utilities with an exogenously given state space of costates.

Information diffusion through prices is not affected by dealers' strategic trading motives, and there is an informational externality that constrains the informativeness of prices.

The study took the perspective and setting of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and two or more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was A 28,748 pound per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept, and had an ICER of A 5680 pound per QALY gained versus adalimumab and > A 1 pound million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between A 20,000 pound and A 30,000 pound, the probability of secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs).

This paper develops a life-cycle portfolio-choice model in which the investor experiences loss-averse utility over news and can ignore his portfolio. In such a model, the investor prefers to ignore and not rebalance his portfolio most of the time because he dislikes bad news more than he likes good news such that expected news causes a first-order decrease in utility. Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf. Moreover, the investor can diversify over time and his consumption aligns with predictions of mental accounting. I structurally estimate the preference parameters by matching stock shares and stock-market non-participation over the life cycle. My parameter estimates are in line with the literature, generate reasonable intervals of inattention, and simultaneously explain consumption and wealth accumulation over the life cycle. Here, it matters that news utility preserves first-order risk aversion even in the presence of stochastic labor income, which also causes stock shares to rise in wealth.","[Pagel, Michaela] Columbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Pagel, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåColumbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Pagel, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Pagel, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",mpagel@columbia.edu,,,Psych-and-Econ group at UC Berkeley,Psych-and-Econ group at UC Berkeley,"I thank Adam Szeidl, Matthew Rabin, Nick Barberis, Ulrike Malmendier, Botond Koszegi, Gur Huberman, Tano Santos, Paul Tetlock, Brett Green, Martin Lettau, John Beshears, James Choi, Keith Chen, Max Kasy, Florian Peters, Aniko Oery, Sheng Li, Ana Rocca, Marco Schwarz, Lydia Ashton, Sebastian Ebert, Takeshi Murooka, Victoria Vanasco as well as seminar participants at Wharton, LBS, Columbia GSB, Yale SOM, University of Toronto, Michigan State University, University of Toronto Rotman, UCLA Anderson, USC Marshall, University of Washington Foster, Federal Reserve Board, and other places for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In this study of emergency department physicians in shift work, schedules induce two distortions: First, physicians slack off by accepting fewer patients near end of shift (EOS). Second, physicians distort patient care, incurring higher costs as they spend less time on patients assigned near EOS. Examining how these effects change with shift overlap reveals a tradeoff between the two. Within an hour after the normal time of work completion, physicians are willing to spend hospital resources more than six times their market wage to preserve their leisure. Accounting for overall costs, I find that physicians slack off at approximately second-best optimal levels.","[Chan, David C.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Chan, DC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",david.c.chan@stanford.edu,,,"NBER Health and Aging Fellowship, under the National Institute of Aging [T32-AG000186]; Charles A.

In the current paper, we explore (1) the relationship between the symmetry assumption of Klibanoff et al. (KMS) (Econometrica 82:1945-1978, 2014) and alternative symmetry assumptions in the literature, and (2) assuming symmetry, the relationship between the set of relevant measures, shown by KMS (2014) to reflect only perceived ambiguity, and the set of measures (which we will refer to as the Bewley set) developed by Ghirardato et al. (J Econ Theory 118:133-173, 2004), Nehring (Ambiguity in the context of probabilistic beliefs, working paper, 2001, Bernoulli without Bayes: a theory of utility-sophisticated preference, working paper, 2007) and Ghirardato and Siniscalchi (A more robust definition of multiple priors, working paper, 2007, Econometrica 80:2827-2847, 2012). This Bewley set is the main alternative offered in the literature as possibly representing perceived ambiguity. Regarding symmetry assumptions, we show that, under relatively mild conditions, a variety of preference symmetry conditions from the literature [including that in KMS (2014)] are equivalent. In KMS (2014), we showed that, under symmetry, the Bewley set and the set of relevant measures are not always the same. Here, we establish a preference condition, No Half Measures, that is necessary and sufficient for the two to be the same under symmetry. This condition is rather stringent. Only when it is satisfied may the Bewley set be interpreted as reflecting only perceived ambiguity and not also taste aspects such as ambiguity aversion.","[Klibanoff, Peter] Northwestern Univ, Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Mukerji, Sujoy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Seo, Kyoungwon] Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Northwestern University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Seoul National University (SNU),"Mukerji, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåQueen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.",peterk@kellogg.northwestern.edu; s.mukerji@qmul.ac.uk; seo8240@snu.ac.kr,"Seo, Kyoungwon/K-8214-2012","Klibanoff, Peter/0000-0001-6948-5649",National Science Foundation [SES-0918248]; KAIST,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); KAIST,We thank the referees and the Editor for helpful comments.

Our main goal is to link performance and the stochastic process of the traded asset. Our study reports short-, medium- and long-term effects by looking at the Sharpe ratio (SR). We calculate the Sharpe ratio of our trading rule as a function of the probability distribution function of the underlying traded asset and compare it with data. We show that if the performance is mainly due to presence of autocorrelation in the returns of the traded assets, the SR as a function of the portfolio formation period (look-back) is very different from performance due to the drift (average return). The SR shows that for look-back periods of a few months the investor is more likely to tap into autocorrelation. However, for look-back larger than few months, the drift of the asset becomes progressively more important. Finally, our empirical work reports a new long-term effect, namely oscillation of the SR and proposes a non-stationary model to account for such oscillations.","[Ferreira, Fernando F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Silva, A.

The optimal exercise boundary for the volatility is obtained as the unique solution to an integral equation of Volterra type. We also consider a model mixing these two classes and formulate the corresponding optimal stopping problem in terms of the observed factor process. The price of an American VIX call is then represented by an early exercise premium formula.

That is, in the tBRD, an agent is more likely to revise his action when his current payoff is further from the optimal payoff, and he always switches to an optimal action when revising. The tBRD is a payoff monotone selection like the replicator dynamic, which makes medium and long-run outcomes more consistent with predictions from equilibrium refinement than the BRD in some situations. The technical contribution of the tBRD is continuous sensitivity, which allows us to apply results of a system of piecewise differential equations in order to obtain conditions for uniqueness and stability of solutions.","[Zusai, Dai] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,RA 873 004-04, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Zusai, D (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTemple Univ, Dept Econ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,RA 873 004-04, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",zusai@temple.edu,,,Richard E.

We show that the estimated asymptotic standard errors for spatial autoregressive parameters can be substantially smaller than their empirical counterparts. Hence, we extend the finite sample variance correction methodology of Windmeijer (2005) to the OGMME for the SARAR(1, 1) model. Results from simulation studies indicate that the correction method improves the variance estimates in small samples and leads to more accurate inference for the spatial autoregressive parameters. For the same model, we compare the finite sample properties of various test statistics for linear restrictions on autoregressive parameters. These tests include the standard asymptotic Wald test based on various GMMEs, a bootstrapped version of the Wald test, two versions of the C() test, the standard Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, the minimum chi-square test (MC), and two versions of the generalized method of moments (GMM) criterion test. Finally, we study the finite sample properties of effects estimators that show how changes in explanatory variables impact the dependent variable.","[Taspinar, Suleyman] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ Program, New York, NY 11367 USA; [Dogan, Osman] Istanbul Ulasim AS, Project Dept, Istanbul, Turkey; [Vijverberg, Wim P.

Literature reviews of the modeling methods and results from these CEAs have also been published. The last literature review that focused on modeling methods, without country or time horizon in the inclusion criteria, included studies published up to 2012. Since then, new DMTs have become available, and new models and data sources have been used to assess their cost effectiveness.ObjectiveThe aim of this systematic review was to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the relevant aspects of economic models used in CEAs of DMTs for RRMS, to understand how these models have progressed from recommendations provided in past reviews, what new approaches have been developed, what issues remain, and how they could be addressed.MethodsEMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the National Health System (NHS) Economic Evaluations Database, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, and EconLit were searched for cost-effectiveness studies of DMTs for RRMS that used decision-analytic models, published in English between 1 January 2012 and 24 December 2017. The inclusion criteria were as follows: being a full economic evaluation, a decision-analytic model was used, the target population concerned adult patients with RRMS, and being available in full-text format. Studies were not excluded based on the methodological quality. The background information of the included studies, as well as specific information on the components of the economic models related to the areas of recommendation from previous reviews were extracted.ResultsTwenty-three studies from ten countries were included. The model structure of these studies has converged over time, characterizing the course of disease progression in terms of changes in disability and the occurrence of relapses over time. Variations were found in model approach; data sources for the natural course of the disease and comparative efficacy between DMTs; number of lines of treatment modeled; long-term efficacy waning and treatment discontinuation assumptions; type of withdrawal; and criteria for selecting adverse events. Main areas for improvement include using long-term time horizons and societal perspective; reporting relevant health outcomes; conducting scenario analyses using different sources of natural history and utility values; and reporting how the model was validated.ConclusionThe structure of economic models used in CEAs of DMTs for RRMS has converged over time. However, variation remains in terms of model approach, inputs, and assumptions. Though some recommendations from previous reviews have been incorporated in later models, areas for improvement remain.","[Hernandez, Luis; O'Donnell, Malinda] Evidera, 500 Totten Pond Rd,Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Hernandez, Luis; Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, UMCG, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, GRIP, Unit Pharmacotherapy Epidemiol & Econ, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands",Evidera; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Hernandez, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEvidera, 500 Totten Pond Rd,Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.;Hernandez, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Groningen, UMCG, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.",luis.hernandez@evidera.com,"Hernandez, Luis/AAH-1819-2021","Hernandez, Luis/0000-0002-9532-546X; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,118,13,13,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10.0,,,,,1223,1252,,10.1007/s40273-018-0683-9,0,,,30,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29971666.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444007800006,0

Pharmaceutical manufacturers recently released transparency reports disclosing net price increases after accounting for rebates and other discounts. Objective Our objective was to determine whether manufacturer net prices (MNPs) could approximate the discounted prices observed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Methods We compared the annual, average price discounts voluntarily reported by three pharmaceutical manufacturers with the VA price for specific products from each company. The top 10 drugs by total sales reported from company tax filings for 2016 were included. The discount observed by the VA was determined from each drug's list price, reported as WAC, in 2016. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the VA discount observed and a weighted price index was calculated using the lowest price to the VA (Weighted VA Index), which was compared with the manufacturer index. Results The discounted price as a percentage of the WAC ranged from 9 to 74%. All three indexes estimated by the average discount to the VA were at or below the manufacturer indexes (42 vs. 50% for Eli Lilly, 56 vs. 65% for Johnson & Johnson, and 59 vs. 59% for Merck). Conclusions Manufacturer-reported average net prices may provide a close approximation of the average discounted price granted to the VA, suggesting they may be a useful proxy for the true pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) or payer cost. However, individual discounts for products have wide variation, making a standard discount adjustment across multiple products less acceptable.","[Mattingly, T.

(2015a). We introduce the state-dependent termination time to the model, and provide rationale for its introduction in insurance contexts. By examining some related potential measures, we first derive an explicit expression for the expected terminal utility of the entity in the DBRS model with Brownian motion dynamics. The analysis is later generalized to time-homogeneous Markov framework, where the spectrally negative Levy model is also discussed as a special example. Our results show that, even considering the impact of the termination risk, the DBRS strategy can still outperform its counterparts in either single regime strategy. This study shows that the DBRS model is not myopic, as it not only helps to recover from significant losses, but also may improve the insurer's overall welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Patiromer is a novel agent used to treat hyperkalemia and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated. The potential clinical outcomes and economic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with HF unable to otherwise tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia are unclear. The objective of this analysis was to model the potential pharmacoeconomic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with a history of hyperkalemia that prevents them from utilizing spironolactone.MethodsWe performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with patiromer, spironolactone, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV HF compared with ACEI alone. A Markov model was constructed to simulate a cohort of 65-year-old patients diagnosed with HF from the payer perspective across the lifetime horizon. Clinical inputs were derived from the RALES and OPAL-HK randomized trials of spironolactone and patiromer, respectively. Utility estimates and costs were derived from the literature and list prices. Outcomes assessed included hospitalization, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probability sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model findings.ResultsTreatment with patiromer-spironolactone-ACEI was projected to increase longevity compared with ACEI alone (5.29 vs. 4.62 life-years gained, respectively), greater QALYs (2.79 vs. 2.60), and costs (US$28,200 vs. US$18,200), giving an ICER of US$52,700 per QALY gained. The ICERs ranged from US$40,000 to US$85,800 per QALY gained in 1-way sensitivity analyses.ConclusionOur results suggest that the use of spironolactone-patiromer-ACEI may provide clinical benefit and good economic value in patients with NYHA class III-IV HF unable to tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia.","[Bounthavong, Mark; Veenstra, David L.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,HSB H375-P,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Butler, Javed] SUNY Stony Brook, Div Cardiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dolan, Chantal M.; Fisher, Kathryn A.] CMD Consulting, Sandy, UT USA; [Dunn, Jeffrey D.] Magellan Rx, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Oestreicher, Nina] Relypsa Inc, Epidemiol HEOR & Observat Res, Redwood City, CA USA; [Oestreicher, Nina] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pitt, Bertram] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hauptman, Paul J.] St Louis Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, St Louis, MO 63104 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Saint Louis University,"Veenstra, DL (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,HSB H375-P,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",veenstra@uw.edu,,,"Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company","Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company","Funded by Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company.",,37,13,14,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12.0,,,,,1463,1473,,10.1007/s40273-018-0709-3,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30194623.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000451183300007,0

We show that a similar relationship between potential refutability of a model and existence of more efficient estimators is present in much broader settings. Specifically, a condition we name local overidentification is shown to be equivalent to both the existence of specification tests with nontrivial local power and the existence of more efficient estimators of some smooth parameters in general semi/nonparametric models. Under our notion of local overidentification, various locally nontrivial specification tests such as Hausman tests, incremental Sargan tests (or optimally weighted quasi likelihood ratio tests) naturally extend to general semi/nonparametric settings. We further obtain simple characterizations of local overidentification for general models of nonparametric conditional moment restrictions with possibly different conditioning sets. The results are applied to determining when semi/non-parametric models with endogeneity are locally testable, and when nonparametric plug-in and semiparametric two-step GMM estimators are semiparametrically efficient.

Based on no-arbitrage arguments, we derive backward stochastic differential equations associated with the replicating portfolios of long and short positions in the claim. This leads to the definition of buyer's and seller's XVA, which in turn identify a no-arbitrage interval. In the case that borrowing and lending rates coincide, we provide a fully explicit expression for the unique XVA, expressed as a percentage of the price of the traded claim, and for the corresponding replication strategies. In the general case of asymmetric funding, repo, and collateral rates, we study the semilinear partial differential equations characterizing buyer's and seller's XVA and show the existence of a unique classical solution to it.

In the unit root case, Anderson-Hsiao lagged variable instruments satisfy orthogonality conditions but are well known to be irrelevant. For a fixed time series sample size (T) IV is inconsistent and approaches a shifted Cauchy-distributed random variate as the cross-section sample size n -> infinity. But when T -> infinity, either for fixed n or as n -> infinity, IV is root T consistent and its limit distribution is a ratio of random variables that converges to twice a standard Cauchy as n -> infinity. In this case, the usual instruments are uncorrelated with the regressor but irrelevance does not prevent consistent estimation. The same Cauchy limit theory holds sequentially and jointly as (n, T)-> infinity with no restriction on the divergence rates of n and T. When the common autoregressive root rho = 1 + c/root T the panel comprises a collection of mildly integrated time series. In this case, the IV estimator is root n consistent for fixed T and root nT consistent with limit distribution N ( 0,4) when n, T -> infinity sequentially or jointly. These results are robust for common roots of the form rho = 1 + c/T-gamma for all gamma is an element of(0,1) and joint convergence holds. Limit normality holds but the variance changes when gamma = 1. When gamma > 1 joint convergence fails and sequential limits differ with different rates of convergence. These findings reveal the fragility of conventional Gaussian IV asymptotics to persistence in dynamic panel regressions.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Unlike the classical work of Stroock and Varadhan (Commun Pure Appl Math 22:345-400, 479-530, 1969) where the linear operator in the associated PDE is naturally defined from the corresponding diffusion process, the main difficulty in the nonlinear setting is to identify an appropriate class of nonlinear operators for the associated fully nonlinear PDEs. Based on the analysis of the martingale problem, we introduce the notion of weak solution for stochastic differential equations under nonlinear expectations and obtain an existence theorem under the Lipschitz continuity condition of the coefficients. The approach to establish the existence of weak solutions generalizes the classical Girsanov transformation method in that it no longer requires the two (probability) measures to be absolutely continuous.","[Guo, Xin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pan, Chen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore; [Peng, Shige] Shandong Univ, Sch Math, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; Shandong University,"Pan, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore.",xinguo@berkeley.edu; huoshanpc@126.com; peng@sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The QLU-C10D contains ten dimensions (Physical, Role, Social and Emotional Functioning; Pain, Fatigue, Sleep, Appetite, Nausea, Bowel Problems), each with four levels. To be used in cost-utility analysis, country-specific valuation sets are required. Objective The aim of this study was to provide Australian utility weights for the QLU-C10D. Methods An Australian online panel was quota-sampled to ensure population representativeness by sex and age (>= 18 years). Participants completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisting of 16 choice-pairs. Each pair comprised two QLU-C10D health states plus life expectancy. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression, parameterised to fit the quality-adjusted life-year framework. Utility weights were calculated as the ratio of each QOL dimension-level coefficient to the coefficient on life expectancy. Results A total of 1979 panel members opted in, 1904 (96%) completed at least one choice-pair, and 1846 (93%) completed all 16 choice-pairs. Dimension weights were generally monotonic: poorer levels within each dimension were generally associated with greater utility decrements. The dimensions that impacted most on choice were, in order, Physical Functioning, Pain, Role Functioning and Emotional Functioning. Oncology-relevant dimensions with moderate impact were Nausea and Bowel Problems. Fatigue, Trouble Sleeping and Appetite had relatively small impact. The value of the worst health state was - 0.096, somewhat worse than death. Conclusions This study provides the first country-specific value set for the QLU-C10D, which can facilitate cost-utility analyses when applied to data collected with the EORTC QLQ-C30, prospectively and retrospectively.","[King, Madeleine T.; Costa, Daniel S.

We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large (approximately $13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or about 5% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.","[Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Einav, Liran; Finkelstein, Amy; Mahoney, Neale] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mahoney, Neale] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Einav, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåStanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Einav, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",leinav@stanford.edu; afink@mit.edu; Neale.Mahoney@chicagobooth.edu,,,NIA [R01 AG032449]; Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago; National Science Foundation [SES-1730466],NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, five anonymous referees, our discussants Judy Chevalier and Mark Shepard, and many seminar participants for helpful comments.

The model that we consider also allows for the dependence between unobserved effects and regressors in both the selection and outcome equations and can accommodate the presence of predetermined covariates in the model. We use this model to estimate returns to scale for U.S. retail credit unions from 1996 to 2011.

Regularization is a statistical approach for avoiding over-parameterization, and it can reduce estimation and predictive variances compared to MLE. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, regularization is accomplished by the use of mean-zero priors, and the degree of parsimony can be optimized by numerically efficient out-of-sample cross-validation. This provides a consistent framework for comparing a variety of regularized MCMC models, such as those built with cubic splines, linear splines (as ours is), and the limiting case of non-regularized estimation.

Second, we propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating estimators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications arising from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effects present in the reverse regression. A real-time version of the strategy is provided that is suited for practical implementation. Simulations explore the finite sample performance of the strategy for dating market recovery.

The interaction of input-output networks with industry-level market structure affects the amplification of shocks and the pattern of diffusion in the model, generating cascades of firm entry and exit across the economy. In this model, sales provide a poor measure of the systemic importance of industries. Unlike the relevant notions of centrality in competitive constant-returns-to-scale models, systemic importance depends on the industry's role as both a supplier and a consumer of inputs, as well as the market structure of industries. A basic calibration of the model suggests that aggregate output is three times more volatile in response to labor productivity shocks when compared to a perfectly competitive model.","[Baqaee, David Rezza] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Baqaee, DR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",baqaee@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,33,40,56,12,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2018,86.0,5.0,,,,,1819,1838,,10.3982/ECTA15280,0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HB2AT,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000450837000009,0

Translucent playersmay achieve significantly more efficient outcomes than opaque ones. Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. CommonCounterfactual Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i believe that everyone else would still be rational even if i were to switch strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so on.

Despite results suggesting a negative answer, we provide a positive one. We give conditions under which all Markov equilibria display either saving at all wealth levels or dissaving at all wealth levels. Moreover, saving versus dissaving is determined by a simple condition comparing the interest rate to a threshold made up of impatience parameters only. Our robustness results illustrate a well-behaved side of the model and imply that qualitative behavior is determinate, dissipating indeterminacy concerns to the contrary (Krusell and Smith, 2003). We prove by construction that equilibria always exist and that multiplicity is present in some cases, highlighting that our robust predictions are not due to uniqueness.

The TCO framework incorporates the L1 norm of the difference between two consecutive allocations together with the principle of maximizing expected log return. We further solve the formulation via convex optimization, and obtain two closed-form portfolio update formulas, which follow the same principle as Proportional Portfolio Rebalancing (PPR) in industry. We empirically evaluate the proposed framework using four commonly used data-sets. Although these data-sets do not consider delisted firms and are thus subject to survival bias, empirical evaluations show that the proposed TCO framework may effectively handle reasonable transaction costs and improve existing strategies in the case of non-zero transaction costs.","[Li, Bin] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jialei] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Huang, Dingjiang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

We show that when the distributional weights on current and future utility in the Epstein-Zin time aggregator do not sum to 1, there is an asymptote in the responses to such a shock with unit intertemporal elasticity of substitution. In the Basu-Bundick model, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is set near unity and the preference shock only hits current utility, so the sum of the weights differs from 1. We show that when we restrict the weights to sum to 1, the asymptote disappears and preference volatility shocks no longer have large effects.

Existing index-based longevity hedging strategies mitigate the risk associated with period effects, but often overlook cohort effects. The negligence of cohort effects may lead to sub-optimal hedge effectiveness, if the liability being hedged is a deferred pension or annuity which involves cohorts that are not covered by the data sample. In this paper, we propose a new hedging strategy that incorporates both period and cohort effects. The resulting longevity hedge is a value hedge, reducing the uncertainty surrounding the tau-year ahead value of the liability being hedged. The proposed method is illustrated with data from the male population of England and Wales. It is found that the benefit of incorporating cohort effects into a longevity hedging strategy depends heavily on the persistence of cohort effects and the choice of q-forwards.

We consider both intertemporal and intratemporal choices, and identify intensive and extensive responses in a consistent life-cycle framework, using US CEX data. Heterogeneity is due to observables, such as age, wealth, hours worked, and the wage level, as well as to unobservable tastes for leisure: the median Marshallian elasticity for hours worked is 0.18, with corresponding Hicksian elasticity of 0.54 and Frisch elasticity of 0.87. At the 90th percentile, these values are 0.79, 1.16, and 1.92. Responses at the extensive margin explain about 54% of the total labor supply response for women under 30, although this declines with age. Aggregate elasticities are higher in recessions, and increase with the length of the recession. The heterogeneity at the micro level means that the aggregate labor supply elasticity is not a structural parameter: any aggregate elasticity will depend on the demographic structure of the economy as well as the distribution of wealth and the particular point in the business cycle.","[Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter; Low, Hamish] IFS, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Low, Hamish] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander, Spain",University of London; University College London; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford; Universidad de Cantabria,"Attanasio, O (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Attanasio, O (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåIFS, London, England.;Attanasio, O (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",o.attanasio@ucl.ac.uk; peter_l@ifs.org.uk; hamish.low@economics.ox.ac.uk; virginia.sanchez@unican.es,"Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",ESRC Professorial Fellowship; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Spanish MCYT [ECO2009-09614],ESRC Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Spanish MCYT(Spanish Government),"We are grateful for a number of useful conversations with Joe Altonji, Richard Blundell, Guy Laroque, Costas Meghir, Richard Rogerson, and Tom Sargent.

Many tests of this type can be interpreted as C(a) tests, as in Neyman (1959), and shown to be locally asymptotically optimal. These C(a) tests will be contrasted with a new approach to likelihood ratio testing for general mixture models. The latter tests are based on estimation of general nonparametric mixing distribution with the Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) maximum likelihood estimator. Recent developments in convex optimization have dramatically improved upon earlier EM methods for computation of these estimators, and recent results on the large sample behavior of likelihood ratios involving such estimators yield a tractable form of asymptotic inference. Improvement in computation efficiency also facilitates the use of a bootstrap method to determine critical values that are shown to work better than the asymptotic critical values in finite samples. Consistency of the bootstrap procedure is also formally established. We compare performance of the two approaches identifying circumstances in which each is preferred.","[Gu, Jiaying; Volgushev, Stanislav] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Koenker, Roger] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Toronto; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Gu, JY (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",jiaying.gu@utoronto.ca,,,NSF [SES-11-53548]; German Research Foundation [SFB 823]; DFG [VO1799/1-1],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was partially supported by NSF grant SES-11-53548 and Project C1 of the SFB 823 of the German Research Foundation.

The clinical efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (in addition to phosphate binders and vitamin D and/or analogues [PB/VD]) was evaluated in three phase III studies, including two placebo-controlled trials and a head-to-head study versus the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model for economic evaluation of etelcalcetide compared with cinacalcet. Methods We developed a life-time Markov model including potential treatment effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and subjects' persistence. Long-term efficacy of etelcalcetide was extrapolated from the reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the phase III trials and the available data from the outcomes study in cinacalcet (EVOLVE trial). Etelcalcetide was compared with cinacalcet, both in addition to PB/VD. We applied unit costs averaged from five European countries and a range of potential etelcalcetide pricing options assuming parity price to weekly use of cinacalcet and varying it by a 15 or 30% increase. Results Compared with cinacalcet, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of etelcalcetide was (sic)1,355 per QALY, (sic)24,521 per QALY, and (sic)47,687 per QALY for the three prices explored. The results were robust across the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our modelling approach enabled cost-utility assessment of the novel therapy for SHPT based on the observed and extrapolated data. This model can be used for local adaptations in the context of reimbursement assessment.","[Stollenwerk, Bjorn; Parfrey, Patrick] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Stollenwerk, Bjorn] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Iannazzo, Sergio] SIHS Hlth Econ Consulting, Via Sebastiano Caboto 45, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Akehurst, Ron] BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Adena, Michael] Datalyt Pty Ltd, 19-12 Trevillian Quay, Kingston, ACT 2603, Australia; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Dehmel, Bastian; Belozeroff, Vasily] Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Parfrey, Patrick] Mem Univ, POB 4200, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow; Amgen; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Stollenwerk, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAmgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland.;Stollenwerk, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåHelmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",bjoerns@amgen.com,"Stollenwerk, Bj√∂rn/G-5408-2013; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),"Financial support for this study was provided by Amgen.

However, the values derived from initial DCE studies vary widely. We hypothesize that these findings indicate the presence of unknown sources of bias that must be recognized and minimized. Against this background, we studied whether values derived from a DCE are sensitive to how well the DCE design spans the severity range. Methods We constructed an experiment involving three variants of DCE tasks for health state valuation: standard DCE, DCE-death, and DCE-duration. For each type of DCE, an experimental design was generated under two different conditions, enabling a comparison of health state values derived from current best practice Bayesian efficient DCE designs with values derived from 'severity-stratified' designs that control for coverage of the severity range in health state selection. About 3000 respondents participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of the six study arms. Results Imposing the severity-stratified restriction had a large effect on health states sampled for the DCE-duration approach. The unstratified efficient design returned a skewed distribution of selected health states, and this introduced bias. The choice probability of bad health states was underestimated, and time trade-offs to avoid bad states were overestimated, resulting in too low values. Imposing the same restriction had limited effect in the DCE-death approach and standard DCE. Conclusion Variation in DCE-derived values can be partially explained by differences in how well selected health states spanned the severity range. Imposing a 'severity stratification' on DCE-duration designs is a validity requirement.","[Lim, Sesil; Jonker, Marcel F.; Oppe, Mark; Donkers, Bas; Stolk, Elly] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Choice Modelling Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lim, Sesil; Donkers, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jonker, Marcel F.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jonker, Marcel F.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Oppe, Mark; Stolk, Elly] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Duke University,"Lim, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåErasmus Univ, Erasmus Choice Modelling Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Lim, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåErasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",lim@ese.eur.nl,"Donkers, Bas/B-6082-2008","Donkers, Bas/0000-0002-0412-4276; Lim, Sesil/0000-0002-2227-8906",EuroQol Research Foundation [2015300],EuroQol Research Foundation,This work has received financial support from the EuroQol Research Foundation grant number 2015300.,,28,8,9,1,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11.0,,,,,1377,1389,,10.1007/s40273-018-0694-6,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30030818.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446909400008,0

Our framework includes many nonparametric testing problems in a unified framework, with a number of possible applications in auction models, game theoretic models, wage inequality, and revealed preferences. Our test involves a one-sided version of L-p functionals of kernel-type estimators (1 <= p < infinity) and is easy to implement in general, mainly due to its recourse to the bootstrap method. The bootstrap procedure is based on the nonparametric bootstrap applied to kernel-based test statistics, with an option of estimating contact sets. We provide regularity conditions under which the bootstrap test is asymptotically valid uniformly over a large class of distributions, including cases where the limiting distribution of the test statistic is degenerate. Our bootstrap test is shown to exhibit good power properties in Monte Carlo experiments, and we provide a general form of the local power function. As an illustration, we consider testing implications from auction theory, provide primitive conditions for our test, and demonstrate its usefulness by applying our test to real data.

It has been shown that the identification of the regression function from the conditional expectation of the dependent variable on the instrument relies on the completeness of the distribution of the endogenous regressor conditional on the instrument, i.e., f (x vertical bar z). We show that (1) if the deviation of the conditional density f (x vertical bar z(k)) from a known complete sequence of functions is less than a sequence of values determined by the complete sequence in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0), then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete, and (2) if the conditional density f (x vertical bar z) can form a linearly independent sequence {f (. vertical bar z(k)) : k = 1,2,...} in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0) and its relative deviation from a known complete sequence of functions under some norm is finite then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete. We use these general results to provide specific sufficient conditions for completeness in three different specifications of the relationship between the endogenous regressor x and the instrumental variable z.","[Hu, Yingyao] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Shiu, Ji-Liang] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Johns Hopkins University; Jinan University,"Hu, YY (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",yhu@jhu.edu,,,,,,,35,12,15,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The FEF-IV allows for endogenous time-invariant regressors but assumes that there exists a sufficient number of instruments for such regressors. It is shown that the FEF and FEF-IV estimators are root N-consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The FEF estimator is compared with the Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (FEVD) estimator proposed by Plumper and Troeger (2007) and conditions under which the two estimators are equivalent are established. It is also shown that the variance estimator proposed for FEVD estimator is inconsistent and its use could lead to misleading inference. Alternative variance estimators are proposed for both FEF and FEF-IV estimators which are shown to be consistent under fairly general conditions. The small sample properties of the FEF and FEF-IV estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, and it is shown that FEF has smaller bias and RMSE, unless an intercept is included in the second stage of the FEVD procedure which renders the FEF and FEVD estimators identical. The FEVD procedure, however, results in substantial size distortions since it uses incorrect standard errors. In the case where some of the time-invariant regressors are endogenous, the FEF-IV procedure is compared with a modified version of Hausman and Taylor (1981) (HT) estimator. It is shown that both estimators perform well and have similar small sample properties. But the application of standard HT procedure, that incorrectly assumes a subset of time-varying regressors are uncorrelated with the individual effects, will yield biased estimates and significant size distortions.","[Pesaran, M.

We make connections with the theory of large deviations. We concentrate on sequences of semicomplete markets where in the nth market, the claim Bn admits the decomposition Bn=Dn+Yn. Here, Dn is replicable by trading in the underlying assets Sn, but Yn is independent of Sn. Under broad conditions, we may assume that Yn vanishes in accordance with a large deviations principle (LDP) as n grows. In this setting, for an exponential investor, we identify the limit of the average indifference price pn(qn), for qn units of Bn, as n. We show that if |qn|, the limiting price typically differs from the price obtained by assuming bounded positions supn|qn|<, and the difference is explicitly identifiable using large deviations theory. Furthermore, we show that optimal purchase quantities occur at the large deviations scaling, and hence large positions arise endogenously in this setting.","[Robertson, Scott] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Spiliopoulos, Konstantinos] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Boston University,"Robertson, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBoston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",scottrob@bu.edu,"Robertson, Scott/L-3926-2016","Robertson, Scott/0000-0003-4258-6508","National Science Foundation [DMS-1312491/1651180, GS100000001, GS100000001 DMS-1312124]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1613159] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"S.

Our identification results are constructive and encompass a range of special cases with varying demands on the exogenous variation provided by instruments and the shape of the joint density of the structural errors. The most important results demonstrate identification when instruments have only limited variation. Even when instruments vary only over a small open ball, relatively mild conditions on the joint density suffice.

The technique involves sampling parameters from their respective distributions (rather than simply using mean/median parameter values). Guidance in the literature, and from health technology assessment bodies, on the number of simulations that should be performed suggests a sufficient number', or until convergence', which is seldom defined. The objective of this tutorial is to describe possible outcomes from PSA, discuss appropriate levels of accuracy, and present guidance by which an analyst can determine if a sufficient number of simulations have been conducted, such that results are considered to have converged. The proposed approach considers the variance of the outcomes of interest in cost-effectiveness analysis as a function of the number of simulations. A worked example of the technique is presented using results from a published model, with recommendations made on best practice. While the technique presented remains essentially arbitrary, it does give a mechanism for assessing the level of simulation error, and thus represents an advance over current practice of a round number of simulations with no assessment of model convergence.","[Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, London, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.; Bullement, Ash] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Bullement, Ash] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Briggs, Andrew] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stevenson, Matthew D.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; University of Glasgow; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of Alberta; University of Sheffield,"Hatswell, AJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUCL, London, England.;Hatswell, AJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDelta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England.",ahatswell@deltahat.co.uk,"Bullement, Ash/IVV-3411-2023; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Bullement, Ash/AEO-3423-2022; Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Bullement, Ash/0000-0001-7091-0972; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",,,,,23,54,58,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12.0,,,,,1421,1426,,10.1007/s40273-018-0697-3,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30051268.0,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000451183300003,0

We provide computationally attractive procedures to construct confidence sets (CSs) for identified sets of the full parameter vector and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood or a vector of moment equalities or inequalities. The CSs are based on level sets of optimal criterion functions (such as likelihoods, optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM criterions). The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the quasi-posterior distribution of the criterion. We establish new Bernstein-von Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified models. These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but potentially conservative coverage in models whose local tangent spaces are convex cones. Further, our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities. We provide local power properties and uniform validity of our CSs over classes of DGPs that include point- and partially-identified models.

This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the long-memory behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the geometry of the network, while being relatively insensitive to the specific behavior of individual agents.","[Schennach, Susanne M.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Schennach, SM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBrown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",smschenn@brown.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1061263/1156347, SES-1357401, SES-1659334]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author would like to thank Eric Renault, Adam McCloskey, Florian Gunsilius, seminar participants at Cemmap/UCL, at the University of Cambridge, and at the Harvard/MIT Econometrics seminar, and anonymous referees for useful comments, and acknowledges support from NSF Grants SES-1061263/1156347, SES-1357401, and SES-1659334.",,54,5,5,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2018,86.0,6.0,,,,,2221,2248,,10.3982/ECTA11930,0,,,28,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HD9DA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000452859800010,0

We refer to the proposed method as One Covariate at a Time Multiple Testing (OCMT) procedure, and use ideas from the multiple testing literature to control the probability of selecting the approximating model, the false positive rate, and the false discovery rate. OCMT is easy to interpret, relates to classical statistical analysis, is valid under general assumptions, is faster to compute, and performs well in small samples.

As our main behavioral assumption, we postulate that agents follow social learning rules that satisfy imperfect recall, according to which they treat the current beliefs of their neighbors as sufficient statistics for the entire history of their observations. We augment this assumption with various restrictions on how agents process the information provided by their neighbors and obtain representation theorems for the corresponding learning rules (including the canonical model of DeGroot). We then obtain general long-run learning results that are not tied to the learning rules' specific functional forms, thus identifying the fundamental forces that lead to learning, non-learning, and mislearning in social networks. Our results illustrate that, in the presence of imperfect recall, long-run aggregation of information is closely linked to (i) the rate at which agents discount their neighbors' information over time, (ii) the curvature of agents' social learning rules, and (iii) whether their initial tendencies are amplified or moderated as a result of social interactions.","[Molavi, Pooya] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Jadbabaie, Ali] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Molavi, P (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mpooya@mit.edu; alirezat@kellogg.northwestern.edu; jadbabai@mit.edu,"Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/KCX-9521-2024; Molavi, Pooya/KCX-9445-2024","Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/0000-0002-6860-1836; Molavi, Pooya/0000-0002-1866-9365",Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-12-1-0509],Army Research Office (MURI)(MURI),"An earlier draft of this paper was circulated under the title Foundations of non-Bayesian Social Learning.

Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of various procedures in terms of exact coverage rates and lengths of the confidence intervals. These include the procedures of Bai (1997) based on the asymptotic distribution under a shrinking shift framework, Elliott and Muller (2007) based on inverting a test locally invariant to the magnitude of break, Eo and Morley (2015) based on inverting a likelihood ratio test, and various bootstrap procedures. On the basis of achieving an exact coverage rate that is closest to the nominal level, Elliott and Muller's (2007) approach is by far the best one. However, this comes with a very high cost in terms of the length of the confidence intervals. When the errors are serially correlated and dealing with a change in intercept or a change in the coefficient of a stationary regressor with a high signal-to-noise ratio, the length of the confidence interval increases and approaches the whole sample as the magnitude of the change increases. The same problem occurs in models with a lagged dependent variable, a common case in practice. This drawback is not present for the other methods, which have similar properties.

Finite automata, a bounded model of computation, have been extensively used to compactly represent strategies for these games and are a standard tool in game theoretic analyses. However, inference over these strategies in repeated games is challenging since the number of possible strategies grows exponentially with the number of repetitions yet behavioural data are often sparse and noisy. As a result, previous approaches start by specifying a finite hypothesis space of automata that does not allow for flexibility. This limitation hinders the discovery of novel strategies that may be used by humans but are not anticipated a priori by current theory. Here we present a new probabilistic model for strategy inference in repeated games by exploiting non-parametric Bayesian modelling. With simulated data, we show that the model is effective at inferring the true strategy rapidly and from limited data, which leads to accurate predictions of future behaviour. When applied to experimental data of human behaviour in a repeated prisoner's dilemma, we uncover strategies of varying complexity and diversity.","[Kleiman-Weiner, Max; Tenenbaum, Joshua B.] MIT, Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhou, Penghui] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Kleiman-Weiner, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMIT, Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",maxkw@mit.edu; jbt@mit.edu; phzhou@mit.edu,"peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023","peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; /0000-0002-6067-3659","Hertz Foundation; NSF-GRFP; Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM); NSF STC [CCF-1231216]; ONR [N00014-13-1-0333]","Hertz Foundation; NSF-GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM); NSF STC(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research)","We thank Victor Chernozukov, Muriel Niederle, Juuso Toikka, Erez Yoeli and the anonymous referee for comments and improvements.

First, we estimate univariate and multivariate models of cash-flow (consumption, output, dividends) growth that feature measurement errors, time-varying volatilities, and mixed-frequency observations. Monthly consumption data are important for identifying the stochastic volatility process; yet the data are contaminated, which makes the inclusion of measurement errors essential for identifying the predictable component. Second, we develop a novel state-space model for cash flows and asset prices that imposes the pricing restrictions of a representative-agent endowment economy with recursive preferences. To estimate this model, we use a particle MCMC approach that exploits the conditional linear structure of the approximate equilibrium. Once asset return data are included in the estimation, we find even stronger evidence for the persistent component and are able to identify three volatility processes: the one for the predictable cash-flow component is crucial for asset pricing, whereas the other two are important for tracking the data. Our model generates asset prices that are largely consistent with the data in terms of sample moments and predictability features. The state-space approach allows us to track over time the evolution of the predictable component, the volatility processes, the decomposition of the equity premium into risk factors, and the variance decomposition of asset prices.","[Schorfheide, Frank] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Song, Dongho] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Yaron, Amir] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Boston College; University of Pennsylvania,"Schorfheide, F (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",schorf@ssc.upenn.edu; dongho.song@bc.edu; yaron@wharton.upenn.edu,"Song, Dongho/GXA-0139-2022","Schorfheide, Frank/0000-0002-4256-634X","National Science Foundation [SES 1424843]; Rodney White center; Jacob Levy center; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1425740] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1424843] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rodney White center; Jacob Levy center; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank a co-editor, four anonymous referees, Bent J.

While the Logit Mixture model with random parameters is mostly used to account for variation across individuals, preferences may also vary across different choice situations of the same individual. Up to this point. Logit Mixtures incorporating both inter- and intra-consumer heterogeneity are estimated with the classical Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) procedure. The MSL procedure becomes computationally expensive with an increasing sample size and can be burdensome in the presence of a multi-modal likelihood function. We therefore propose a Hierarchical Bayes estimator for Logit Mixtures with both levels of heterogeneity. It builds on the Allenby-Train procedure, which considers only inter-consumer heterogeneity. To test the proposed procedures, we analyze how well the true patterns of heterogeneity are recovered in a simulation environment. Results from the Monte Carlo simulation suggest that falsely ignoring intra-consumer heterogeneity despite its presence in the data leads to biased estimates and a decreased goodness of fit. The latter is confirmed by a real-world example of explaining mode choices for GPS traces. We further show that the runtime of the proposed estimator is substantially faster than for the corresponding MSL estimator. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a model-based practical framework to predict future occupancy from historical occupancy data alone. The framework consists of two modules: estimation of model parameters, and occupancy prediction. At the core of the predictive framework, a queuing model is employed to describe the stochastic occupancy change of a parking facility. While the underlying queuing model can be any reasonable model, we demonstrate the framework with the well-established continuous-time Markov M\M\C\C queue in this paper. The possibility of adopting a different queuing model that can potentially incorporate the parking searching process is also discussed. The parameter estimation module and the occupancy prediction module are both built on the underlying queuing model. To apply the estimation and prediction methods in real world, a few practical considerations are accounted for in the framework with methods to handle variations of arrival and departure patterns from day to day and within a day, including special events. The proposed framework and models are validated using both simulated and real data. Our San Francisco case studies demonstrate that the parameters estimated offline can lead to accurate predictions of parking facility occupancy both with and without real-time update. We also performed extensive numerical experiments to compare the proposed framework and methods with several pure machine-learning methods in recent literature. It is found that our approach delivers equal or better performance, but requires a computation time that is orders of magnitude less to tune and train the model. Additionally, our approach can predict for any time in the future with one training process, while pure machine-learning methods have to train a specific model for a different prediction interval to achieve the same level of accuracy.

Costs arise from increased healthcare spending and work-related social benefits, while smoking itself provides significant revenue for government from tobacco taxes. To better understand the public economic impact of smoking and smoking cessation therapies, this study developed a government perspective framework for assessing smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality and associated public costs. This framework includes changes in lifetime tax revenue and health costs, as well as changes in tobacco tax revenue, from fewer smokers. Methods: A modified generational accounting framework was developed to assess relationships between smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality and public economic consequences of smoking, including lifetime tax revenue gains/losses, government social transfers, and health spending. Based on the current prevalence of smoking in South Korean males, a cohort model was developed for smokers, former-smokers, and never-smokers. The model simulated the lifetime discounted fiscal transfers for different age cohorts in 5 year age bands, and the return on investment (ROI) from smoking cessation therapy. Results: Former smokers are estimated to generate higher lifetime earnings and direct tax revenues and lower lifetime healthcare costs due to the reduction of smoking-attributable mortality and morbidity compared to smokers, even after accounting for reduced tobacco taxes paid. Based on the costs of public investments in varenicline, this study estimated a ROI from 1.4-1.7, depending on treatment age, with higher ROI in younger cohorts, with an average ROI of 1.6 for those aged less than 65. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that reductions in smoking can generate positive public economic benefits for government, even after accounting for lost tobacco tax revenues. The results described here are likely applicable to countries having similar underlying smoking prevalence, comparable taxation rates, and social benefit protection provided to individuals with smoking-related conditions.","[Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.; Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Global Market Access Solut, St Prex, Switzerland; [Baker, Christine L.] Pfizer Inc, Patient & Hlth Impact, New York, NY USA; [Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece",University of Groningen; Pfizer; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Connolly, MP (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Groningen, Dept Pharm PharmacoEcon & PharmacoEpidemiol, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697","Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY","Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY(Pfizer)","This study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY.",,28,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study (NCT01564537), 722 patients with RRMM following 1-3 prior lines of therapy received Rd plus ixazomib (ixazomib-Rd; n = 360) or matching placebo (placebo-Rd; n = 362) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Healthcare resource utilization data were captured on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle, every 4 weeks during follow-up for progression-free survival, and every 12 weeks during subsequent follow-up, and included medical encounters (length of stay, inpatient, outpatient, and reason) and number of missing days from work or other activities for patients and caregivers. Results: Exposure-adjusted rates of hospitalization were similar between the ixazomib-Rd and placebo-Rd arms, at 0.530 and 0.564 per patient year (ppy), respectively, as were outpatient visit rates (3.305 and 3.355 ppy). Mean length of hospitalization per patient was 10.0 and 10.8 days, respectively. In both arms, hospitalization and outpatient visit rates were higher in patients with two or three prior lines of treatment (ixazomib-Rd: 0.632 and 3.909 ppy; placebo-Rd: 0.774 and 3.539 ppy) compared with patients with one prior line (ixazomib-Rd: 0.460 and 2.888 ppy; placebo-Rd: 0.436 and 3.243 ppy). Patients and their caregivers who missed any work or other activity missed a median of 7 and 5 days in the ixazomib-Rd arm, respectively, vs 8 and 4 days with placebo-Rd. Limitations: The study was not powered for a statistical comparison of healthcare resource utilization between treatment arms, nor did it capture costs associated with utilization of the identified healthcare resources.

Molecular monitoring assists in the timely detection of primary or secondary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and is a recommended practice by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. An economic model was developed to estimate the potential impact of CML monitoring vs lack of monitoring on patient healthcare costs. Methods: An Excel-based decision-analytic economic model was developed from a US payer perspective. The model was used to estimate the expected healthcare cost differences between regular molecular monitoring of CML patients and lack of monitoring. CML progression rates among patients with vs without monitoring, the annual cost of CML progression, the average number of monitoring tests per year, and the average cost per RT-qPCR monitoring test were incorporated into the model. Univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Based on estimates in published literature, disease progression to the accelerated/blast phase occurs among 0.35% of patients with monitoring and 5.12% of patients without monitoring, and the annual cost of CML progression is $136,308 per patient year. The analysis found that total healthcare costs, including the costs associated with CML progression and RT-qPCR monitoring tests (three tests per year), were $1,142 for patients with monitoring and $6,982 for patients without monitoring (difference = $5,840). In a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients with CML, achieving a 100% monitoring rate was associated with a total cost-savings of $584,005 compared to a 0% monitoring rate. This cost-savings remained consistent under both univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Regular CML monitoring was associated with improved outcomes among CML patients and, consequently, reduced healthcare costs.","[Jabbour, Elias J.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Siegartel, Lisa R.; Makenbaeva, Dinara] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa; Menges, Brandy] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Jabbour, EJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Box 428,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ejabbour@mdanderson.org,"Jabbour, Elias/IWM-6804-2023",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,12,8,8,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Although many control strategies, such as static and dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of standby buses.

In order to provide more realistic traffic data for estimations of environmental impacts, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models have been adopted in transportation planning and traffic management models concerning environmental sustainability. This review summarizes and examines the recent methodological advances of DTA models in environmentally sustainable road transportation applications including traffic signal control concerning vehicular emissions and emission pricing. A classification of emission estimation models and their integration with DTA models are accordingly reviewed as supplementary to the existing reviews. Finally, a variety of future research prospects of DTA for environmentally sustainable road transportation research are discussed. In particular, this review also points out that at present the research about DTA models in conjunction with noise predictive models is relatively deficient. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In this paper, we present a behavioral kinematic wave model to explain the three bottleneck effects of sags and tunnels. Assuming increasing time gaps, we derive location-dependent triangular fundamental diagrams to explain the capacity reduction effect; with a bounded acceleration constraint on the stationary states inside the capacity reduction zone, we demonstrate the occurrence of capacity drop and derive a formula to calculate the dropped capacity from the fundamental diagram, road geometry, and acceleration process; from the structure of continuous standing waves we verify the low acceleration rate out of the upstream queue. We also present a simplified phenomenological model of capacity drop at sag/tunnel bottlenecks and two Cell Transmission Models for numerical simulations. With four stationary trajectories at the Kobotoke tunnel in Japan, we calibrate and validate the behavioral model and find that the theoretical predictions match the observations very well. This study can help to develop better design and control strategies to improve the performance of a sag or tunnel bottleneck. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although this practice has been justified by computational tractability and data constraints, it can introduce arbitrary changes to choice-share predictions. We isolate and characterize the implications of using composite vehicles for choice prediction, given exogenously determined model parameters. We first identify correction factors needed for composite models to predict choice shares that are consistent with those from models that use the full set of disaggregated elemental alternatives. We then assess the distortion of choice-share predictions under various composite specifications and partial corrections using two case studies based on models in the literature used in transportation and energy policymaking: (1) we examine a logit model without alternative-specific constants (ASCs) and find that the distortion in share predictions due to composite specification is substantial and can be larger than variation due to parameter uncertainty; (2) we examine counterfactual predictions of a nested logit model with ASCs based on the NEMS and LVChoice models and find that composite models using ASCs can mitigate or eliminate distortion in some, but not all, counterfactual scenarios. In particular, the distortion is larger when the scenario significantly affects the differences in elemental membership or utility heterogeneity between composite groups. We provide explicit correction factors for composite models with and without ASCs that can be used to take advantage of the tractability of composite models while ensuring that their choice-share predictions exactly match those of their corresponding elemental models in counterfactual and forecasting scenarios.

The purpose of this study was to benchmark healthcare resource utilization and costs for patients with THA via AA relative to matched patients. Materials and methods: This study queried Medicare claims data (2012-2014) to identify patients who received THA via an AA from experienced surgeons, and matched these patients to a control cohort (all THA approaches). Direct and propensity-score matching were employed to maximize similarity between patients and hospitals in the two cohorts. Hospital length of stay (LOS), the proportion of patients discharged to home or home health, and post-acute claim payments during the 90-day episode were assessed. Generalized estimating equations were applied to control for imbalances between the cohorts and clustering of outcomes within hospitals. Results: A total of 1,794 patients were included after patient matching. Patients who received AA had significantly lower mean hospital LOS vs patients in the control group (2.061.36 vs 2.98 +/- 1.58 days, p<.0001). The adjusted proportion of patients discharged to home was nearly 20 percentage points higher in the AA cohort vs the control cohort (87.3% vs 68.7%, p<.0001). Post-acute claim payments for AA patients were nearly 50% lower than those for control patients ($4,139 vs $7,465, p<.0001). Conclusion: AA patients had significantly lower post-acute care resource use when compared to control patients. Further research is warranted to evaluate the cost effectiveness of AA among surgeons of varying experience levels.","[Kamath, Atul F.] Univ Penn, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Chitnis, Abhishek S.; Holy, Chantal] Johnson & Johnson Co, Epidemiol Med Devices, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Lerner, Jason] Johnson & Johnson Co, Hlth Econ & Market Access, Raynham, MA USA; [Curtin, Brian] OrthoCarolina, Charlotte, NC USA; [Lochow, Steve] St Marys Hosp, Scott Orthoped Ctr, Huntington, WV USA; [DeCook, Charles] Northside Hosp, Arthrit & Total Joint Specialists, Atlanta, GA USA; [Matta, Joel M.] St Johns Ctr, Hip & Pelvis Inst, Santa Monica, CA USA",University of Pennsylvania; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Chitnis, AS (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJohnson & Johnson Co, Real World Analyt & Res Med Devices, 410 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",achitni@its.jnj.com,,"Holy, Chantal/0000-0002-5901-1156",Johnson Johnson (JnJ),Johnson Johnson (JnJ),This study was funded by Johnson & Johnson (JnJ).,,23,13,13,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in MM in the US was assessed from societal and payer perspectives. Methods: The XGEVA Global Economic Model was developed by integrating data from the phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with zoledronic acid for the prevention of SREs in MM. SRE rates were adjusted to reflect the real-world incidence. The model included utility decrements for SREs, administration, serious adverse events (SAEs), and disease progression. Drug, administration, SRE management, SAEs, and anti-MM treatment costs were based on data from published studies. For the societal perspective, the model additionally included SRE-related direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, the use of denosumab resulted in an incremental cost of US$26,329 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.2439, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US$107,939 and a NMB of US$10,259 in favor of denosumab. Results were sensitive to SRE rates and PFS parameters. Limitations: Costs were estimated from multiple sources, which varied by tumor type, patient population, country, and other parameters. PFS and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Conclusion: Denosumab's efficacy in delaying or preventing SREs, potential to improve PFS, and lack of renal toxicity make it a cost-effective option for the prevention of SREs in MM compared with zoledronic acid.","[Raje, Noopur] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Canc Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Roodman, Garson David] Indiana Univ, Simon Canc Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Willenbacher, Wolfgang] Innsbruck Univ Hosp Internal Med Hematol & Oncol, Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Innsbruck, Austria; [Shimizu, Kazuyuki] Natl Hosp Org Higashi Nagoya Natl Hosp, Dept Hematol Oncol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Garcia-Sanz, Ramon] Hosp Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Terpos, Evangelos] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Alexandra Gen Hosp, Athens, Greece; [Kennedy, Lisa] Epiphany, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sabatelli, Lorenzo; Intorcia, Michele] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Hechmati, Guy] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Salamanca; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens Medical School; Alexandra Hospital; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen,"Intorcia, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAmgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland.",intorcia@amgen.com,"Shimizu, Kazuyuki/GVT-4698-2022; Garcia-Sanz, Ramon/B-7986-2017; Terpos, Evangelos/AAD-3667-2019","Shimizu, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-4847-0197; Garcia-Sanz, Ramon/0000-0003-4120-2787; Terpos, Evangelos/0000-0001-5133-1422","Amgen, Inc","Amgen, Inc(Amgen)","This study was funded by Amgen, Inc.",,59,15,19,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper, we develop a reliable sensor location model that aims at optimizing the location of sensors so as to maximize the accuracy of object positioning/surveillance under the risk of possible sensor disruptions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and develop solution approaches based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm with an embedded approximation subroutine.

In FY 2017, 769 hospitals incurred payment reductions totaling $430 million. This study analyzes how improvements in the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), based on the implementation of a cranberry-treatment regimen, impact hospitals' HAC scores and likelihood of avoiding the Medicare-reimbursement penalty. Methods: A simulation model is developed and implemented using public data from the CMS' Hospital Compare website to determine how hospitals' unilateral and simultaneous adoption of cranberry to improve CAUTI outcomes can affect HAC scores and the likelihood of a hospital incurring the Medicare payment reduction, given results on cranberry effectiveness in preventing CAUTI based on scientific trials. The simulation framework can be adapted to consider other initiatives to improve hospitals' HAC scores. Results: Nearly all simulated hospitals improved their overall HAC score by adopting cranberry as a CAUTI preventative, assuming mean effectiveness from scientific trials. Many hospitals with HAC scores in the lowest quartile of the HAC-score distribution and subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions can improve their scores sufficiently through adopting a cranberry-treatment regimen to avoid payment reduction. Limitations: The study was unable to replicate exactly the data used by CMS to establish HAC scores for FY 2018. The study assumes that hospitals subject to the Medicare payment reduction were not using cranberry as a prophylactic treatment for their catheterized patients, but is unable to confirm that this is true in all cases. The study also assumes that hospitalized catheter patients would be able to consume cranberry in either juice or capsule form, but this may not be true in 100% of cases. Conclusion: Most hospitals can improve their HAC scores and many can avoid Medicare reimbursement reductions if they are able to attain a percentage reduction in CAUTI comparable to that documented for cranberry-treatment regimes in the existing literature.","[Saitone, T.

Adapted from the shooting heuristic proposed by Zhou et al. (2017) and Ma et al. (2017), this model confines each vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise quadratic function with no more than five pieces and lets all trajectories in the same platoon share identical acceleration and deceleration rates. Similar to the shooting heuristic, the proposed simplified model is able to control the overall smoothness of a platoon of connected automated vehicles and approximately optimize traffic performance in terms of fuel efficiency and driving comfort. While the shooting heuristic relies on numerical meta-heuristic algorithms that cannot ensure solution optimality, we discover a set of elegant theoretical properties for the general objective function and the associated constraints in the proposed simplified model, and consequentially propose an efficient analytical algorithm for solving this problem to the exact optimum. Interestingly, this exact algorithm has intuitive physical interpretations, i.e., stretching the transitional parts of the trajectories (i.e., parts with acceleration and deceleration adjustments) as far as they reach the upstream end of the investigated segment, and then balancing the acceleration and deceleration magnitudes as close as possible. This analytical exact model can be considered as a core module to a range of general trajectory optimization problems at various infrastructure settings. Numerical examples reveal that this exact algorithm has much more efficient computational performance and the same or better solution quality compared with the previously proposed shooting heuristic. These examples also illustrate how to apply this model to CAV control problems on signalized segments and at non-stop intersections. Further, we study a homogeneous special case of this model and analytically formulate the relationship between queue propagation and trajectory smoothing. One counter-intuitive finding is that trajectory smoothing may not always cause longer queue propagation but instead may mitigate queue propagation with appropriate settings. This theoretical finding has valuable implications to joint optimization of queuing management and traffic smoothing in complex transportation networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, appropriate EV rebalancing operations can satisfy user reservations with limited resources and effectively save system investments. This paper proposes an integrated framework that can determine the optimal allocation plan of EVs and staff on the strategic level while considering the operational EV relocation and staff relocation decisions, in order to minimize the total cost, including the EV and staff investment, EV rebalancing and staff relocation costs. In this framework, the dispatching routes of EVs and staff are represented by two sets of space-time paths in the planning time horizon by using a space-time network representation, and the considered problem is then formulated into a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). This model explicitly considers (1) the satisfaction of time-dependent user reservations through dynamically rebalancing EVs and relocating staff to keep the service quality of carsharing system, and (2) the EV battery capacity with limited traveling distance and the charging process of EVs at parking stations. A Lagrangian relaxation-based solution approach is developed to decompose the primal problem into several sets of computationally efficient subproblems. In order to generate good-quality solutions, we also propose a three-phase implementing algorithm based on dynamic programming according to the values of Lagrangian multipliers. An illustrative numerical example and a real-world case study (based on the operation data of Seattle, WA) are conducted to verify the applicability of the formulated model and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In particular, we show that the reported computational efficiency of the MM algorithm is actually lost for large choice sets. Because the logit link that represents the parameter space in LML is intrinsically treated as a large choice set, the MM algorithm for LML actually becomes unfeasible to use in practice. We thus propose a faster MM algorithm that revisits a simple step-size correction. In a Monte Carlo study, we compare the maximum simulated likelihood estimator (MSLE) with the algorithms that we derive to estimate LML and MON-MNL models. Whereas in LML estimation alternative algorithms are computationally uncompetitive with MSLE, the faster MM algorithm appears emulous in MON-MNL estimation. Both algorithms - faster-MM and MSLE - could recover parameters as well as standard errors at a similar precision in both models. We further show that parallel computation could reduce estimation time of faster-MM by 45% to 80%. Even though faster-MM could not surpass MSLE with analytical gradient (because MSLE also leveraged similar computational gains), parallel faster-MM is a competitive replacement to MSLE for MON-MNL that obviates computation of complex analytical gradients, which is a very attractive feature to integrate it into a flexible estimation software. We also compare different algorithms in an empirical application to estimate consumer's willingness to adopt electric motorcycles in Solo, Indonesia. The results of the empirical application are consistent with those of the Monte Carlo study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The operations of individual Metroplex airports are highly interdependent, rendering their efficient management rather difficult. This paper proposes a framework for the design of dynamic arrival and departure routes in MAS Terminal Maneuvering Areas, which fundamentally changes the operation in MAS airspaces for much improved efficiency when compared to the current situation. The framework consists of three components. The first presents a new procedure for characterizing dynamic arrival and departure routes based on the spatio-temporal distributions of flights. The second component is a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model for the prioritization of the dynamic routes, which takes into account a set of quantitative and qualitative attributes important for MAS operations. The third component is a priority based method for the positioning of terminal waypoints as well as the design of three-dimensional, conflict-free terminal routes. Such a method accounts for the AHP-derived priorities while satisfying the minimal separation and aircraft maneuverability constraints. The developed framework is applied to a case study of the New York Metroplex, using aircraft trajectories during a heavy traffic period on typical day of operation in the New York Terminal Control Area in November 2011. The proposed framework is quantitatively assessed using the AirTOp fast-time simulation model. The results suggest significant improvements of the new design over the existing one, as measured by several key performance indicators such as travel distance, travel time, fuel burn, and controller workload. The operational feasibility of the framework is further validated qualitatively by subject matter experts from the Port Authority of New York and New jersey, the operator of the New York Metroplex.

The early papers on the model circumvented this complication by making approximating assumptions, but without solution of the proper model it is unclear how accurate the results are. More recent work has either considered special cases that can be solved analytically using familiar methods, or has turned to generic computational solution. This paper develops a customized method for computational solution of equilibrium in the basic bathtub model with smooth preferences that exploits the mathematical structure of the problem. An inner loop solves numerically for the entry rate, conditional on the equilibrium utility level, by verifying a trip distance condition. An outer loop uses the computed start time from the inner loop to solve for the population that commutes over the rush hour, then lowers the equilibrium utility level to repeat the inner loop for a new level of utility. One result in that, even though tastes and the congestion technology are smooth, the entry rate and exit rate functions exhibit discontinuities at breakpoints. Another result is that, depending on the form of tastes and the congestion technology, the user cost curve as a function of population and may be backward bending.

Materials and methods: NVAF patients initiating apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin were selected from the OptumInsight Research Database from January 1, 2013-September 30, 2015. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between apixaban and each oral anticoagulant. Cox models were used to estimate the risk of stroke/SE and major bleeding. Generalized linear and 2-part models were used to compare healthcare costs. Results: Of the 47,634 eligible patients, 8,328 warfarin-apixaban pairs, 3,557 dabigatran-apixaban pairs, and 8,440 rivaroxaban-apixaban pairs were matched.

Warfarin patients had significantly higher major bleeding-related and total all-cause healthcare costs compared to apixaban patients. Rivaroxaban patients had significantly higher major bleeding-related costs compared to apixaban patients. No significant results were found for the remaining comparisons. Limitations: No causal relationships can be concluded, and unobserved confounders may exist in this retrospective database analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a significantly higher risk of hospitalization (all-cause, stroke/SE, and major bleeding) associated with warfarin, a significantly higher risk of major bleeding hospitalization associated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban, and a significantly higher risk of all-cause hospitalization associated with rivaroxaban compared to apixaban. Lower major bleeding-related costs were observed for apixaban patients compared to warfarin and rivaroxaban patients.","[Amin, Alpesh] Univ Calif Irvine, UCIMC, 101 City Dr South, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Keshishian, Allison; Zhang, Qisu] STATinMED Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Vo, Lien; Patel, Chad] Bristol Myers Squibb, Lawrence, NJ USA; [Dina, Oluwaseyi; Odell, Kevin; Trocio, Jeffrey] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,"Amin, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Calif Irvine, UCIMC, 101 City Dr South, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",anamin@uci.edu,,,"Pfizer, Inc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","This work was funded by Pfizer, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb.",,54,17,18,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of sequential treatment regimens for mRCC and associated adverse events (AEs) from the Chinese payers' perspective. Methods: Key inputs included in the calculation were patient population, dosing information, incidence rates and associated costs of Grade 3/4 AEs, treatment costs (including drug discount programs), and patients' progression-free survival (PFS) as a proxy for length of treatment. To calculate PFS, this study identified pivotal clinical trials and generated a reconstructed individual patient data set from the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The median PFS from the pooled estimates were used in the calculation. In the base-case scenario, sunitinib was used as first line and the other three therapies were used as second line. Sensitivity analyses were conducted where (1) sorafenib was used as first line, or (2) a third-line therapy was added to the base-case scenario. Results: In the base case, the cost per patient per treatment month (PPPM) cost was the lowest for sunitinib + axitinib among all sequential regimens ( yen 14,898) and was the highest for sunitinib + sorafenib ( yen 20,103). If sorafenib is used as first line, everolimus had lower per patient per months (PPPM) cost than axitinib ( yen 17,046 vs yen 23,337), but also had shorter PFS (13.5 months vs 15 months). Second sensitivity analysis with an additional third-line therapy showed consistent results with the base-case scenario; axitinib as second line was the least costly. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, for mRCC sequential treatment, sunitinib followed by axitinib generates the highest cost savings from the Chinese payers' perspective. Future studies are warranted to examine the cost-effectiveness of various mRCC treatment regimens in Chinese populations.","[Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Dept Urol, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Dept Oncol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Park, Sang Hee; Xue, Mei; Gao, Xin] Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ren, Hongye] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Dong, Peng] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Pharmerit North America LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Gao, X (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåPharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",cgao@pharmerit.com,"lu, xl/HDO-8340-2022; Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013",,"Pfizer, Inc.","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was funded by Pfizer, Inc.",,51,14,17,5,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Increasing adoption and improved predictive abilities of Traveler Information Systems (TIS) enable commuters to plan their trips; however, there are inherent heterogeneities in information access and TIS accuracies. Our work addresses the open problem posed in Arnott et al. (1991) about the need to consider asymmetrically informed commuters in the bottleneck model of traffic congestion. We consider a Bayesian game with two heterogeneous commuter populations: one population is privately informed of the realized network state while the other only knows the public information about the distribution of states. We characterize the equilibrium of the game, in which each population chooses a departure rate function over time to minimize its expected cost based on its private belief about the state and the behavior of the other population. We provide a full equilibrium characterization for the complete range of values of link reliability, incident probability, and information penetration. The populations' equilibrium strategies can broadly be categorized into two distinct regimes. Specifically, when information penetration is above a certain threshold, the populations' equilibrium strategies are non-unique, and the relative Value of Information (VoI) is 0, i.e. the two populations face the same cost. On the other hand, when information penetration is below the threshold, equilibrium is unique, and Vol is positive and decreasing in information penetration. Importantly, we find that the lowest social cost is always achieved when a non-zero fraction of commuters are uninformed. The more unreliable the link, the higher the information penetration that achieves this minimum. We define the Value of Heterogeneity (VoH) as the difference between the minimum social cost and the cost under complete information penetration, and find that it can be significant under practically relevant conditions.
