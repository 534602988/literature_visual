The Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University developed a risk assessment framework and evaluated the likelihood of one or more foreign oil disruptions over the next ten years. Leading geopolitical, military and oil-market experts provided their expertise on the probability of different events occurring, and their corresponding link to major disruptions in key oil market regions. The study evaluated 5 primary regions of production: Saudi Arabia, Other Persian Gulf, Africa, Latin America, and Russian / Caspian States. Disruptions are defined as being net of offsets (e.g., OPEC spare capacity), with the notable exception that the SPR is not included as a source of offsets. At least once during the 10-year time frame (2016-2025), there exists approximately an 80% probability of a net (of offsets) disruption of 2 MMBD (million barrels per day) or more lasting at least 1 month.","[Beccue, Phillip C.] White Deer Partners, 2228 Knollcrest Pl, Westlake Village, CA 91361 USA; [Huntington, Hillard G.] Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Leiby, Paul N.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Vincent, Kenneth R.] US DOE, 1000 Independence Ave, Washington, DC 20585 USA",Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE),"Huntington, HG (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",phil@whitedeerpartners.com; hillh@stanford.edu; leibypn@ornl.gov; Kenneth.Vincent@hq.doe.gov,,,,,,,26,18,19,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,456,469,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.013,0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428099800045,0

This paper studies the impact of workplace charges on the adoption of two types of PEVs: battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in electric vehicle (PHEV). BEV users care more about the range anxiety issue. PHEV users, on the other hand, focus on the cost savings. The GPS-based longitude travel data of 143 vehicles covering 20 days to 18 months were employed in this paper. The dataset provides the detailed spatial and temporal travel information of a vehicle. With the known household locations, home-to-home tours were built for each vehicle, because home charges is usually regarded as a basic charging pattern. The detailed travel information of each vehicle was further used to help determine the workplace locations by analyzing its travel behavior over a period. Then, some home-to-home tours were broken into a series of home-to-work, work-to home and work-to-work (if applicable) tours. These tours were used for analyzing the impact of workplace charges on the adoption of BEVs and PHEVs in population, respectively, considering three different levels of charger powers, as well as different price of gasoline.","[Wu, Xing] Lamar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 10024, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA",Texas State University System; Lamar University,"Wu, X (通讯作者)，Lamar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 10024, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA.",xing.wu@lamar.edu,"Wu, Xing/O-6117-2016","Wu, Xing/0000-0002-0514-3292",Oak Ridge National Laboratory [237130],Oak Ridge National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),The author appreciates the comments and suggestions from three anonymous reviewers.

This literature finds that using a larger-than-usual truncation parameter to estimate the long-run variance, combined with Kiefer-Vogelsang (2002, 2005) fixed-b critical values, can substantially reduce size distortions, at only a modest cost in (size-adjusted) power. Empirical practice, however, has not kept up. This article therefore draws on the post-Newey West/Andrews literature to make concrete recommendations for HAR inference. We derive truncation parameter rules that choose a point on the size-power tradeoff to minimize a loss function. If Newey-West tests are used, we recommend the truncation parameter rule S = 1.3T(1/2) and (nonstandard) fixed-b critical values. For tests of a single restriction, we find advantages to using the equal-weighted cosine (EWC) test, where the long run variance is estimated by projections onto Type II cosines, using = 0.4T(2/3) cosine terms; for this test, fixed-b critical values are, conveniently, t or F. We assess these rules using first an ARMA/GARCH Monte Carlo design, then a dynamic factor model design estimated using a 207 quarterly U.S. macroeconomic time series.","[Lazarus, Eben] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lewis, Daniel J.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Stock, James H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stock, James H.; Watson, Mark W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Lazarus, E (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",elazarus@mit.edu; daniel.lewis@ny.frb.org; james_stock@harvard.edu; mwatson@princeton.edu,,"Lewis, Daniel/0009-0007-3161-3474",,,,,44,66,74,1,11,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Using the 2014-2015 ACCESS survey with over 8500 households from six energy-poor Indian states, our study reports on results from a comprehensive survey of LPG use in rural India using a holistic approach to understanding the integration of a clean cooking fuel into rural household's energy mixes. There are three principal findings: (i) fuel costs are a critical obstacle to widespread adoption, (ii) fuel stacking is the prevailing norm as few households stop using firewood when adopting LPG, and (iii) both users and non-users have highly positive views of LPG as a convenient and clean cooking fuel. These findings show that expanding LPG use offers great promise in rural India, but affordability prevents a complete transition from traditional biomass to clean cooking fuels.","[Gould, Carlos F.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,"Gould, Carlos F/HKO-7881-2023","Gould, Carlos/0000-0002-7736-3905",National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant [R25GM62454],National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This work was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant #R25GM62454 to CFG.

Using bounding scenarios of attributional lifecycle analysis, this study finds that the climate impacts of United States exports to China, Japan, India, or South Korea could vary significantly, with annual global lifecycle emissions ranging from -88,000 metric tons CO(2)e to + 170,000 metric tons CO(2)e per Bcf of exports. Exact emissions will depend on factors such as (a) the final end-use of the LNG, (b) domestic market impacts from increased natural gas prices in the United States, (c) induced additional energy consumption in importing countries, and (d) methane leakage rates. Country specific greenhouse gas outcomes can differ from global outcomes, with major implications for extraction and consumption based emissions accounting. The study's results indicate the need for more robust consideration of the climate impacts of all energy exports in terms of country specific energy analyses, global climate regulations, and market uncertainty. Thus, how gas is governed becomes of critical importance, for it will determine whether LNG is a net sink or source of additional emissions.","[Gilbert, Alexander Q.] Spark Lib, Washington, DC USA; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aarhus University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",alexgilbert@sparklibrary.com; BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Gilbert, Alexander/0000-0001-7906-6106",,,,,43,10,11,2,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,635,643,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063,0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000440123300059,0

In this paper we investigate both the temporal and spatial dynamics of formative phases by which energy technologies prepare for growth. Drawing on a review of diverse literatures, we offer a definition of the formative phase which clarifies its scope and duration, and identifies its main technological and economic determinants. We use parametric hazard models to assess the relative strengths of these determinants on formative phase durations for a sample of 15 energy technologies diffusing over time in their respective initial markets. We find that substitutability has stronger effects in accelerating the end of formative phases than installed capacity and prices. We extend our analysis using nonparametric models to analyze the spatial diffusion of formative phase durations from initial to follower markets. We find that formative phase durations are long outside initial markets as well, showing only signs of acceleration in latecomer regions. Our results imply risks for policies trying to accelerate the diffusion of large innovations without ready markets in both initial and follower markets.","[Bento, Nuno] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bento, Nuno] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Charlie] UEA, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wilson, Charlie] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Ctr Environm Energy & Nat Resource Governance, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Harvard University; University of East Anglia; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Cambridge,"Bento, N (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",Nuno.Bento@iscte.pt,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011","Bento, Nuno/0000-0002-5923-0666; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BPD/91183/2012]; European Union [730403 - INNOPATHS],International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research on which this article is based was supported by a grant from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and Harvard Kennedy School.

After reviewing the rationales for conducting such projects and providing partial public funding for them, five assessment criteria derived from the literature are applied to the portfolio, pertaining to project selection and termination, cost-sharing, partnerships, information-sharing, and the environment for follow-on investment. The assessment is mixed. DOE performed best, relative to expectations, on project selection and termination and partnerships, and not as well on cost-sharing, information-sharing, and the follow-on environment. This performance does not warrant establishing a new agency to replace DOE for management of demonstration projects. The recommendations include implementing cost-sharing more flexibly, making information-sharing a higher priority, avoiding too-rapid scale-up of technologies, and being explicit about project milestones and considering termination if they are not met.","[Hart, David M.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Hart, DM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",dilart@gmu.edu,,,Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation provided in-kind support in the preparation of this paper.,,44,10,10,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,367,376,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.047,0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000439671200034,0

Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.","[Lilliestam, Johan; Hanger, Susanne; Komendantova, Nadejda; Patt, Anthony] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lilliestam, Johan] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Barradi, Touria] MENARES, Casablanca, Morocco; [Caldes, Natalia] CIEMAT, Energy Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Gomez, Marta] Dow Chem, Tarragona, Spain; [Kern, Jurgen] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, Stuttgart, Germany; [Mehos, Mark] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Thermal Syst Grp, Golden, CO USA; [Hong, Wai Mun] Univ Autonoma Madrid, MERIGG, Madrid, Spain; [Wang, Zhifeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Autonomous University of Madrid; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Electrical Engineering, CAS","Lilliestam, J (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",johan.lilliestam@usys.ethz.ch,"Komendantova, Nadejda/AAI-1536-2021","Komendantova, Nadejda/0000-0003-2568-6179; Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991; Patt, Anthony/0000-0001-8428-8707",European Research Council [313553]; European Research Council (ERC) [313553] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This paper is based on a workshop held in Abu Dhabi in October 2016, to which all authors attended.

The energy extraction boom has had many localized impacts, most notably in areas with substantial shale gas reserves. This paper exploits a natural experiment in the Marcellus region to examine one channel of the so-called resource curse, the effect of resource extraction on local crime. The results show that areas experiencing a natural gas extraction boom suffer an increase in overall violent crimes, while property crimes remain similar to non-boom areas. Furthermore, the violent crime increase appears to be driven primarily by increases in aggravated and sexual assaults.","[Komarek, Timothy M.] Old Dominion Univ, 2023 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Komarek, TM (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, 2023 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",tkomarek@odu.edu,,,,,,,50,32,42,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The basic idea is to conduct the standard GMM estimation combined with two penalty terms: the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage and the quadratic regularization. It is a one-step procedure of valid moment condition selection, nonzero structural parameter selection (i.e., model selection), and consistent estimation of the nonzero parameters. The procedure achieves the standard GMM efficiency bound as if we know the valid moment conditions ex ante, for which the quadratic regularization is important. We also study the tuning parameter choice, with which we show that selection consistency still holds without assuming Gaussianity. We apply the new estimation procedure to dynamic panel data models, where both the time and cross-section dimensions are large. The new estimator is robust to possible serial correlations in the regression error terms.","[Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Han, Xu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; City University of Hong Kong; Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.;Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.",caner.12@osu.edu; xuhan25@cityu.edu.hk; ylee41@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Lee, Yoonseok/0000-0002-8379-0700",,,,,26,13,14,1,12,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Our proposed models draw on successful ideas from the literature on modeling high-dimensional covariance matrices and on recent work on models for general time-varying distributions. Our use of copula-based models enables the estimation of the joint model in stages, greatly reducing the computational burden. We use the proposed new models to study a collection of daily credit default swap (CDS) spreads on 100 U.S. firms over the period 2006 to 2012. We find that while the probability of distress for individual firms has greatly reduced since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the joint probability of distress (a measure of systemic risk) is substantially higher now than in the precrisis period.

We constructed a summary index by summing the points scored on the five items. The mean score for the biofuels knowledge index was 2.25 +/- 3.33 on the scale of - 10 to + 10 points. The multiple regression results showed that socio-demographic attributes are significant predictors of biofuels knowledge: men scored 1.65 points higher than women; for one level increment in education, respondents scored 0.26 points higher; and Democrats scored 1.34 points lower than others.

Regression analysis of principal component scores is applied to identify geographic and administrative status patterns in the sources of the growth. The analysis suggests that shifts in labor supply largely were responsible for the regional growth differences over the period, though shifts in labor demand were nearly equally as important.

Social enterprises sit within the third sector of the economy, typically where market or governmental failures exist in the provision of social welfare, and have increasingly become a key driver of social progress. The autonomous nature of the social-economic model applied by such organisations can represent a viable means to reduce state social welfare dependence, and is a proven model for social change. The capability of social enterprises to create both social and economic value is considered a 'win-win'. Yet there are clear potentials for social enterprise models to be more extensively applied to address contemporary ecological challenges of neo-liberal market economies, moving towards 'win-win-win' outcomes across social, economic and ecological domains. This paper investigates the value of social enterprises as drivers of low-carbon transition at the community level, with an emphasis on the energy sector. Evidence from seven organisations in the UK is presented and a socio-technical transitions conceptual framework is applied to analyse these social enterprise operations as a form of social innovation.","[Hillman, Joanne; Axon, Stephen; Morrissey, John] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Axon, Stephen] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Morrissey, John] Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland",Liverpool John Moores University; Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; University of Limerick,"Morrissey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland.",J.s.Hillman@2012.ljmu.ac.uk; S.J.Axon@ljmu.ac.uk; john.morrissey@mic.ul.ie,,"Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118",European Union [657998]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [657998] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This paper has been developed from research conducted as part of the ENTRUST project, funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 657998.

These developments suggest somewhat lower security costs may be associated with U.S. oil consumption. This analysis provides updated estimates of the security premiums for U.S. consumption of imported oil, U.S. consumption of domestically produced oil, and the substitution of imported oil for domestically produced oil. Estimates of the expected security costs of U.S. oil consumption are provided over the time horizon from 2015 to 2040, while taking into account projected world oil market conditions, the probabilities and sizes of world oil supply disruptions, the response of world oil prices to those supply disruptions, and the response of U.S. real GDP to those oil price shocks. The estimated oil security premiums suggest that U.S. oil security has become less of a policy concern.","[Brown, Stephen P.

This comprehensive weatherization program provides grants to U.S. states, which then provide grants to local weatherization agencies to weatherize income-eligible low-income homes. The program treats single family and mobile homes, and multifamily buildings in all climate zones. The impact evaluations focused on Program Years (PYs) 2008 and 2010. The latter fell during the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) period. The program supported the weatherization of 98,000 units in PY 2008 and 332,000 units in PY 2010. It is estimated that the program saved 2.3 trillion Btus in PY 2008 and 7.6 trillion Btus in PY 2010. These savings achieve $420 million in energy cost savings with respect to PY 2008 and $1.2 billion in savings in PY 2010. Environmental and health and household related benefits add $267 million and $1.2 billion and $694 million and $3.8 billion of co-benefits to the energy cost savings benefits. The average total benefit per unit weatherized in PY 2008 is $22,000 versus an average total cost of $4,700. These results for PY 2010 are $20,000 and $6,800, respectively.","[Tonn, B.; Rose, E.; Hawkins, B.] Three3 Inc, 520 W,Summit Hill Dr,Suite 1101, Knoxville, TN 37902 USA",,"Tonn, B (通讯作者)，Three3 Inc, 520 W,Summit Hill Dr,Suite 1101, Knoxville, TN 37902 USA.",btonn@threecubed.org; erose@threecubed.org; bhawkins@threecubed.org,,,"Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs, U.S. Department of Energy; WAP Grantees and Subgrantees; APPRISE, Inc.; Michael Blasnik of Nest Labs; Seventhwave","Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs, U.S. Department of Energy; WAP Grantees and Subgrantees; APPRISE, Inc.; Michael Blasnik of Nest Labs; Seventhwave","This research was supported by the Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs, U.S. Department of Energy.

Consequently, DMUs are likely to experience substantial differences in productivity and efficiency levels. In contrast, the received literature assumes that DMUs share similar technological possibilities and only differ with respect to their level of inefficiency. This study develops an analytical framework using random parameters, which accommodates heterogeneity in production possibilities and in characteristics of the production environment. We use this framework to analyze variations in the output elasticity of irrigation across DMUs, and how these differences influence: 1) irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), using a non-radial input-oriented approach that isolates and measures the efficient use of the irrigation input; 2) technical efficiency, which radially measures the efficient utilization of all inputs; and 3) shadow prices of irrigation withdrawals. We find that IWUE and technical efficiency averaged 72.6% and 83.6%, respectively, and shadow prices averaged $77.5 per million gallons of irrigation water, albeit with significant regional variations.","[Njuki, Eric; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca, Chile",University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca,"Njuki, E (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",eric.njuki@uconn.edu; boris.bravoureta@uconn.edu,,"Njuki, Eric/0000-0002-1000-4609","National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-67012-24678, 2016-67024-24760]",National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This study was support by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant # 2016-67012-24678 (EN) and Grant # 2016-67024-24760 (BBU).

In particular, a series of major events in the 1970s led most states in the US to look for partial alternatives to fossil fuels for electricity generation. We notably observe changes for 26 states between the years 1968 and 1980. Starting with the premise that a more diversified grid mix is preferable from a robustness viewpoint, and by using 2015 data, we then evaluate the response of all states under multiple energy source disruption scenarios and detect three different classes of states: vulnerable (10 states), moderately robust (17 states), and robust (23 states). Expectedly, some states are particularly vulnerable as they depend predominantly on a single energy source (e.g., West Virginia with 95% coal usage). In contrast, we find seven states (i.e., South Dakota, Illinois, Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, New York, and New Jersey) that have particularly robust energy mix, while having fossil fuel shares below 50% in 2015.","[Ahmad, Nasir; Derrible, Sybil] Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks CSUN Lab, Engn Res Facil 2095, 842 W Taylor St,M-C 246, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Ahmad, N (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks CSUN Lab, Engn Res Facil 2095, 842 W Taylor St,M-C 246, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",sahmad38@uic.edu; derrible@uic.edu,,"Derrible, Sybil/0000-0002-2939-6016; Ahmad, Nasir/0000-0001-5067-7368","National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award [CCF-1331800]; NSF CAREER Award [1551731]; NSF CPS Award [1646395]; Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1646395] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1551731] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1331800] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award; NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF CPS Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award CCF-1331800, the NSF CAREER Award 1551731, the NSF CPS Award 1646395, and by the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",,45,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,167,174,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.035,0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000440123300016,0

Instead, the biofuel use mandate is the primary existing GHG reduction program in the United States. The mandate effectively requires a rising amount of GHG abatement each year, but allows regulated parties to buy and sell credits to meet annual obligations. Although many aspects of the biofuel mandate look similar to a cap-and-trade program, there are additional requirements, such as feedstock eligibility limitations and waivers. The existence of the mandates is presumably conditional on all the legal requirements, but these conditions represent a departure from a strict GHG cap-and-trade program. We estimate GHG abatement costs of the mandate and compare them to a hypothetical cap-and-trade program targeting vehicle fuels. The mandate abatement cost is found to be higher than a hypothetical GHG cap-and-trade. Our results show that the RFS might be judged as a feasible substitute for a cap-and-trade regime that can deliver GHG reductions, but at a higher cost reflecting its multiple objectives.","[Thompson, Wyatt; Whistance, Jarrett] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, Columbia, MO 65203 USA; [Thompson, Wyatt; Whistance, Jarrett] Univ Missouri, Food & Agr Policy Res Inst, Columbia, MO 65203 USA; [Johansson, Robert] USDA, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Meyer, Seth] USDA, World Agr Outlook Board, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Thompson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, 101 Pk DeVille Dr,Suite E, Columbia, MO 65203 USA.",thompsonw@missouri.edu,,,"United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [58-0111-15-021]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [MO-HASS0024]","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project","This work is supported by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) cooperative agreement number 58-0111-15-021, and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project number MO-HASS0024, but findings and views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of USDA or the University of Missouri.",,42,10,11,3,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,368,375,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.041,0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000423009500036,0

A Wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution underlying the Logit model is rejected at the 0.01 level in favor of the ML-MPD distribution model. Our results also demonstrate the potential for substantially overstating the precision of the estimates and associated inferences when the imposition of unknown structural information is not accounted explicitly for in the model.

Microgrids can significantly reduce the cost of providing basic electrification and may also be scaled up to provide higher levels of services efficiently through energy and cost sharing. A census of 6 off-grid villages highlights the demand for electrification. On average household report a willingness to pay of USD 1.78 per month for the provision of high quality lighting and USD 3.24 per month for the addition of a fan. Furthermore, households are willing to pay an additional USD 0.89 per month for a communal load. First order cost calculations show that this demand can be met through the use of various solar topologies, in particular decentralised microgrids by local entrepreneurs with suitable public sector subsidies.

Various cross-comparisons among product features and use-phase behaviors have been made and the most important predictors of the residential electricity consumption based on the data have been introduced. Product-level and user-level discussions on the findings have also been provided.","[Mashhadi, Ardeshir Raihanian] SUNY Buffalo, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Buffalo, NY USA; [Behdad, Sara] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Behdad, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",ardeshir@buffalo.edu; sarabehd@buffalo.edu,,,National Science Foundation-USA [CBET-1705621],National Science Foundation-USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation-USA under grant number CBET-1705621.

If one of these energy sources offshore wind becomes a common sight off coastlines, consideration of local public opinion and action will be critical. Previous research from the social sciences has lacked depth in examining the underlying factors that shape public opinion towards offshore wind development. The current research brings a new perspective to the literature by showing that how members of the public perceive support among others relates to their own opinions of offshore wind energy. We report results from two surveys. The first focused on opinion formation relating to offshore wind in general among New England residents, while the second focused on a specific offshore wind project in Rhode Island. We find evidence that both supporters and opponents of offshore wind underestimate levels of support among others, indicating a pluralistic ignorance effect and false consensus effect, respectively. We also find distinct patterns of perceived support among self-identified Republicans and Democrats. The findings hold important implications for policymakers and developers in understanding the nature of public support and opposition for offshore wind energy, particularly with respect to individuals' willingness to publicly engage with offshore wind projects.","[Sokoloski, Rebecca; Markowitz, Ezra M.] Univ Massachusetts, Environm Conservat Dept, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bidwell, David] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affairs, 1 Greenhouse Rd,Suite 209, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Rhode Island,"Sokoloski, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Environm Conservat Dept, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rsokoloski@umass.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project [1007596]; NIFA [1007596, 812914] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project 1007596.

Scenario analyses and case study were applied to illustrate the results, which show five basic conclusions. 1) Low-carbon development doesn't require eliminating energy consumption completely during urbanization 2) The average level of urbanization is relatively low owing to the large disparities among provinces and the provinces' economic development. Though the development of low-carbon in the 30 provinces is generally rapid, the gap between the highest provinces and the lowest provinces is relatively large because of their different socio-economic features. 3) Much more attention should be paid to CO2 emissions per capita. The quality of public social service,the basic and medical insurance coverage for the elderly, the community service coverage in infrastructure and the green design during urban construction should be improved. 4) The coordination of CUS is closely related to the different development stages and geographic locations of each province. 5) For different types of provinces with different degrees of coupling coordination,there is a need to explore different development directions.","[Song, Qijiao; Liu, Tianle; Qi, Ye] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Song, Qijiao] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Management, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Nan; Siehr, Stephanie A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Dept, China Energy Grp, Berkeley, CA USA; [Siehr, Stephanie A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Tsinghua University; Capital Normal University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Qi, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qi@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tianle/0000-0003-4995-8781",,,,,15,166,171,60,329,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,346,354,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.037,0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-08,WOS:000445983800035,0

Empirical studies show that carbon pricing can successfully incentivise incremental emissions reductions. But meeting temperature targets within defined timelines as agreed under the Paris Agreement requires more than incremental improvements: it requires achieving net zero emissions within a few decades. To date, there is little evidence that carbon pricing has produced deep emission reductions, even at high prices. While much steeper carbon prices may deliver greater abatement, political economy constraints render their feasibility doubtful. An approach with multiple instruments, including technology mandates and targeted support for innovation, is indispensable to avoid path dependencies and lock-in of long-lived, high-carbon assets. We argue that carbon pricing serves several important purposes in such an instrument mix, but also that the global commitment to deep decarbonisation requires acknowledging the vital role of instruments other than carbon pricing.","[Tvinnereim, Endre] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Mehling, Michael] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Tvinnereim, E (通讯作者)，Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",endre.tvinnereim@uni.no; mmehling@mit.edu,"Tvinnereim, Endre/AFQ-8791-2022","Tvinnereim, Endre/0000-0001-8891-2503","Research Council of Norway [261603, 268056]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We acknowledge funding from the Research Council of Norway, grants no. 261603 and 268056.

A common shortcoming of most of the previous studies has been a proper accounting of Lithium-ion battery degradation in the development of business models. Very recently, papers on the viability of V2G were published for which the detailed account of battery degradation resulted in what appeared to be two ostensibly contradictory conclusions. In this paper, the authors of these two major studies jointly reconcile their previous conclusions by providing clarity on how methodologies to manage battery degradation can reliably extend battery life.

This article presents a new econometric framework for estimation of affine Gaussian DTSMs under restrictions on risk prices, which addresses the issues of a large model space and of model uncertainty using a Bayesian approach. A simulation study demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method. Data for U.S.Treasury yields calls for tight restrictions on risk pricing: only level risk is priced, and only changes in the slope affect term premia. Incorporating the restrictions changes the model-implied short-rate expectations and term premia. Interest rate persistence is higher than in a maximally flexible model, hence expectations of future short rates are more variablerestrictions on risk prices help resolve the puzzle of implausibly stable short-rate expectations in this literature. Consistent with survey evidence and conventional macro wisdom, restricted models attribute a large share of the secular decline in long-term interest rates to expectations of future nominal short rates.

It examines the utility's industrial rebate programs for lighting, motor, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and estimates the economic and environmental impacts of the programs using an input-output modeling framework. All three rebate programs provided a modest economic boost not only to directly involved equipment manufacturers and marketing service providers, but also to other upstream industries responding to the direct impact and the final demand augmented by the associated increase in value added in the regional economy.

Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests.

Scenarios that do or do not comply with the carbon pollution standards based on the U.S. New Source Performance Standards and Clean Power Plan are evaluated. Using the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region as an illustration, the scenarios with carbon regulations are shown to have lower CO2 emissions and water use from the power sector than the continuation of the status quo with more electricity generation from coal than natural gas. The benefits are due to increases in electricity generation from renewable sources and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants plus retirements of existing coal-fired plants, which depend on natural gas and CO2 allowance prices. When CO2 is captured and sold for enhanced oil recovery with a price higher than $15 per short ton, water consumption is elevated because of more electricity generation from existing NGCC plants retrofitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. A stringent constraint on water withdrawals decreases electricity generation from existing power plants with once-through cooling, but increases overall water consumption because of an elevated share of plants with wet recirculating cooling systems in the fleet.","[Lim-Wavde, Kustini; Kauffman, Robert J.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Zhai, Haibo; Rubin, Edward S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Singapore Management University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Zhai, HB (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hbzhai@cmu.edu,"Zhai, Haibo/L-8201-2019; Rubin, Edward S/D-7629-2013; KAUFFMAN, Robert J/G-2767-2012","Zhai, Haibo/0000-0001-8585-9559; Lim-Wavde, Kustini/0000-0003-0726-3826","Singapore Management University (SMU); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Singapore Management University (SMU); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)","Singapore Management University (SMU)(Singapore Management University); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Singapore Management University (SMU)(Singapore Management University); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)","This work was supported by the Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), a joint research initiative between Singapore Management University (SMU) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

It discusses the prospects in countries that have never deployed nuclear power before but have expressed an interest in adding it to their future national energy mixes. Many of these newcomer countries are considering small modular reactor (SMR) designs which hold promise for fitting better into their local electricity systems. Thus, the article considers the technical attributes of these designs and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of SMRs with an emphasis on economics, grid compatibility and most importantly, safety. Attributes of a safety culture are discussed from social and cultural aspects, including topics of good governance and the presence of an independent national regulatory authority. Beyond the need for strong national safety regulations, the article also highlights the need to strengthen the international regulatory regime, if nuclear power is to succeed in achieving the highest levels of safety globally. Finally, the qualities of such a regime are discussed.","[Budnitz, Robert J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rogner, H-Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2236 Laxenburg, Austria; [Shihab-Eldin, Adnan] Kuwait Fdn Adv Sci, Kuwait 25253, Kuwait",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Budnitz, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",budnitz@pacbell.net; holger.rogner@gmail.com; adnan.shihabeldin@gmail.com,,,World Federation of Scientists,World Federation of Scientists,"This work was developed initially as two lectures and a follow-on paper as a contribution to the 50th Session of the International Seminars on Planetary Emergencies in Erice, Italy (August 2017), a forum sponsored by and supported by the World Federation of Scientists.

In this paper, we evaluate the effect of these incentives on the adoption of electric vehicles. We find that every $1000 offered as a rebate or tax credit increases average sales of electric vehicles by 2.6%. We also find that HOV lane access is a significant contributor to adoption, the effect is a 4.7% increase corresponding to density of HOV lanes (every 100 vehicles per hour). In addition, we introduce a novel variable to capture consumer knowledge of EVs and associated incentives in our model to help explain the state level heterogeneity in response to incentives and find that raising consumer awareness is critical to the success of EV incentive programs.","[Jenn, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Springel, Katalin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gopal, Anand R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Int Energy Studies Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Jenn, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ajenn@ucdavis.edu,,"Jenn, Alan/0000-0003-4232-0697","Office of International Affairs, U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of International Affairs, U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank Jeff Kessler and his work on the consumer knowledge proxy using the Stanford Natural Language Processor.

Heuristics from the literature put policy makers in a dilemma between addressing a market failure and acknowledging a govemment failure: incentives for private investments in large scale demonstrations are weak (the valley of death) but the track record of governance in large demonstration projects is poor (the technology pork barrel). These arguments are reassessed in the literature, particularly as to how they apply to supporting demonstration projects for decarbonizing industry. A new data set is built of 511 demonstration projects in nine technology areas and characteristics for each project are coded, including timing, motivations, scale, and the share of public funding. The literature and the results from the case studies have five main implications for policy makers in making decisions about demonstration support. Policy makers should consider: prioritizing learning, iteratively upscaling, engaging the private sector, disseminating knowledge widely, and making demand pull robust.","[Nemet, Gregory F.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zipperer, Vera; Kraus, Martina] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Nemet, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nemet@wisc.edu,"Nemet, Gregory/B-3422-2008","Nemet, Gregory/0000-0001-7859-4580",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [03MAP316],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy,"We are grateful for funding from German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy contract #03MAP316.

Limited flexibility can result from thermal and hydro plants that cannot turn off or reduce output due to technical or economic limits. These limits include the operating range of conventional thermal power plants, the need for process heat from combined heat and power plants, and restrictions on hydro unit operation. To appropriately analyze regional and national energy policies related to renewable deployment, these limits must be accurately captured in grid planning models. In this work, we summarize data sources and methods for U.S. power plants that can be used to capture minimum generation levels in grid planning tools, such as production cost models. We also provide case studies for two locations in the U.S. (California and Texas) that demonstrate the sensitivity of variable generation (VG) curtailment to grid flexibility assumptions which shows the importance of analyzing (and documenting) minimum generation levels in studies of increased VG penetration.","[Denholm, Paul; Brinkman, Greg; Mai, Trieu] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Denholm, P (通讯作者)，Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",Paul.denholm@nrel.gov; gregory.brinkman@nrel.gov; trieu.mai@nrel.gov,,,U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [DE-AC36-08GO28308],U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors thank Michael Rossol and Rajaraman Padmanabhan for assistance with CEMS data.

We estimate the parameters by nonlinear generalized method of moments and find that habit formation is an important determinant of household food-consumption patterns.

Using an expanded kaya identity framework, we model vehicle stock, energy intensity, and vehicle miles traveled, progressively considering the effects of each of these three disruptions. We find that electricity use from light duty vehicle transport will likely be in the 570-1140 TWh range, 13-26%, respectively, of total electricity demand in 2050. Depending on the pace at which the electric sector decarbonizes, this increase in electric demand could correspond to a decrease in LDV greenhouse gas emissions of up to 80%. In the near term, rapid and complete transport electrification with a carbon-free grid should remain the cornerstones of transport decarbonization policy. However, long-term policy should also aim to mitigate autonomous vehicles' potential to increase driving mileage, urban and suburban sprawl, and traffic congestion while incentivizing potential energy efficiency improvements through both better system management and the lightweighting of an accident-free vehicle fleet.","[Fox-Penner, Peter] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gorman, Will] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fox-Penner, Peter; Hatch, Jennifer] Boston Univ, Inst Sustainable Energy, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Boston University,"Gorman, W (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",pfoxp@bu.edu; gorman_will@berkeley.edu; hatchj@bu.edu,"Gorman, Will/U-2934-2018","Gorman, Will/0000-0003-4990-7685",Hewlett Foundation [2016-5132]; Energy Foundation; Boston University,Hewlett Foundation; Energy Foundation; Boston University,"The authors would like to thank John Paul Helveston and Henry Kelly for their insights and reviews of earlier drafts of this manuscript.

To understand the role of road transport in energy demand and emissions, five modeling teams developed baseline projections for India's transportation sector as part of inter model comparison exercise under the Sustainable Growth Working Group (SGWG) of the US-India Energy Dialog. Based on modeling results, we explore the developments in India's passenger and freight road transport, including changes in the modal shift and the resulting changes in energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions. We find significant differences in the base-year data and parameters for future projections, namely energy consumption by transport in general and by mode, service demand for passenger and freight transport.

Most of the same jurisdictions also subsidize the manufacturing and/or deployment of renewable energy technologies, some being sufficiently aggressive as to engender WTO disputes. We consider a downstream energy-using product produced competitively but not traded across regions, such as electricity or transportation. A renewable energy technology is available, provided by a limited set of upstream suppliers who exercise market power. With multiple market failures (emissions externality and imperfect competition), renewable market share mandates as the binding climate policy, and international trade in equipment, the stage is set to examine rationales for green industrial policy. Subsidies may be provided down-stream to energy suppliers and/or upstream to technology suppliers; each has tradeoffs. Subsidies can offset underprovision of the renewable alternative by the upstream suppliers, but they allow dirty generation to expand as the portfolio standard becomes less costly to fulfill. Downstream subsidies raise all upstream profits and crowd out foreign emissions. Upstream subsidies increase domestic upstream market share but expand emissions globally. In our two-region model, strategic subsidies chosen noncooperatively can be optimal from a global perspective, if both regions value emissions at the global cost of carbon. But if the regions sufficiently undervalue global emissions, restricting the use of upstream subsidies can enhance welfare.

We consider two types of intervention, first the standard case of a parameter change that does not alter the steady state, and second one that does alter the steady state, e.g. the target rate of inflation. We consider two types of test, one a multi-horizon test, where the postintervention policy horizon, H, is small and fixed, and a mean policy effect test where H is allowed to increase without bounds. The multi-horizon test requires Gaussian errors, but the mean policy effect test does not. It is shown that neither of these two tests are consistent, in the sense that the power of the tests does not tend to unity as H, unless the intervention alters the steady state. This follows directly from the fact that DSGE variables are measured as deviations from the steady state, and the effects of policy change on target variables decay exponentially fast. We investigate the size and power of the proposed mean effect test by simulating a standard three equation New Keynesian DSGE model. The simulation results are in line with our theoretical findings and show that in all applications the tests have the correct size; but unless the intervention alters the steady state, their power does not go to unity with H.","[Pesaran, M.

A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of $7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a $73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be $71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain.","[Ghani, N.

To reduce electricity consumption-related emissions effectively at the level of individual firms, it is essential that they are measured accurately and that decision-relevant information is provided to managers, consumers, regulators and investors. However, an emergent GHG accounting method for corporate electricity consumption (the 'market-based' method) fails to meet these criteria and therefore is likely to lead to a misallocation of climate change mitigation efforts. We identify two interrelated problems with the market-based method: 1. purchasing contractual emission factors is very unlikely to increase the amount of renewable electricity generation; and 2. the method fails to provide accurate or relevant information in GHG reports. We also identify reasons why the method has nonetheless been accepted by many stakeholders, and provide recommendations for the revision of international standards for GHG accounting. The case is important given the magnitude of emissions attributable to commercial/industrial electricity consumption, and it also provides broader lessons for other forms of GHG accounting.","[Brander, Matthew; Ascui, Francisco] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Business & Climate Change, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gillenwater, Michael] GHG Management Inst, Seattle, WA USA",University of Edinburgh,"Brander, M (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",Matthew.Brander@ed.ac.uk,"Ascui, Francisco/AAD-4904-2019","Ascui, Francisco/0000-0001-6036-3987",UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS); UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) through Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme [ES/L002698/1]; ESRC [ES/L002698/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L002698/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS); UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) through Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Matthew Brander would like to acknowledge the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), in partnership with the Society for the Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS) and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES), for their support through the Management and Business Development Fellowship Scheme (Grant reference: ES/L002698/1).",,35,40,42,5,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,29,33,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.051,0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000416615800005,0

Despite the existence of surplus natural gas capacity in the U.S., power system operational constraints not often considered in power sector policy analyses, such as transmission congestion, generator ramping constraints, minimum generation constraints, planned and unplanned generator outages, and ancillary service requirements, could limit the potential and increase the cost of coal-to-gas re-dispatch. Using a highly detailed power system unit commitment and dispatch model, we estimate the maximum potential for re-dispatch in the Eastern Interconnection, which accounts for the majority of coal capacity and generation in the U.S. Under our reference assumptions, we find that maximizing coal-to-gas re-dispatch yields emissions reductions of 230 million metric tons (Mt), or 13% of power sector emissions in the Eastern Interconnection, with a corresponding average abatement cost of $15-$44 per metric ton of CO2, depending on the assumed supply elasticity of natural gas.","[Steinberg, Daniel C.; Bielen, David A.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Townsend, Aaron] Elect Reliabil Council Texas, Taylor, TX USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Steinberg, DC (通讯作者)，Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",daniel.steinberg@nrel.gov,,"Steinberg, Daniel/0000-0003-1769-2261","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis","Support for this work was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis.

However, some stakeholders have raised concerns about the assumptions underlying the benefits assessments in AMI business cases. Such concerns are especially acute for certain subpopulations of residential customers. Low income, elderly and chronically ill (i.e., vulnerable) customers are believed to have less load that can be shifted or reduced to capture bill savings, lack the know-how or wherewithal with which to curtail usage, likely have more limited financial resources which may compel them to avoid high priced periods by reducing electricity for essential usage potentially causing them physical harm, and more generally may be more adversely affected by higher bills, which might possibly result from certain forms of time-based rates. There is very limited existing literature that addresses these questions specifically with regard to vulnerable subpopulations. This paper, based on a larger report, extends the existing empirical literature on the experiences of low-income customers exposed to critical peak pricing, and provides the first glimpses into the experiences of the elderly and those who reported being chronically ill.","[Cappers, Peter; Spurlock, C.

Some analysts have declared that China's coal consumption may have peaked. Preliminary data, however, indicate that coal consumption increased in 2017. To understand future near-term trends in China's coal consumption, we analyze a number of important drivers of coal use and find projected increases in electricity demand that cannot be met by other fossil-fuel or non-fossil-fuel electricity sources, as well as projected increases in coal use in light manufacturing, other non-industrial sectors, and for transformation. We find that these projected increases will lead to near-term growth in China's coal use to levels of approximately 2900 Mtce to 3050 Mtce in 2020, with associated increases in energy-related CO2 emissions.","[Lin, Jiang; Fridley, David; Lu, Hongyou; Price, Lynn; Zhou, Nan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mailstop 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Lin, J (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,Mailstop 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94702 USA.",j_lin@lbl.gov,"Lu, Hongyou/HGT-8518-2022","Lu, Hongyou/0000-0003-1399-1977",Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy,This work was supported by the Hewlett Foundation through the Department of Energy under contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.,,20,84,91,10,78,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,208,214,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.058,0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000453499700021,0

While solar generation comes in many forms, 'shared solar', or a community-based system with an array size intermediate between a large-field and an individual residential system, offers many advantages that utility-scale projects are not able to deliver. The aim of this paper is to examine the development of shared solar initiatives in the recent history of US energy policy in order to reveal lessons that could be applied to future renewable energy generation in other developed nations including the UK and other European countries. Specifically the paper offers original appraisal of the 'solar gardens' scheme being trialled in Minnesota, drawing on findings from a survey with over 650 respondents representing a range of local renewable energy organizations and their customers. We examine the salience and influence of four key factors, namely: (i) perceived individual benefits; (ii) sources and trustworthiness of information; (iii) location; and (iv) project financing. Taken together the findings contribute understanding on the potential for community solar projects to assist in the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.","[Peters, Michael] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England; [Fudge, Shane] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [High-Pipper, Angela; Hoffman, Steven M.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Polit Sci, St Paul, MN USA; [Carragher, Vincent] Trinity Coll Dublin, Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland",University of Reading; University of Exeter; University of St Thomas Minnesota; Trinity College Dublin,"Peters, M (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England.",m.d.peters@reading.ac.uk; s.fudge@exeter.ac.uk; ahighpippe@stthomas.edu; vincent.carragher@tcd.ie,,,,,,,59,29,32,1,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,355,364,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.022,0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000445983800036,0

An interactive budget impact model was created for hospitals to use when considering these technologies.MethodsA Microsoft Excel model was built and populated with base-case costs and probabilities identified through literature search and a survey of US hospital transfusion service directors. Annual costs of PC acquisition, testing, wastage, dispensing/transfusion, sepsis, shelf life, and reimbursement for a mid-sized hospital that purchases all of its PCs were compared for four scenarios: 100% conventional PCs (C-PC), 100% RT-PC, 100% PR-PC, and 50% RT-PC/50% PR-PC.ResultsAnnual total costs were US$3.64, US$3.67, and US$3.96 million when all platelets were C-PC, RT-PC, or PR-PC, respectively, or US$3.81 million in the 50% RT-PC/50% PR-PC scenario. The annual net cost of PR-PC, obtained by subtracting annual reimbursements from annual total costs, is 6.18% above that of RT-PC. Maximum usable shelf lives for C-PC, RT-PC, and PR-PC are 3.0, 5.0, and 3.6days, respectively; hospitals obtain PR-PC components earliest at 1.37days.ConclusionThe model predicts minimal cost increase for PR-PC versus RT-PC, including cost offsets such as elimination of bacterial detection and irradiation, and reimbursement. Additional safety provided by PR, including risk mitigation of transfusion-transmission of a broad spectrum of viruses, parasites, and emerging pathogens, may justify this increase. Effective PC shelf life may increase with RT, but platelets can be available sooner with PR due to elimination of bacterial detection, depending on blood center logistics.","[Prioli, Katherine M.; Pizzi, Laura T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ, 160 Frelinghuysen Rd,Suite 417, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Karp, Julie Katz; Herman, Jay H.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, 111 South 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Lyons, Nina M.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Suite 901, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Chrebtow, Vera] Cerus Corp, Global Mkt & Commun, 2550 Stanwell Dr, Concord, CA 94520 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Jefferson University; Jefferson University; Cerus Corporation,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ, 160 Frelinghuysen Rd,Suite 417, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",katherine.prioli@rutgers.edu; julie.karp@jefferson.edu; nlyons628@gmail.com; vchrebtow@cerus.com; jay.herman@jefferson.edu; laura.pizzi@rutgers.edu,,"Prioli, Katherine/0000-0003-3987-1738; Karp, Julie/0000-0002-5970-4585",Cerus Corporation,Cerus Corporation,This work was supported by a Grant from Cerus Corporation.,,41,15,15,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We use 2005-2013 data on Medicare beneficiaries receiving post-acute care (PAC) in the U.S. to examine integration between hospitals and the two most common post-acute care settings: skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHA), using two measures of integration formal vertical integration and informal integration representing preferential relationships between providers without formal relationships. Our identification strategy is twofold. First, we use longitudinal models with a fixed effect for each hospital-PAC pair in a market to test how changes in integration impact patient outcomes. Second, we use an instrumental variable approach to account for patient selection into integrated providers. We find that vertical integration between hospitals and SNFs increases Medicare payments and reduces rehospitalization rates. However, vertical integration between hospitals and HHAs has little effect, nor does informal integration between hospitals and either PAC setting. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

We show that even under random assignment only the instantaneous average treatment effect is point identified. Since treated and control units drop out at different rates, randomization only ensures the comparability of treatment and controls at the time of randomization, so that long-run average treatment effects are not point identified. Instead, we derive bounds on these average effects. Our bounds do not impose (semi)parametric restrictions, for example, proportional hazards. We also explore assumptions such as monotone treatment response, common shocks and positively correlated outcomes that tighten the bounds. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

They may help addicted smokers to consume nicotine in a less harmful manner or to quit tobacco cigarettes entirely, but these products may also entice youth into smoking. This controversy complicates e-cigarette regulation as any regulation may lead to health improvements for some populations, and health declines for other populations. Using data from 2007 to 2016, we examine factors that are plausibly linked with U.S. state e-cigarette regulations. We find that less conservative states are more likely to regulate e-cigarettes and that states with stronger tobacco lobbies are less likely to regulate e-cigarettes. This information can help policymakers as they determine how best to promote public health through regulation.","[Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Oney, Melissa] Temple Univ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 869, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Marti, Joachim] Univ Lausanne, Inst Social & Prevent Med IUMSP, Ctr Hosp Univ Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sindelar, Jody] Yale Univ, Lab Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Sindelar, Jody] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine; Sindelar, Jody] Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Maclean, JC (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 869, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",catherine.maclean@temple.edu,"Marti, Joachim/C-5141-2016","Marti, Joachim/0000-0001-5763-3704",Center for Tobacco Products [P50DA036151]; National Institute on Drug Abuse [P50DA036151]; Food and Drug Administration,Center for Tobacco Products; National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); Food and Drug Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUS Food & Drug Administration (FDA)),"Center for Tobacco Products, Grant/Award Number: P50DA036151; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Grant/Award Number: P50DA036151; Food and Drug Administration",,38,8,9,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAY,2018,27.0,5.0,,,,,897,907,,10.1002/hec.3642,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GB3YG,29468781.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428996100009,0

For those with abdominal stoma surgeries, altered perceptions amplified by peristomal skin condition can increase health burdens. OBJECTIVES: To assess health utility and health-related quality of life in an adult US ostomy sample in the presence of three levels of peristomal skin condition: intact, moderately compromised, and severely compromised. METHODS: The short form 36 health survey version 2, a generic health survey incorporating the six-dimensional health state short form preference-based utility index, was chosen to assess the sample. Analysis of covariance adjusted for age and time from surgery was used. RESULTS: The six-dimensional health state short form utilities for those with intact skin and physical component summary (PCS) levels indicating no physical limitations varied significantly from those with severely compromised skin and indicating the greatest degree of physical limitation (0.833 vs. 0.527). Peristomal skin condition decreases were associated with health utility decreases across all levels of the PCS. Because peristomal skin conditions are intermittent, the analysis presents quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs) per month. Ostomates with intact skin and PCS levels indicating no physical limitations demonstrated significant differences from those with severe skin condition and indicating the greatest degree of physical limitations (26.5 d/mo vs. 15.8 d/mo). As peristomal skin condition worsened, QALDs decreased across all levels of the PCS. A minimally important expected value of health was estimated to be an increase of 2.18 QALDs/mo. CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment from a clinical perspective is more than the elimination of conditions-it is also a return of quality time to an individual.

There is a strong correlation between obesity and depression but limited evidence on the causal effect of weight on mental health. I use an index of genetic risk for high BMI as a source of exogenous variation in weight to provide novel evidence on the effect of weight on mental health. This is one of the first studies to use genetics as an instrument for BMI and to examine the causal relationship between weight and depression. Results are mixed; I find a meaningful and significant effect of weight on suicidal ideation but no effects on counseling and an index of depression. The effect on suicidal ideation is concentrated in white females. From respondent and interviewer opinions of respondent attractiveness, social stigma is a mechanism through which weight affects mental health for white women. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To assess PROs of French patients with HCV treated with different antiviral regimens. Methods: French patients with HCV from 11 clinical trials were included. PROs were measured before, during, and after treatment (Short Form-36 version 2, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-HCV, and Work Productivity and Activity Index: Specific Health Problem). Results: A total of 931 subjects (age 54 +/- 10 years, 60.3% males, 55% employed, 33.5% cirrhotic, 50% treatment-naive, and 45.6% genotype 1) were treated with a combination of interferon, ribavirin, and sofosbuvir (IFN + RBV + SOF) (N = 11; excluded from comparisons), SOF/RBV +/- ledipasvir (LDV) (N = 202), IFN/RBV-free (LDV/SOF, SOF/velpatasvir, or SOF/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir) (N = 594), or placebo (N = 124). The sustained virologic response 12 (SVR-12) rates were 87.1% for IFN-free RBV-containing regimens, 97.6% for IFN/RBV-free regimens, and 0% for placebo. Baseline PRO scores were not different across the treatment groups (all P > 0.10). At the end of treatment, patients treated with IFN-free SOF/RBV +/- LDV experienced moderate declines in their PRO scores (up to -7.9% of a PRO range size; P < 0.05), and placebo-treated group did not have significant changes in their PROs (P > 0.05). In contrast, the IFN/RBV-free group experienced significant on-treatment improvement in most PROs (up to +7.9%; P < 0.05). Despite those on-treatment differences, most PROs improved with SVR-12 and SVR-24 regardless of the regimen. In comparison with matched controls from the United States treated with the same regimens, French subjects had lower baseline PROs but similar or greater post-SVR PRO improvements. Conclusions: The use of IFN- and RBV-free regimens leads to significant PRO improvement during treatment and after SVR in French patients with HCV.","[Cacoub, Patrice] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7211, Paris, France; [Cacoub, Patrice] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Inflammat Immunopathol Biotherapy Dept, Paris, France; [Bourliere, Marc] INSERM, UMRS 959, Paris, France; [Asselah, Tarik] CNRS, FRE3632, Paris, France; [De Ledinghen, Victor] Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Dept Internal Med & Clin Immunol, Paris, France; [Mathurin, Philippe] Hosp Huriez, Lille, France; [Hezode, Christophe] Hosp Mondor, Creteil, France; [Henry, Linda; Stepanova, Maria] Ctr Outcomes Res Liver Dis, Washington, DC USA; [Younossi, Zobair M.] Inova Fairfax Hosp, Ctr Liver Dis, Dept Med, Falls Church, VA USA; [Younossi, Zobair M.] Inova Hlth Syst, Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Falls Church, VA USA",Sorbonne Universite; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite; Universite de Lille; CHU Lille; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Hopital Universitaire Henri-Mondor - APHP; Inova Fairfax Hospital; Inova Health System,"Younossi, ZM (通讯作者)，Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Claude Moore Hlth Educ & Res Bldg,3300 Gallows Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",zobair.younossi@inova.org,"Stepanova, Maria/V-5513-2019; Hezode, Christophe/U-4659-2018; Younossi, Zobair M./JRY-9916-2023; Mathurin, Philippe/A-9121-2018","Stepanova, Maria/0000-0003-0444-8155;","Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA","Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA(Gilead Sciences)","This study was funded by Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA.",,49,17,17,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21.0,10.0,,,,,1218,1225,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.006,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314623.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446871600011,0

This study assessed the extent to which different reviewer types influence review scores and funding outcomes, the emphasis placed on technical merit compared to other criteria by a multistakeholder panel, and the impact of the in-person discussion on agreement among different reviewer types. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of administrative data from PCORI online and in-person Merit Review (N = 1312 applications from the five funding cycles from November 2013 to August 2015). Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Results: For all reviewer types, final review scores were associated with at least one review criterion score from each of the three reviewer types. The strongest predictor of final overall scores for all reviewer types was scientists' prediscussion ratings of technical merit. All reviewers' prediscussion ratings of the potential to improve health care and outcomes, and scientists' ratings of technical merit and patient-centeredness, were associated with funding success. For each reviewer type, overall impact scores from the online scoring were changed on at least half of the applications at the in person panel discussion. Score agreement across reviewer types was greater after panel discussion. Conclusions: Scientist, patient, and stakeholder views all contribute to PCORI Merit Review of applications for research funding. Technical merit is critical to funding success but patient and stakeholder ratings of other criteria also influence application disposition.","[Forsythe, Laura P.; Frank, Lori B.; Tafari, A.

A critical part of this effort is the Hospital Value-based Purchasing Program (HVBP), which rewards or penalizes hospitals based on their quality and episode-based costs of care and incentivizes integration between hospitals and post-acute care providers. Within HVBP, each patient affects hospital performance on a variety of quality and spending measures, and performance translates directly to changes in program points and ultimately dollars. In short, hospital revenue from a patient consists not only of the DRG payment, but also of that patient's marginal future reimbursement. We estimate the magnitude of the marginal future reimbursement for individual patients across each type of quality and performance measure. We describe how those incentives differ across hospitals, including integrated and safety-net hospitals. We find evidence that hospitals improved their performance over time in the areas where they have the highest marginal incentives to improve care, and that integrated hospitals responded more than non-integrated hospitals.

Most studies on the health economic consequences of mobility limitations focus on short-term implications. Objectives: To examine the long-term value of improving mobility in older adults. Methods: Our six-step approach used clinical trial data to calibrate mobility improvements and estimate health economic outcomes using a microsimulation model. First, we measured improvement in steps per day calibrated with clinical trial data examining hylan G-F 20 viscosupplementation treatment. Second, we created a cohort of patients 51 years and older with osteoarthritis. In the third step, we estimated their baseline quality of life. Fourth, we translated steps-per-day improvements to changes in quality of life using estimates from the literature. Fifth, we calibrated quality of life in this cohort to match those in the trial. Last, we incorporated these data and parameters into The Health Economic Medical Innovation Simulation model to estimate how mobility improvements affect functional status limitations, medical expenditures, nursing home utilization, employment, and earnings between 2012 and 2030. Results: In our sample of 12.6 million patients, 66.7% were female and 70% had a body mass index of more than 25 kg/m(2). Our model predicted that a 554-step-per-day increase in mobility would reduce functional status limitations by 5.9%, total medical expenditures by 0.9%, and nursing home utilization by 2.8%, and increase employment by 2.9%, earnings by 10.3%, and monetized quality of life by 3.2% over this 18-year period. Conclusions: Interventions that improve mobility are likely to reduce long-run medical expenditures and nursing home utilization and increase employment.","[Kabiri, Mina] Precis Hlth Econ, 9433 Bee Cave Rd,Suite 252, Austin, TX 78733 USA; [Brauer, Michelle; Sullivan, Jeff] Precis Hlth Econ, Boston, MA USA; [Shafrin, Jason] Precis Hlth Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Gill, Thomas M.] Yale Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Goldman, Dana P.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA",Yale University; University of Southern California,"Kabiri, M (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 9433 Bee Cave Rd,Suite 252, Austin, TX 78733 USA.",mina.kabiri@PHEconomics.com,"Goldman, Dana P/E-7667-2013; Gill, Thomas M./H-7043-2019; Shafrin, Jason/AAI-7041-2020","Goldman, Dana P/0000-0001-8498-6396; Gill, Thomas M./0000-0002-6450-0368; Shafrin, Jason/0000-0001-8444-5979; Kabiri, Mina/0000-0002-3486-7652",Sanofi,Sanofi(Sanofi-Aventis),This study and manuscript development were sponsored by Sanofi.,,38,10,12,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,792,798,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.021,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005751.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438314900006,0

US value framework developers have increased engagement activities, but more needs to be learned about how to best achieve meaningful patient engagement in value assessment. The objective was to glean good practices in patient engagement emerging from patient community experiences, to be used in value assessment. Methods: The National Health Council Value Workgroup conducted a survey and held a focus group with its member advocacy organizations to gather experiences with value framework developers and views on emerging good practices. Results: Ten of 13 organizations completed the survey; reporting 13 interactions with four framework developers. Most rated experiences as good to very good. Emerging good practices included (1) engage early; (2) engage a range of patients; (3) leverage patient-provided information, data resources, and outreach mechanisms; (4) be transparent; and (5) appreciate and accommodate resource constraints. Twelve of 13 organizations participated in the focus group, and this produced 30 emerging good practices in four areas: (1) timing; (2) methodology and data; (3) partnering; and (4) characterizing engagement. Discussion: Patient engagement was limited in early development of value frameworks but has increased in the past few years. Patient groups report positive experiences that can serve as emerging good practices. These groups also reported experienced challenges in their interactions and recommended good practices to mitigate those challenges. Conclusions/Recommendations: The growing pool of patient engagement experiences can be translated into good practices to advance a patient-centered, value-driven health care ecosystem. Lessons learned from these early experiences can help establish recommend emerging good practices that can eventually result in best practices and standards in the field.","[Perfetto, Eleanor M.; Harris, Jason] Natl Hlth Council, Washington, DC USA; [Perfetto, Eleanor M.; Mullins, C.

For big data, it is often no longer possible to fit them by a simple model. Thus, we need to use generic machine learning techniques to find the corresponding model. The current machine learning techniques estimate the values of the corresponding parameters, but they usually do not gauge the accuracy of the corresponding general non-linear model. In this paper, we show how to modify the existing machine learning methodology so that it will not only estimate the parameters, but also estimate the accuracy of the resulting model.","[Kreinovich, Vladik; Kosheleva, Olga] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Comp Sci, 500 W Univ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Dumrongpokaphan, Thongchai] Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Nguyen, Hung T.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Nguyen, Hung T.] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Chiang Mai University; New Mexico State University; Chiang Mai University,"Kreinovich, V (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Comp Sci, 500 W Univ, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",vladik@utep.edu; tcd43@hotmail.com; hunguyen@nmsu.edu; olgak@utep.edu,,,"Chiang Mai University, Thailand; National Science Foundation [HRD-0734825, HRD-1242122, DUE-0926721]; Prudential Foundation","Chiang Mai University, Thailand; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Prudential Foundation","This work was supported by Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

Methods: The procedure involved 1) identifying products' key patents as those with a patent term restoration extension (whenever relevant) or otherwise as the first expiring patent listed in the US Food and Drug Administration's patent register, 2) determining whether the key patent had been extended through an associated pediatric extension, 3) identifying other regulatory exclusivities associated with the drug, and 4) categorizing key patents as active ingredient (or extended) patents versus secondary patents. The accuracy and precision of the procedure's predictions were then tested against a database containing the timing of generic entry for 170 top-selling drugs that lost market exclusivity between 2000 and 2012, on the basis of Medicaid data. Results: Overall, the procedure predicted a median market exclusivity period of 12.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 7.25-14.5) compared with the median actual period of 12.5 years (IQR 8.5-14.75 years). Among the 131 drugs (77%) with active ingredient patents, the median predicted market exclusivity was 12.25 years (IQR 7.5-14.5) compared with a median actual period of 13.0 years (IQR 10.0-14.75). Among the 38 (22%) drugs protected only by secondary patents, the median predicted market exclusivity was 16.0 years (IQR 6.75-19.5), but the median actual market exclusivity was only 8.25 years (IQR 6.25-13.5). Conclusions: The procedure approximated median actual exclusivity with reasonable accuracy and precision for drugs with active ingredient patents, but substantially overestimated exclusivity for drugs with only secondary patents.","[Beall, Reed F.; Darrow, Jonathan J.; Kesselheim, Aaron S.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, PORTAL,Dept Med, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School,"Beall, RF (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",rbeall@bwh.harvard.edu,"Kesselheim, Aaron/R-6793-2017; Darrow, J J/R-8365-2019","Darrow, J J/0000-0002-7351-4243",Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science; Engelberg Foundation,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science; Engelberg Foundation,This study was funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

I find that the expansions increased insurance coverage by between 22 and 30 percentage points, in models that include trends in age, with the increase explained by Medicare coverage, and increased physician visits by 25-35 percent. These expansions also decreased mortality due to kidney disease in the under 65 population by between 0.5 and 1.0 deaths per 100,000. Lastly, I provide evidence for two mechanisms that affected mortality: an increase in access to and use of treatment, which may be due to changes in insurance coverage; and an increase in entry of dialysis clinics and transplant programs.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an information and communication technology (ICT)-facilitated depression care management program. Methods: Cost-effectiveness of the ICT-facilitated care (TC) delivery model was evaluated relative to a usual care (UC) and a supported care (SC) model. TC added automated low-intensity periodic depression assessment calls to patients. Patient-reported outcomes included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey converted into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire-calculated depression-free days (DFDs). Costs and outcomes data were collected over a 24-month period (-6 to 0 months baseline, 0 to 18 months study intervention). Results: A sample of 1406 patients (484 in UC, 480 in SC, and 442 in TC) was enrolled in the nonrandomized trial. TC had a significant improvement in DFDs (17.3; P = 0.011) and significantly greater 12-Item Short Form Health Survey utility improvement (2.1%; P = 0.031) compared with UC. Medical costs were statistically significantly lower for TC (-$2328; P = 0.001) relative to UC but not significantly lower than for SC. TC had more than a 50% probability of being cost-effective relative to SC at willingness-to-pay thresholds of more than $50,000/QALY. Conclusions: An ICT-facilitated depression care (TC) delivery model improved QALYs, DFDs, and medical costs. It was cost-effective compared with SC and dominant compared with UC.","[Hay, Joel W.; Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Univ Pk Campus,VPG 214-L, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lee, Pey-Jiuan; Jin, Haomiao; Ell, Kathleen; Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Suzanne Dworak Peck Sch Social Work, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Guterman, Jeffrey J.; Gross-Schulman, Sandra] Los Angeles Cty Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Guterman, Jeffrey J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wu, Shinyi] Univ Southern Calif, Daniel J Epstein Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of Southern California,"Hay, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Univ Pk Campus,VPG 214-L, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jhay@usc.edu,"Jin, Haomiao/K-4556-2019","Jin, Haomiao/0000-0001-8908-1959",Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services [1R18AE000054-01],Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services,This study was supported by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation for the US Department of Health and Human Services (grant no. 1R18AE000054-01) (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01781013).,,49,14,14,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,561,568,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.11.005,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753353.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432175400011,0

Methods: Adults with self-reported diabetes from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2011-2013) were identified. Reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) and validity (construct, concurrent, criterion, and predictive) of the SF-12v2 were assessed. The SF-12v2 consists of two normalized composite scores: the physical component summary score (PCS12) and the mental component summary score (MCS12). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the instrument structure. Concurrent (convergent and discriminant) validity was assessed by a multitrait-multimethod matrix using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Kessler Scale, and perceived health and mental health questions. The predictive validity was assessed by estimating future limitations. The concurrent validity was tested by comparing the MCS12, PCS12, and utility scores (six-dimensional health state short form) across comorbidity scores. Results: The final sample comprised 2214 diabetic patients with mean normalized (population mean 50; range 0-100) PCS12 and MCS12 scores of 40.81 (standard error 0.33) and 49.82 (standard error 0.26), respectively. The PCS12 and MCS12 scores showed good internal consistency (Cronbach a: PCS12 0.85; MCS12 0.83) and acceptable test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: PCS12 0.72; MCS12 0.63) and produced acceptable goodness-of-fit indices (normed fit index 0.95; comparative fit index 0.95; root mean square error of approximation 0.11 [95% confidence interval 0.1017-0.1188]). The PCS12 and MCS12 were moderately correlated with perceived health and perceived mental health. The MCS12 was highly correlated with the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Kessler Scale. Both the PCS12 and the MCS12 could predict the future health limitations. The PCS12, MCS12, and utility scores demonstrated sensitivity to the presence of comorbidity scores. Conclusions: The SF-12v2 is a valid generic instrument for measuring quality of life in diabetic patients.","[Kathe, Niranjan; Hayes, Corey J.; Bhandari, Naleen Raj; Payakachat, Nalin] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Coll Pharm, 4301 West Markham,Slot 522, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Hayes, Corey J.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Inst Psychiat Res, Div Hlth Serv Res, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Payakachat, N (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Coll Pharm, 4301 West Markham,Slot 522, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",npayakachat@uams.edu,"Payakachat, Nalin/H-4666-2019; KATHE, NIRANJAN/AAI-5014-2020; Bhandari, Naleen Raj/W-3669-2018","KATHE, NIRANJAN/0000-0003-4932-6426; Bhandari, Naleen Raj/0000-0002-4452-8021; Payakachat, Nalin/0000-0002-9526-5356",Translational Training in Addiction [1T32 DA 022981],Translational Training in Addiction,C.J.

Studies on the effect of alcohol use on educational attainment have also failed to find a consistent, negative effect of alcohol use on years of education. Thus, the connections between alcohol use, human capital, and wages remain a topic of debate in the literature. In this study, we use the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate a theoretical model of wage determination that links alcohol use to wages via human capital. We find that nonbinge drinking is associated with lower wage returns to education whereas binge drinking is associated with increased wage returns to both education and work experience. We interpret these counterintuitive results as evidence that alcohol use affects wages through both the allocative and productive efficiency of human capital formation and that these effects operate in offsetting directions. We suggest that alcohol control policies should be more nuanced to target alcohol consumption in the contexts within which it causes harm.","[Bray, Jeremy W.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Hinde, Jesse M.; Aldridge, Arnie P.] RTI Int, Durham, NC USA; [Hinde, Jesse M.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Research Triangle Institute; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Bray, JW (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",jwbray@uncg.edu,"Hinde, Jesse M./AAA-6814-2019; Aldridge, A/X-4091-2019","Aldridge, Arnie/0000-0003-4513-470X; Bray, Jeremy/0000-0001-7712-160X; Hinde, Jesse/0000-0002-0552-401X",RTI Fellows Program,RTI Fellows Program,RTI Fellows Program,,41,3,5,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,E87,E100,,10.1002/hec.3565,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833856.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428523400007,0

We review published commentaries that address the validity, reliability, and conceptual underpinnings of these frameworks. We find common themes of critique regarding the strengths and limitations across frameworks. Particular shortcomings of some frameworks pose greater threats to their face validity and utility compared with others. The most significant limitations include lack of clear perspective (e.g., patient vs. health plan) and poor transparency in accounting for costs and benefits. We then review how each framework adheres to core STF recommendations, with particular emphasis on whether the framework can be used to support coverage decisions by health insurers, and whether it adheres to core principles of cost-effectiveness analysis. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Research framework most closely adheres to core STF recommendations. Others have significant limitations that vary widely from framework to framework. We also review how the frameworks follow STF recommendations for addressing potentially relevant issues beyond cost-effectiveness analysis - for example, equity in resource allocation and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we review whether and how each framework uses value thresholds and addresses affordability concerns. We conclude with suggestions for further research, particularly in the areas of testing the measurement and use of novel elements of value and deliberative processes.","[Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, 505 Lawrence Sq Blvd S, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Gen Internal Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Tufts Medical Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Willke, RJ (通讯作者)，Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, 505 Lawrence Sq Blvd S, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",rwillke@ispor.org,,,,,,,49,44,45,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,155,160,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.011,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477393.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000007,0

Specifically, we extend the correlated random coefficients representation of linear quantile regression (e.g., Koenker, 2005; Section 2.6). We show that panel data allows the econometrician to (i) introduce dependence between the regressors and the random coefficients and (ii) weaken the assumption of comonotonicity across them (i.e., to enrich the structure of allowable dependence between different coefficients). We adopt a fixed effects approach, leaving any dependence between the regressors and the random coefficients unmodeled. We motivate different notions of quantile partial effects in our model and study their identification. For the case of discretely-valued covariates we present analog estimators and characterize their large sample properties. When the number of time periods (T) exceeds the number of random coefficients (P), identification is regular, and our estimates are root N-consistent. When T = P, our identification results make special use of the subpopulation of stayers - units whose regressor values change little over time - in a way which builds on the approach of Graham and Powell (2012). In this just-identified case we study asymptotic sequences which allow the frequency of stayers in the population to shrink with the sample size. One purpose of these discrete bandwidth asymptotics is to approximate settings where covariates are continuously valued and, as such, there is only an infinitesimal fraction of exact stayers, while keeping the convenience of an analysis based on discrete covariates. When the mass of stayers shrinks with N, identification is irregular and our estimates converge at a slower than root N rate, but continue to have limiting normal distributions. We apply our methods to study the effects of collective bargaining coverage on earnings using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). Consistent with prior work (e.g., Chamberlain, 1982; Vella and Verbeek, 1998), we find that using panel data to control for unobserved worker heterogeneity results in sharply lower estimates of union wage premia. We estimate a median union wage premium of about 9 percent, but with, in a more novel finding, substantial heterogeneity across workers. The 0.1 quantile of union effects is insignificantly different from zero, whereas the 0.9 quantile effect is of over 30 percent.

J,"Mullahy, J",,,,"Mullahy, John",,,Individual results may vary: Inequality-probability bounds for some health-outcome treatment effects,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Treatment effects; Probability bounds; Inequality probabilities,PARTIAL IDENTIFICATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; HETEROGENEITY; INFORMATION; VARIABLES; IMPACT; COST,"While many results from the treatment-effect and related literatures are familiar and have been applied productively in health economics evaluations, other potentially useful results from those literatures have had little influence on health economics practice. With the intent of demonstrating the value and use of some of these results in health economics applications, this paper focuses on one particular class of parameters that describe probabilities that one outcome is larger or smaller than other outcomes (inequality probabilities). While the properties of such parameters have been exposited in the technical literature, they have scarcely been considered in informing practical questions in health evaluations. This paper shows how such probabilities can be used informatively, and describes how they might be identified or bounded informatively given standard sampling assumptions and information only on marginal distributions of outcomes. The logic of these results and the empirical implementation thereof-sampling, estimation, and inference-are straightforward. Derivations are provided and several health-related applications are presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Electronic medical records of the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) were used to characterize patients with chronic HCV infection and the treatments they received. Initiation of treatment in 206,544 patients with chronic HCV characterized by viral genotype, demographic characteristics, and comorbid medical and mental illness was studied using a competing events Cox regression over 6 years. Results: With the advent of interferon-free regimens, the proportion treated increased from 2.4% in 2010 to 18.1% in 2015, an absolute increase of 15.7%. Patients with genotype 1 virus, poor response to previous treatment, and liver disease had the greatest increase. Large absolute increases in the proportion treated were observed in patients with HIV co-infection (18.6%), alcohol use disorder (11.9%), and drug use disorder (12.6%) and in African American (13.7%) and Hispanic (13.5%) patients, groups that were less likely to receive interferon-containing treatment. The VHA spent $962 million on interferon-free treatments in 2015, 1.5% of its operating budget. Conclusions: The proportion of patients with HCV treated in VHA increased sevenfold. The VHA was successful in implementing interferon treatment in previously undertreated populations, and this may become the community standard of care.","[Barnett, Paul G.; Joyce, Vilija R.; Lo, Jeanie; Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, 795 Willow Rd,152 MPD, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Barnett, Paul G.; Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Asch, Steven M.; Owens, Douglas K.] VA Ctr Innovat Implementat, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Gidwani-Marszowski, Risha; Asch, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.; Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Hlth Policy, Ctr Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.; Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Hlth Policy, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Desai, Manisha] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Quantitat Sci Unit, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Holodniy, Mark] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Publ Hlth Res Ctr, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Holodniy, Mark] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Geog Med, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Palo Alto Health Care System; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Palo Alto Health Care System; Stanford University,"Barnett, PG (通讯作者)，VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, 795 Willow Rd,152 MPD, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",paul.barnett@va.gov,"Holodniy, Mark/HKN-0001-2023; Joyce, Vilija/A-2578-2013","Holodniy, Mark/0000-0002-6655-7982; Joyce, Vilija/0000-0002-2484-4625; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy/0000-0002-4007-5192",VA Health Services Research and Development Service [IIR 12-059]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DA15612-016]; Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institute on Aging [K01AG037593-01A1],VA Health Services Research and Development Service(US Department of Veterans Affairs); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Veterans Affairs(US Department of Veterans Affairs); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This research was supported by the VA Health Services Research and Development Service study (IIR 12-059) and by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (grant no.

In a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design based on this rule and exact dates of birth, we find that a 1-year delay in kindergarten entry dramatically reduces inattention/hyperactivity at age 7 (effect size = -0.73), a measure of self-regulation with strong negative links to student achievement.

We utilize the technique of list randomization to collect measures of physical intimate partner violence in an experimental impact evaluation of the Government of Zambia's Child Grant Program. The Child Grant Program is an unconditional cash transfer, which targeted female caregivers of children under the age of 5 in rural areas to receive the equivalent of US $24 as a bimonthly stipend. The implementation results show that the list randomization methodology functioned as planned, with approximately 15% of the sample identifying 12-month prevalence of physical intimate partner violence. According to this measure, after 4years, the program had no measurable effect on partner violence. List randomization is a promising approach to incorporate sensitive measures into multitopic evaluations; however, more research is needed to improve upon methodology for application to measurement of violence.","[Peterman, Amber; Palermo, Tia M.] UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, Piazza Santissima Annunziata 12, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Seidenfeld, David] AIR, Washington, DC USA",Istituto degli Innocenti; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Peterman, A (通讯作者)，UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, Piazza Santissima Annunziata 12, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",apeterman@unicef.org,"Palermo, Tia/ABI-8328-2020","Peterman, Amber/0000-0002-3921-5936",United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Zambia; UK Department for International Development (DFID); Irish Aid; Government of Finland; Swedish International Development Cooperation,United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Zambia; UK Department for International Development (DFID); Irish Aid(CGIAR); Government of Finland; Swedish International Development Cooperation,United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Zambia; UK Department for International Development (DFID); Irish Aid; Government of Finland; Swedish International Development Cooperation,,28,16,20,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,622,628,,10.1002/hec.3588,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28880429.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428324700018,0

We adopt a local instrumental variables approach to estimate person-centered treatment (PeT) effects, thereby recovering the full distribution of individual-level causal effects. We find that the transition from a selective early-tracking system to a non-selective one produced, on a fraction of individuals, significantly increased depression and cigarette smoking. These effects were persistent over time. Cognitive abilities did not moderate the effects, but students with lower non-cognitive skills were most likely to be negatively affected by this exposure.

This assumption has never been tested, and knowledge of how the American population values a trade-off between cure and bankruptcy is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative importance among the general American population of improved health versus improved financial risk protection, and to determine the impact of demographics on these preferences. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was performed with 2359 members of the US population. Respondents were asked to value treatments with varying chances of cure and bankruptcy in the presence of a lethal disease. Latent class analysis with concomitant variables was performed, weighted for national representativeness. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: It was found that 31.3% of the American population values cure at all costs. Nevertheless, for 8.5% of the US population, financial solvency dominates concerns for health in medical decision making. Individuals who value cure at all costs are more likely to have had experience with serious disease and to be women. No demographic characteristics significantly predicted individuals who value solvency over cure. CONCLUSIONS: Although the average American values cure more than financial solvency, a cure-at-all-costs rubric describes the preferences of a minority of the population, and 1 in 12 value financial protection over any chances of cure. This study provides empirical evidence for how the US population values a trade-off between avoiding adverse health outcomes and facing bankruptcy. These findings bring to the fore the decision making that individuals face in balancing the acute financial burden of health care access.

Objectives: To estimate important difference (ID) in FKSI-DRS scores that is considered to be meaningful when comparing treatment effect between groups, using mRCC trial data. Methods: Data were derived from two pivotal phase III mRCC trials comparing sunitinib versus interferon alfa (N = 750) in first-line mRCC, and axitinib versus sorafenib (N = 723) in second-line mRCC. The change from baseline in FKSI-DRS score was examined as a function of a set of anchors using the repeated-measures model. Several anchors were evaluated: FKSI item I am bothered by side effects of treatment, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire utility score, and adverse events. Results: When the I am bothered by side effects of treatment score was used as an anchor, the ID ranged between 1.2 and 1.3 points. When change in the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire utility score was used as an anchor, the FKSI-DRS ID ranged between 0.62 and 0.63 points. Selecting the adverse events that corresponded to a maximum worsening in the FKSI-DRS score in either trial, the ID ranged between 0.62 and 0.74 points. Conclusions: Among patients undergoing treatment for mRCC, between-group differences in FKSI-DRS scores as low as 1 point might be meaningful.","[Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, 633 N St Clair,Suite 1900, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Motzer, Robert J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Rini, Brian I.] Cleveland Clin, Taussig Canc Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Cappelleri, Joseph C.; Bushmakin, Andrew G.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Ramaswamy, Krishnan; Hariharan, Subramanian] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Arondekar, Bhakti] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA USA",Northwestern University; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Cella, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Med Social Sci, 633 N St Clair,Suite 1900, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",d-cella@northwestern.edu,,,Pfizer Inc.; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Support Grant/Core Grant [P30 CA008748],Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer); Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Support Grant/Core Grant,This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.

Cambodia, a country with low HIV prevalence (0.7%), high TB burden, and low multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB burden (1.4% of new TB cases, 11% of retreatment cases) introduced Xpert into its TB diagnostic algorithms for people living with HIV (PLHIV) and people with presumptive MDR TB in 2012. The study objective was to estimate these algorithms' costs pre- and post-Xpert introduction in four provinces of Cambodia. Methods Using a retrospective, ingredients-based microcosting approach, primary cost data on personnel, equipment, maintenance, supplies, and specimen transport were collected at four sites through observation, records review, and key informant consultations. Results Across the sample facilities, the cost per Xpert test was US$33.88-US$37.11, clinical exam cost US$1.22-US$1.84, chest X-ray cost US$2.02-US$2.14, fluorescent microscopy (FM) smear cost US$1.56-US$1.93, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear cost US$1.26, liquid culture test cost US$11.63-US$22.83, follow-on work-up for positive culture results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) identification cost US$11.50-US$14.72, and drug susceptibility testing (DST) cost US$44.26. Specimen transport added US$1.39-US$5.21 per sample. Assuming clinician adherence to the algorithms and perfect test accuracy, the normative cost per patient correctly diagnosed under the post-Xpert algorithms would be US$25-US$29 more per PLHIV and US$34-US$37 more per person with presumptive MDR TB (US$41 more per PLHIV when accounting for variable test sensitivity and specificity). Conclusions Xpert test unit costs could be reduced through lower cartridge prices, longer usable life of GeneXpert (R) (Cepheid, USA) instruments, and increased test volumes; however, epidemiological and test eligibility conditions in Cambodia limit the number of specimens received at laboratories, leading to sub-optimal utilization of current instruments. Improvements to patient referral and specimen transport could increase test volumes and reduce Xpert test unit costs in this setting.","[Pallas, Sarah Wood; Courey, Marissa] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent CDC, Div Global HIV AIDS, Ctr Global Hlth, 1600 Clifton Rd NE,MS A-04, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Hy, Chhaily; Killam, Wm.

Despite this, at the time of writing this report, limited regulatory guidance on the use of wearables in clinical trial programs has been published. Objectives: To present recommendations from the Critical Path Institute's Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Consortium regarding the selection and evaluation of wearable devices and their measurements for use in regulatory trials and to support labeling claims. Methods: The evaluation group was composed of Critical Path Institute's clinical outcome assessment (COA) scientists and COA specialists from pharmaceutical trial eCOA solution providers, including COA development and validation specialists. The resulting recommendations were drawn from a broad range of backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise that enriched the development of this report. Recommendations were developed through analysis of existing regulatory guidance relating to COA development and use in clinical trials, medical device certification/clearance regulations, literature-reported best practice, and practical experience of wearable technology application in clinical trials. Results: We identify the essential properties of fit-for-purpose wearables and propose evidence needed to support their use. In addition, we overview the activities required to establish clinical endpoints derived from wearables data. Conclusions: Using this framework, we believe there is enough current understanding to promote the appropriate use of wearables in study protocols. We hope this will provide a basis for discussion among clinical trial stakeholders and catalyze the development of more robust regulatory guidance.","[Byrom, Bill] ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England; [Watson, Chris] ERT, Nottingham, Notts, England; [Doll, Helen; Ballinger, Rachel] ICON Clin Res, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Coons, Stephen Joel; Eremenco, Sonya; Crescioni, Mabel] Crit Path Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Mc Carthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Donohoe, Paul] CRF Hlth, London, England; [Howry, Cindy] AssisTek, Scottsdale, AZ USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; ICON plc,"Byrom, B (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England.",bill.byrom@iconplc.com,,"Crescioni, Mabel/0000-0002-9366-3078; Mc Carthy, Marie/0000-0003-2730-0233",Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [U18 FD005320]; ePRO Consortium,Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; ePRO Consortium,"Critical Path Institute (C-Path) is supported, in part, by Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships Grant Number U18 FD005320 (effective 2015-2020) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

(2010) in the context of Gaussian linear models, has been shown to enjoy important advantages Over other strictly Bayesian and strictly frequentist model-averaging estimators when accounting for problems of uncertainty in the choice of the regressors. In this paper we extend the WALS approach to deal with uncertainty about the specification of the linear predictor in the wider class of generalized linear models (GLMs). We study the large-sample properties of the WALS estimator for GLMs under a local misspecification framework, and the finite-sample properties of this estimator by a Monte Carlo experiment the design of which is based on a real empirical analysis of attrition in the first two waves of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).

The Resolution Theorem states that there exists an aggregation map that is anonymous, unanimous, and continuous if and only if the space of individual preferences is contractible. Here, we turn a non-contractible space of social preferences (modeled as a CW complex) into a contractible space by adding the null preference which models full indifference of society, following the possibility results of Jones et al. (2003) which is based on a topology first considered but rejected by Le Breton and Uriarte (1990). We prove the corresponding extension of the Resolution Theorem by showing that the null preference as a social outcome precisely captures those voter profiles that represent a tie under a Chichilnisky map. Further, the space of these tie profiles is shown to have measure zero in the case that the space of individual preferences is a sphere in any dimension. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Pittel, B",,,,"Pittel, Boris",,,On random exchange-stable matchings,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Consider the group of n men and n women, each with their own preference list for a potential marriage partner. The stable marriage is a bipartite matching such that no unmatched pair (man, woman) prefer each other to their partners in the matching. Its non-bipartite version, with an even number n of members, is known as the stable roommates problem. Jose Alcalde introduced an alternative notion of exchange stable, one-sided, matching: no two members prefer each other's partners to their own partners in the matching. Katarina Cechlarova and David Manlove showed that the e-stable matching decision problem is NP-complete for both types of matchings. We prove that the expected number of e-stable matchings is asymptotic to (pi n/2)(1/2) for two-sided case, and to e(1/2) for one-sided case. However, the standard deviation of this number exceeds 1.13(n), (1.06(n) resp.). As an obvious byproduct, there exist instances of preference lists with at least 1.13(n) (1.06(n) resp.) e-stable matchings. The probability that there is no matching which is stable and e-stable is at least 1 - e(-n1/2-0(1)), (1 - O(2(-n/2)) resp.). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Combined with power results for Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, these results can be used to choose the optimal test statistic, weighting function and, for tests based on kernel estimates, kernel bandwidth. The results show that, in the setting considered here, KS tests are preferred to CvM tests, and that a truncated variance weighting is preferred to bounded weightings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Building on the recent literature on hurdle and double-hurdle models, we propose a double-inflated modelling framework, where the zero observations are allowed to come from the following: nonparticipants; participant misreporters (who have larger loss functions associated with a truthful response); and infrequent consumers. Due to our empirical application, the model is derived for the case of an ordered discrete-dependent variable. However, it is similarly possible to augment other such zero-inflated models (e.g., zero-inflated count models, and double-hurdle models for continuous variables). The model is then applied to a consumer choice problem of cannabis consumption. We estimate that 17% of the reported zeros in the cannabis survey are from individuals who misreport their participation, 11% from infrequent users, and only 72% from true nonparticipants.","[Greene, William] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; [Harris, Mark N.] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Srivastava, Preety] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zhao, Xueyan] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",New York University; Curtin University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Monash University,"Harris, MN (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Curtin Business Sch, Bentley Campus,Bldg 101, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",mark.harris@curtin.edu.au,"Harris, Mark/O-5084-2015; Srivastava, Preety Pratima/AFL-1427-2022","Harris, Mark/0000-0002-1804-4357; Srivastava, Preety Pratima/0000-0001-8656-1914; Zhao, Xueyan/0000-0002-5096-8787","Australian Research Council; Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre, Curtin University","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre, Curtin University","Australian Research Council; Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre, Curtin University",,55,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,372,389,,10.1002/hec.3553,0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28776865.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428523400022,0

Since nicotine is a metabolic stimulant and appetite suppressant, quitting or reducing smoking could lead to weight gain. Using randomized treatment assignment to instrument for smoking, we estimate that quitting smoking leads to an average long-run weight gain of 1.8-1.9 BMI units, or 11-12 pounds at the average height. Semi-aparametric models provide evidence of a diminishing marginal effect of smoking on BMI, while subsample regressions show that the impact is largest for younger individuals, those with no college degree, and those in the lowest quartile of baseline BMI.

In this paper, we present evidence that data harvested by Dstillery can complement efforts of, and data collected by, government agencies and organizations advocating for entrepreneurship, business formation and economic growth, e. g., the Kauffman Foundation. Our website-based behavior data is close to real time and at a geographically granular level. We find that the concentration of a region's visits to website resources for entrepreneurship and business development are statistically related to business start-up and, particularly, growth activity. Visits to websites related to entrepreneurship are more strongly associated with growth entrepreneurship, in contrast to start-up entrepreneurship. While data capture and analysis related to entrepreneurship website activity is in its infancy, this analysis points to the potential of this data source to nowcast business formation and growth at a regional level.","[Slaper, Timothy F.] Indiana Univ, Indiana Business Res Ctr, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bianco, Alyssa; Lenz, Peter E.] Dstillery, New York, NY USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Slaper, TF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Indiana Business Res Ctr, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,1,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,107,113,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8327,0,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000477974500013,0

This paper tests whether health disparities across education are to some extent due to differences in reporting error across education. We test this hypothesis using data from the pooled National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 1999-2012, which include both self-reports and objective verification for an extensive set of health behaviors and conditions, including smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. We find that college graduates are more likely to give false negative reports of obesity and high total cholesterol; one possible explanation for this is social desirability bias. However, college graduates are also significantly less likely to give false positive reports of smoking, obesity, and high cholesterol. Because there are far more truly negative people (who are less likely to give a false positive report) than more truly positive people (who are more likely to give a false negative report), we find that college graduates report their health significantly more accurately overall.","[Choi, Anna] OECD, Paris, France; [Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, 2312 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Cornell University,"Cawley, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 2312 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jhc38@cornell.edu,"Cawley, John/E-6734-2010; Choi, Anna/AAW-9906-2021","Cawley, John/0000-0002-4805-9883; Choi, Anna/0000-0003-1276-3577",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Investigator Award in Health Policy Research,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Investigator Award in Health Policy Research,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Investigator Award in Health Policy Research,,38,17,18,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,E1,E29,,10.1002/hec.3609,0,,,29,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29210133.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428324700001,0

Methods: Data were obtained from the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) health preference scores were estimated on the basis of extrapolations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's healthy days measures. Depression scores were estimated using the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Life expectancy estimates were obtained from US life tables, and QALE was estimated from a weighted combination of the EQ-5D scores and the life expectancy estimates. Outcomes were summarized by depression status for the four health behaviors (smoking, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol drinking, and obesity). Results: For depressed adults, current smokers and the physically inactive had significantly lower EQ-5D scores (0.040 and 0.171, respectively), shorter life expectancy (12.9 and 10.8 years, respectively), and substantially less QALE (8.6 and 10.9 years, respectively). For nondepressed adults, estimated effects were similar but smaller. Heavy alcohol drinking among depressed adults, paradoxically, was associated with higher EQ-5D scores but shorter life expectancy. Obesity was strongly associated with lower EQ-5D scores but only weakly associated with shorter life expectancy. Conclusions: Among depressed adults, physical inactivity and smoking were strongly associated with lower EQ-5D scores, life expectancy, and QALE, whereas obesity and heavy drinking were only weakly associated with these indices. These results suggest that reducing physical inactivity and smoking would improve health more among depressed adults.","[Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, 560 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jia, Haomiao] Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, 560 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zack, Matthew M.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Preuent & Hlth Promot, Atlanta, GA USA; [Gottesman, Irving I.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, St Paul, MN USA; [Gottesman, Irving I.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychiat, St Paul, MN USA; [Thompson, William W.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, Atlanta, GA USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Jia, HM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, 560 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.;Jia, HM (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, 560 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",hj2198@columbia.edu,"Jia, Haomiao/AAU-8276-2021; Gottesman, Irving I/B-9303-2011",,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [200-2011-M-41977]; University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Psychology,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA); University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Psychology,H.J. received support from a contract of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (No. 200-2011-M-41977).

These challenges are exacerbated when longer term effectiveness, and thus value for money, is uncertain, but they can arise even when treatments are proven to be highly cost-effective at the time of launch. This commentary reviews innovative payment solutions proposed in the literature to address the affordability issue, including the use of credit markets and of staged payments linked to patient outcomes, and draws on discussions with payers in the United States and Europe on the feasibility or desirability of operationalizing any of the alternative financing and payment strategies that appear in the literature. This included a small number of semistructured interviews. We conclude that there is a mismatch between the enthusiasm in the academic literature for developing new approaches and the scepticism of payers that they can work or are necessary. For the foreseeable future, affordability pressures will continue to be handled by aggressive price bargaining, high co-pays (in systems in which this is possible), and restricting access to subgroups of patients. Of the mechanisms we explored, outcomes-based payments were of most interest to payers, but the costs associated with operating such schemes, together with implementation challenges, did not make them an attractive option for managing affordability.","[Schaffer, Sarah Karlsberg; Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge; Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Messner, Donna; Tambor, Ellen] Ctr Med Technol Policy, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Towse, A (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",atowse@ohe.org,"Schaffer, Sarah Karlsberg/H-2726-2015; Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),This work was part funded by a research grant from Pfizer.,,14,21,25,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,276,279,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.013,0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566833.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428019200005,0

Methods: A payer-perspective cost-effectiveness model simulated disease progression in patients with RA who had previously failed conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and were starting biologic therapy. Patients commenced treatment with abatacept or adalimumab plus methotrexate and were evaluated after 6 months. Therapy continuation was based on the European League Against Rheumatism treatment response; disease progression was based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score. These score changes were used to estimate health state utilities and direct medical costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained were calculated by baseline ACPA groups (Q1, 28-234 AU/ml; Q2, 235-609 AU/ml; Q3, 613-1045 AU/ml; and Q4, 1060-4894 AU/ml). Scenario analysis and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate robustness of model assumptions. Results: Abatacept resulted in QALY gain versus adalimumab in ACPA Q1, Q3, and Q4; between-treatment difference (difference: Q1, -0.115 Q2, -0.009 Q3, 0.045; and Q4, 0.279). Total lifetime discounted cost was higher for abatacept versus adalimumab in most quartiles (Q2, 77,612 pound vs. 77,546; pound Q3, 74,441 pound vs. 73,263; pound and Q4, 78,428 pound vs. 76,696) pound because of longer time on treatment. Incremental cost per QALY for abatacept (vs. adalimumab) was the lowest in the high ACPA titer group (Q4, 6200 pound/QALY), followed by the next lowest titer group (Q3, 26,272 pound/QALY). Conclusions: Abatacept is a cost effective alternative to adalimumab in patients with RA with high ACPA levels.","[Alemao, Evo] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Route 206 & Prov Line Rd, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Johal, Sukhvinder] PAREXEL Int, London, England; [Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Law, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rutten-van Molken, Maureen] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Parexel International; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Alemao, E (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Route 206 & Prov Line Rd, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",evo.alemao@bms.com,"Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/X-8712-2019; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/G-8481-2014","Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159","Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ); BMS","Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ); BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","This study was sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ).

A two-step approach is employed to derive the conditional type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II) posterior distribution of the coefficients and individual effects. The ML-II posterior means are weighted averages of the Bayes estimator under a base prior and the data-dependent empirical Bayes estimator. Two-stage and three stage hierarchy estimators are developed and their finite sample performance is investigated through a series of Monte Carlo experiments. These include standard random effects as well as Mundlak-type, Chamberlain-type and Hausman Taylor-type models. The simulation results underscore the relatively good performance of the three-stage hierarchy estimator. Within a single theoretical framework, our Bayesian approach encompasses a variety of specifications while conventional methods require separate estimators for each case. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The geographic and timing variation in the rollout of the South African National Adolescent Friendly Clinic Initiative (NAFCI) in the early 2000s provides a plausibly exogenous increase in reproductive health knowledge and clinical access for teens. We investigate the causal pathway from the intervention's initial impact on early-teen childbearing to subsequent consequences for later-life outcomes of prime policy interest education, employment and child health. Our empirical strategy uses CPS data from the National Income Dynamics Study to geolink women's location of residence during adolescence to the location and timing of the rollout. Our results show that living near a NAFCI clinic during adolescence delayed childbearing, substantially lowering the likelihood of early teen childbearing. We estimate that adolescents who had access to NAFCI completed more years of schooling and, consistent with increased human capital investments, earn substantially higher wages as young adults. Finally, children born to women who had access to youth-friendly services as teens show substantial health advantages, indicating a strong intergenerational benefit of delaying early teen childbearing in a developing country context.

Some studies, however, present evidence of both positive and negative explanatory channels in the relationship between others' income and SWB. We develop a theoretical framework integrating four distinct channels through which neighbors' income can affect utility: public goods, cost of living, expectations of future income, and direct effects (RIH or altruism). We estimate the relationship with SWB data from the U.S. Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index and median-income data from the American Community Survey for ZIP codes and MSAs. The relationship is proximity-dependent: positive (negative) when using ZIP-code (MSA) median income as reference income, suggesting that positive (negative) channels dominate locally (regionally) and reconciling the literature's seemingly divergent results. These findings are consistent across SWB measures and many health-related indices. Additional analyses support the public-goods and cost-of living channels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. Methods: A total of 1432 hypertensive participants were recruited from 18 primary health care centers. The intervention included home visits led by community health workers, physician education, and text messaging. Resource use and quality of life data using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire were prospectively collected. The study perspective was that of the public health care system, and the time horizon was 18 months. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze cost and health outcomes (systolic blood pressure [SBP] change and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). A 1 time gross domestic product per capita per QALY was used as the cost-effectiveness threshold (US $14,062). Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two arms. QALYs significantly increased by 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.09) in the intervention group, and SBP net difference favored the intervention group: 5.3 mm Hg (95% CI 0.27-10.34). Mean total costs per participant were higher in the intervention arm: US $304 in the intervention group and US $154 in the control group (adjusted difference of US $140.18; 95% CI US $75.41-US $204.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3299 per QALY (95% credible interval 1635-6099) and US $26 per mm Hg of SBP (95% credible interval 13-46). Subgroup analysis showed that the intervention was cost-effective in all prespecified subgroups (age, sex, cardiovascular risk, and body mass index). Conclusions: The multicomponent intervention was cost-effective for blood pressure control among low-income hypertensive patients.","[Augustovski, Federico; Chaparro, Martin; Palacios, Alfredo; Beratarrechea, Andrea; Irazola, Vilma; Rubinstein, Adolfo; Pichon Riviere, Andres] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico; Rubinstein, Adolfo; Pichon Riviere, Andres] Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Publ Hlth, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, New Orleans, LA USA; [Mills, Katherine; He, Jiang] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Epidemiol, New Orleans, LA USA; [Mills, Katherine; He, Jiang] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Translat Sci Inst, New Orleans, LA USA",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Tulane University; Tulane University; Tulane University,"Augustovski, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Hlth Technol Assessment & Hlth Econ Dept, Emilio Ravignani 2024,C1414CPV, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",faugustovski@iecs.org.ar,"shi, li/HSF-9608-2023; Palacios, Alfredo/ABH-1283-2021; He, Jiang/AAF-5303-2020","Palacios, Alfredo/0000-0001-7684-0880; He, Jiang/0000-0002-8286-9652; Augustovski, Federico/0000-0002-2914-5022; Pichon-Riviere, Andres/0000-0001-6052-025X; Andrea, Beratarrechea/0000-0002-6397-4406","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health under the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases program [U01HL114197]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health under the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases program; National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","The HCPIA was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (grant no.

While positive socioeconomic effects and spill-over effects are well-documented, this is the first paper to evaluate the effects of the programme on nutritional outcomes of under-5 children using data from a randomized control trial over a four-year period. We find notable improvements in nutritional outcomes of children in participating households. TUP is further seen to improve food-security, sanitation and duration of exclusive-breastfeeding. Nutrition status of children living in poor non-participant households are also positively affected though no effects were found on children from non-poor households. We conclude that programmes that combine asset transfer with multifaceted training such as TUP can have significant long-term positive health effects.

To support extension of this unique collaborative model to other funders, information from the reviewers on the review process is needed to understand how scientists and nonscientists evaluate research proposals together. Thus, this study aimed to describe reviewers' perspectives of the interactions during the in-person review panel; to examine the value and challenges of including scientists, patients, and stakeholders together; and to understand the perceived importance of PCORI's review criteria. Methods: This study utilized anonymous, cross-sectional surveys (N = 925 respondents from 5 funding cycles: 470 scientists, 217 patients, 238 stakeholders; survey completion rates by cycle: 70-89%) and group interviews (N = 18). Results: Reviewers of all types describe PCORI Merit Review as respectful, balanced, and one of reciprocal influence among different reviewer types. Reviewers indicate strong support and value of input from all reviewer types, receptivity to input from others, and the panel chair's incorporation of all views. Patients and stakeholders provide real-world perspectives on importance to patients, research partnership plans, and study feasibility. Challenges included concerns about a lack of technical expertise of patient/stakeholder reviewers and about scientists dominating conversations. The most important criterion for assigning final review scores was technical merit either alone or in conjunction with patient-centeredness or patient/stakeholder engagement. Conclusions: PCORI Merit Reviewers' self-reports indicate that the perspectives of different reviewer types are influential in panel discussions and Merit Review outcomes.","[Forsythe, Laura P.; Frank, Lori B.; Hemphill, Rachel; Tafari, A.

Specifically, we propose a data-driven procedure for constructing a class of simultaneous confidence regions for a subset of the entries of a large precision matrix. The confidence regions can be applied to test for specific structures of a precision matrix, and to recover its nonzero components. We first construct an estimator for the precision matrix via penalized node-wise regression. We then develop the Gaussian approximation to approximate the distribution of the maximum difference between the estimated and the true precision coefficients. A computationally feasible parametric bootstrap algorithm is developed to implement the proposed procedure. The theoretical justification is established under the setting which allows temporal dependence among observations. Therefore the proposed procedure is applicable to both independent and identically distributed data and time series data. Numerical results with both simulated and real data confirm the good performance of the proposed method.

We apply the result to show: (i) if excess demand satisfies the gross substitutes property then the competitive exchange equilibrium is stable iff intuitive comparative statics hold, (ii) the market demand curve for bandwagon (or network) goods slopes upwards only if equilibrium is unstable, and (iii) equilibria of supermodular games are stable iff they exhibit monotone comparative statics. We also provide a non-local version of the result for linear models, and apply the insights to the input-output model and network games with linear best replies and strategic complementarities.

Each bidder's privately known type may affect both his risk attitude and the expected value of the asset's return to the winner. An ex post equilibrium in which the winning bidder has the largest willingness to pay for the asset exists if two conditions hold: each bidder's marginal utility of income is log-supermodular, and the vector-valued function mapping the type vector into the bidders' expected values for the asset satisfies a weighted average crossing condition. However, this equilibrium need not be efficient. We show that it is efficient if each bidder's expected value for the asset is nonincreasing in the types of the other bidders, or if the bidders exhibit nonincreasing absolute risk aversion, or if the asset is riskless.

Alongside these developments, good practice guidelines for the application of MCDA in health care have been developed. An assessment of current applications of MCDA to HTA in light of good practice guidelines reveals, however, that many have methodologic flaws that undermine their usefulness. Three challenges are considered: the use of additive models, a lack of connection between criteria scales and weights, and the use of MCDA in economic evaluation. More attention needs to be paid to MCDA good practice by researchers, journal editors, and decision makers and further methodologic developments are required if MCDA is to achieve its potential to support HTA.","[Marsh, Kevin D.; Tervonen, Tommi] Evidera, London, England; [Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Caro, J.

Three key results differ from those in regular models. First, both the threshold point and the threshold effect parameters are shown to be identified without the need for instrumentation. Second, in partially linear threshold models, both parametric and nonparametric components rely on the same data, which prima facie suggests identification failure. But, as shown here, the discontinuity structure of the threshold itself supplies identifying information for the parametric coefficients without the need for extra randomness in the regressors. Third, instrumentation plays different roles in the estimation of the system parameters, delivering identification for the structural coefficients in the usual way, but raising convergence rates for the threshold effect parameters and improving efficiency for the threshold point. Simulation studies corroborate the theory and the asymptotics. An empirical application is conducted to explore the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings, illustrating the relevance of threshold models in treatment effects evaluation in the presence of endogeneity.

In this study, we add to the literature by examining changes in admissions to SUD treatment following the implementation of a 2010 Affordable Care Act provision requiring health insurers to offer dependent coverage to young adult children of their beneficiaries under age 26. We use national administrative data on admissions to specialty SUD treatment and apply a difference-in-differences design to study effects of the expansion on the rate of treatment utilization among young adults and, among those in treatment, changes in insurance status and payment source. We find that admissions to treatment declined by 11% after the expansion. However, the share of young adults covered by private insurance increased by 5.4 percentage points and the share with private insurance as the payment source increased by 3.7 percentage points. This increase was largely offset by decreased payment from government sources.

This paper explores whether the use of a new HIV prevention product, with 100% efficacy but modeled after pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), could change the price and quantity of condomless commercial sex supplied. We collected stated preference data from 122 HIV-negative female sex workers in urban South Africa, using a repeated choice experiment to simulate the impact of using PrEP on choices. Results suggest that the price premium for condomless sex would decrease by 73% with PrEP use and the quantity of condomless sex is predicted to increase by a factor of 2.27. Act price does not significantly affect choices without protection but strongly influences choices under full HIV protection. The utility offered by condoms reduces by around 15% under PrEP use. Because new HIV prevention products do not protect against other STIs or pregnancy, the unintended consequences of introducing HIV prevention products should be closely monitored, whereas users should not face stigma or blame for reacting rationally to exogenous changes to market conditions.","[Quaife, Matthew; Eakle, Robyn; Terris-Prestholt, Fern] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Quaife, Matthew; Eakle, Robyn; Cabrera-Escobar, Maria A.; Delany-Moretlwe, Sinead] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits RHI, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Vickerman, Peter] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Manian, Shanthi] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Witwatersrand; University of Bristol; Washington State University,"Quaife, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",matthew.quaife@lshtm.ac.uk,"Quaife, Matthew/O-4754-2015","Quaife, Matthew/0000-0001-9291-1511; Vickerman, Peter/0000-0002-8291-5890; Terris-Prestholt, Fern/0000-0003-1693-5196; Manian, Shanthi/0000-0002-0013-5138",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Department for International Development; Economic and Social Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Studentship",,61,11,14,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27.0,10.0,,,,,1550,1566,,10.1002/hec.3784,0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29926508.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000443806600011,0

Methods: Individuals with more than two multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Reuision code 340) were identified from the Market-Scan database (2006-2009). Heterogeneity in treatment was normalized by calculating an annual OOP payment as the average OOP payment for purchasing a fixed basket of DMTs at the insurance plan level. A local linear regression with a model-based recursive partitioning algorithm was applied to explore the relationship between OOP and consequently lower DMT use and adherence as measured by days covered by DMT. Results: We identified the inflection points in annual OOP payments as $442 for DMT use and $890 for DMT adherence. For patients with annual OOP payments of more than $442, a $100 increase in OOP payment was associated with a decline of 0.6% in DMT use; for annual OOP payments of more than $890, a $100 increase in OOP payment was associated with two fewer days of DMT treatments. Conclusions: Although the use of DMTs and DMT adherence appeared unassociated with OOP payment below $442 and $890, respectively, an excessive OOP payment was a barrier to DMT access. This information can inform maximum monthly and yearly payment caps when designing valued-based insurance plans.","[Shao, Hui; Stoecker, Charles; Monnette, Alisha M.; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,42,14,14,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1083,1089,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.025,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224113.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000444833500011,0

Objectives: To address the need for an ability to measure the magnitude of low-value care nationwide, identify the clinical services that are the greatest contributors to waste, and track progress toward eliminating low-value use of these services. Such an ability could provide valuable input to the efforts of policymakers and health systems to improve efficiency. Methods and Results: We reviewed existing methods that could contribute to measuring low-value care and developed an integrated framework that combines multiple methods to comprehensively estimate and track the magnitude and principal sources of clinical waste. We also identified a process and needed research for implementing the framework. Conclusions: A comprehensive methodology for measuring and tracking low-value care in the United States would provide an important contribution toward reducing waste. Implementation of the framework described in this article appears feasible, and the proposed research program will allow moving incrementally toward full implementation while providing a near-term capability for measuring low value care that can be enhanced over time.","[Miller, George; Rhyan, Corwin; Beaudin-Seiler, Beth; Hughes-Cromwick, Paul] Altarum Ctr Value Hlth Care, Ann Arbor, MI USA",,"Miller, G (通讯作者)，Altarum Inst Ctr Value Hlth Care Spending, 3520 Green Court,Suite 300, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",george.miller@altarum.org,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Princeton, NJ) [73409]","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Princeton, NJ)(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF))","This article describes work conducted under a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (Princeton, NJ) (grant no. 73409).",,19,27,32,4,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21.0,4.0,,,,,375,379,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.017,0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680091.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430442800002,0

The traditional survival partition model (SPM) cannot accurately predict long-term clinical outcomes because it is limited by its ability to capture the key consequences associated with this changing treatment paradigm. The objective of this study was to introduce and validate a discrete-event simulation (DES) model for prostate cancer. Methods: A DES model was developed to simulate overall survival (OS) and other clinical outcomes based on patient characteristics, treatment received, and disease progression history. We tested and validated this model with clinical trial data from the abiraterone acetate phase III trial (COUAA-302). The model was constructed with interim data (55% death) and validated with the final data (96% death). Predicted OS values were also compared with those from the SPM. Results: The DES model's predicted time to chemotherapy and OS are highly consistent with the final observed data. The model accurately predicts the OS hazard ratio from the final data cut (predicted: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.85 and final actual: 0.74; 95% CI 0.6-0.88). The log-rank test to compare the observed and predicted OS curves indicated no statistically significant difference between observed and predicted curves. However, the predictions from the SPM based on interim data deviated significantly from the final data. Conclusions: Our study showed that a DES model with properly developed risk equations presents considerable improvements to the more traditional SPM in flexibility and predictive accuracy of long-term outcomes.","[Reifsnider, Odette; Sorensen, Sonja V.] Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Av,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Proskorovsky, Irina] Evidera, Quebec City, PQ H4T 1V6, Canada; [Pan, Feng; Zheng, Ying; Li, Tracy; He, Jianming] Janssen Global Serv LLC, Raritan, NJ 08869 USA",Evidera; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Sorensen, SV (通讯作者)，Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Av,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sonja.sorensen@evidera.com,,", Jianming/0000-0002-5015-3713",Janssen Global Services LLC,Janssen Global Services LLC,Financial support for the study and resulting manuscript was provided by Janssen Global Services LLC.,,38,10,10,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21.0,4.0,,,,,416,422,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.022,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680098.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430442800009,0

METHODS: The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices and other recommendations were used to conduct a discrete-choice experiment. Members of a US online panel with type 2 diabetes mellitus completed a Web-enabled, self-administered survey that elicited choices between treatment pairs with six attributes at three possible levels each. A D-efficient experimental design blocked 48 choice tasks into three 16-task surveys. Preference estimates were obtained using mixed logit estimation and were used to calculate choice probabilities. RESULTS: A total of 552 participants (51% males) completed the survey. Avoiding 90 minutes of nausea was valued the highest (mean -10.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.53 to -9.47). Participants wanted to avoid low blood glucose during the day and/or night (mean -3.87; 95% CI -4.32 to -3.42) or one pill and one injection per day (mean -7.04; 95% CI -7.63 to -6.45). Participants preferred stable blood glucose 6 d/wk (mean 4.63; 95% CI 4.15 to 5.12) and a 1% decrease in glycated hemoglobin (mean 5.74; 95% CI 5.22 to 6.25). If cost increased by $1, the probability that a treatment profile would be chosen decreased by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the idea that people have strong preferences for immediate consequences of medication. Despite efforts to produce recommendations, ambiguity surrounding good practices remains and various judgments need to be made when conducting stated-preference studies. To ensure transparency, these judgments should be described and justified. Copyright (c) 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Published tables (Schalet BD, Rothrock NE, Hays RD, et al. Linking physical and mental health summary scores from the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) to the PROMIS((R)) Global Health Scale. J Gen Intern Med 2015;30:1524-30) link scores from the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) to the 10-Item Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a global health scale metric for both mental (GMH) and physical (GPH) summary scores. Methods: We assessed the accuracy of administered PROMIS and VR-12 scores with scores predicted by cross-walks in 4606 adult patients seen in a spine clinic from October 2015 to 2016. Accuracy of linking scores was evaluated using Pearson correlation, intraclass correlation coefficients, and mean and SD of score differences. Bland-Altman plots were used to graphically assess the levels of agreement. The consistency in scores' discrimination across levels of pain severity, depression, and other patient characteristics was assessed. Bootstrap methods estimated linking precision across varying sample sizes. Results: Actual and cross-walked PROMIS scores showed moderate correlation (ICC(3,1): GMH 0.73; GPH 0.81), with Bland-Altman plots suggesting smaller differences between scores in patients with lower and higher general health. Significant discrimination between patient subgroups was demonstrated reliably by both actual and estimated scores. Bootstrapped resamples indicated adequate precision for 200 patients (95% confidence interval for mean difference: GMH -1.38 to 0.60; GPH 0.39 to 1.93). Conclusions: VR-12 and PROMIS global health scores can be accurately linked within a sample of patients with spine disorders; nevertheless, bias is high and precision is low for linking on the patient level. Linked scores at the group level for more than 200 patients can be used in comparative effectiveness research and for comparing results across studies.","[Lapin, Brittany R.; Kinzy, Tyler G.; Thompson, Nicolas R.; Katzan, Irene L.] Cleveland Clin, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, Cerebrovasc Ctr, Neurol Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,JJ3-603, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lapin, Brittany R.; Kinzy, Tyler G.; Thompson, Nicolas R.] Cleveland Clin, Quantitat Hlth Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Krishnaney, Ajit] Cleveland Clin, Ctr Spine Hlth, Neurol Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Lapin, BR (通讯作者)，Cleveland Clin, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, Cerebrovasc Ctr, Neurol Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,JJ3-603, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",lapinb@ccf.org,"Katzan, Irene/HTN-4182-2023","Lapin, Brittany/0000-0002-4314-2282",,,,,36,12,13,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21.0,10.0,,,,,1226,1233,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.011,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314624.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446871600012,0

The test is based on realized third moments, and uses observations over an increasing time span. The test offers an alternative to standard finite time span tests, and is designed to detect jumps in the data generating process rather than detecting realized jumps over a fixed time span. More specifically, we make two contributions. First, we introduce our largely model free jump test for the null hypothesis of zero jump intensity. Second, under the maintained assumption of strictly positive jump intensity, we introduce two self-excitement tests for the null of constant jump intensity against the alternative of path dependent intensity. These tests have power against autocorrelation in the jump component, and are direct tests for Hawkes diffusions (see, e.g. Ait-Sahalia et al. (2015)). The limiting distributions of the proposed statistics are analyzed via use of a double asymptotic scheme, wherein the time span goes to infinity and the discrete interval approaches zero; and the distributions of the tests are normal and half normal. The results from a Monte Carlo study indicate that the tests have reasonable finite sample properties. An empirical illustration based on the analysis of 11 stock price series indicates the prevalence of jumps and self-excitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach employs sequential importance sampling and is based on deriving an unbiased estimate of the likelihood within a Metropolis chain. Under fairly weak regularity conditions unbiasedness guarantees that the stationary density of the chain is the exact posterior, not an approximation. Results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation using two examples. The first is a dynamic game of entry involving a small number of firms whose heterogeneity is based on their current costs due to feedback through capacity constraints arising from past entry. The second is an Ericson and Pakes (1995) style game with a large number of firms whose heterogeneity is based on the qualitiof their products with firms competing through investment in product quality that affects their market share and profitability. Our approach facilitates estimation of dynamic games with either small or large number of players whose heterogeneity is determined by latent state variables, discrete or continuous, that are subject to endogenous feedback from past actions.

Linking administrative records from Hospital Episode Statistics (2003-2012) with immigration data drawn from the UK Labour Force Survey, we find that immigration reduced waiting times for outpatient referrals and did not have significant effects on waiting times in accident and emergency departments (A&E) and elective care. The reduction in outpatient waiting times can be explained by the fact that immigration increases natives' internal mobility and that immigrants tend to be healthier than natives who move to different areas. Finally, we find evidence that immigration increased waiting times for outpatient referrals in more deprived areas outside of London. The increase in average waiting times in more deprived areas is concentrated in the years immediately following the 2004 EU enlargement and disappears in the medium term (e.g., 3-4 years).

Objectives: To explore whether the coding to document smoking behavior has increased over time and to assess the accuracy of smoking-related diagnosis and procedure codes in identifying previous and current smokers. Methods: We conducted an observational study with 5,423,880 enrollees from the year 2009 to 2014 in the Truven Health Analytics database. Temporal trends of smoking coding, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were measured. Results: The rate of coding of smoking behavior improved significantly by the end of the study period. The proportion of patients in the claims data recorded as current smokers increased 2.3-fold and the proportion of patients recorded as previous smokers increased 4-fold during the 6-year period. The sensitivity of each International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Reuision, Clinical Modification code was generally less than 10%. The diagnosis code of tobacco use disorder (305.1X) was the most sensitive code (9.3%) for identifying smokers. The specificities of these codes and the Current Procedural Terminology codes were all more than 98%. Conclusions: A large improvement in the coding of current and previous smoking behavior has occurred since the inception of the meaningful use policy. Nevertheless, the use of diagnosis and procedure codes to identify smoking behavior in administrative data is still unreliable. This suggests that quality improvements toward medical coding on smoking behavior are needed to enhance the capability of claims data for smoking-related outcomes research.","[Huo, Jinhai] Univ Florida, Dept Hlth Serv Res Management & Policy, Gainesville, FL USA; [Yang, Ming; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Unit 1444,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Shih, YCT (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Unit 1444,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",yashih@mdanderson.org,"Huo, Jinhai Stephen/M-2615-2014","Huo, Jinhai Stephen/0000-0002-5477-9756; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864; Yang, Ming/0000-0002-6211-9985",Duncan Family Institute; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Halliburton Employees Foundation,Duncan Family Institute; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Halliburton Employees Foundation,"We thank Dr Gary Deyter, technical writer from the Department of Health Services Research at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, for his editorial assistance.

We replicate the result for opioid overdose deaths and explore the potential mechanism. The key feature of a medical marijuana law that facilitates a reduction in overdose death rates is a relatively liberal allowance for dispensaries. As states have become more stringent in their regulation of dispensaries, the protective value generally has fallen. These findings suggest that broader access to medical marijuana facilitates substitution of marijuana for powerful and addictive opioids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Appointment offers and wait times for Medicare and privately insured patients were unaffected by Medicaid fees. At mean state Medicaid fees, our analysis predicts a 27-percentage-point disadvantage for Medicaid versus Medicare in appointment offers. This decreases to 6 percentage points when Medicaid and Medicare fees are equal, suggesting that permanent fee parity with Medicare could eliminate most of the disparity in appointment offers for Medicaid patients. The predicted decrease in the disparity is smaller for Black and Hispanic patients than for White patients. Our research highlights the importance of considering the effects of policy on nontarget patient groups, and the consequences of seemingly race-neutral policies on racial/ethnic and sex-based disparities.","[Sharma, Rajiv; Tinkler, Sarah; Mitra, Arnab; Pal, Sudeshna; Susu-Mago, Raven] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Stano, Miron] Oakland Univ, Rochester, MI 48063 USA",Portland State University; Oakland University,"Sharma, R (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",sharmar@pdx.edu,,"Tinkler, Sarah/0000-0002-3902-9199","Portland State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; Portland State University, Faculty Enhancement Committee; Portland State University, Institute for Sustainable Solutions; Portland State University, Office of Research and Strategic Partnerships","Portland State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; Portland State University, Faculty Enhancement Committee; Portland State University, Institute for Sustainable Solutions; Portland State University, Office of Research and Strategic Partnerships","Portland State University, Grants/Awards: College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Faculty Enhancement Committee, Institute for Sustainable Solutions and Office of Research and Strategic Partnerships",,24,16,19,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,629,636,,10.1002/hec.3591,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28944526.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428324700019,0

I test whether disease outbreaks increase vaccination using a new dataset of county -level disease and vaccination data. I find that pertussis (whooping cough) outbreaks in a county decrease the share of unvaccinated children entering kindergarten. These responses do not reflect changes in the future disease risk. I argue that these facts are best fit by a model in which individuals are both myopic and irrational. This suggests that better promotion of information about outbreaks could enhance the response.

General population-based age- and sex-specific percentile norms are, however, not published to date, although these are needed as reference for the interpretation of clinical research data. Objectives: To assess the FACIT-Fatigue Scale in a large representative sample of the German general population to examine psychometric characteristics and factorial structure and to provide population-based norms. Methods: A nationally representative face-to-face household survey was conducted in Germany using the FACIT-Fatigue Scale. Item characteristics were examined. Internal consistency was determined using the Cronbach a. Dimensionality was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and bifactor analysis. Scale score differences relating to sex and age were assessed. Sex- and age-specific percentiles were computed for the entire scale range. Results: Of 2426 participants, 55.7% were women, and the mean age was 49.8 +/- 17.4 years. The FACIT-Fatigue Scale mean was 43.5 +/- 8.3. Cronbach a was high at 0.92. Although fit indices of the CFA were below desired levels (root mean squared error of approximation = 0.144, comparative fit index = 0.846, and Tucker-Lewis index = 0.815), item loadings in the CFA and bifactor analysis confirm the scale's unidimensionality. Women were more fatigued than men, and participants who were 70 years or older showed higher fatigue scores than younger respondents. Thus, sex- and age-specific population-based percentiles were provided. Conclusions: Reliability and validity of the German translation of the FACIT-Fatigue Scale were confirmed. This study provides general population-based sex- and age-specific FACIT-Fatigue Scale percentile norms for the first time, thereby contributing to a meaningful interpretation of clinical research data.","[Montan, Inka] Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Internal Med & Psychosomat, Thibautstr 4, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Montan, Inka; Loewe, Bernd] Uniuers Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Hamburg, Germany; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Mehnert, Anja; Hinz, Andreas] Univ Leipzig, Dept Med Psychol & Med Sociol, Leipzig, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Leipzig University,"Montan, I (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Internal Med & Psychosomat, Thibautstr 4, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",inka.montan@med.uni-heidelberg.de,"Mehnert-Theuerkauf, Anja/A-1177-2008; Montan, Inka/ABG-9319-2021; Löwe, Bernd/AAG-4038-2020","Mehnert-Theuerkauf, Anja/0000-0002-6872-9805; Lowe, Bernd/0000-0003-4220-3378; Montan, Inka/0000-0002-8638-5823","University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany; University of Leipzig, Germany","University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany; University of Leipzig, Germany","The study was supported by intramural means of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, and the University of Leipzig, Germany.

The literature also shows that the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal when the sample size of the original data considered goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, there is little discussion on the large sample behaviour of the posterior mean. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. In particular, we extend the posterior mean idea to the conditional mean case, which is conditioning on a given vector of summary statistics of the original data. We establish a new asymptotic theory for the conditional mean estimator for the case when both the sample size of the original data concerned and the number of Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations go to infinity. Simulation studies show that this conditional mean estimator has very good finite sample performance. In addition, we employ the conditional mean estimator to estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for S&P 500 stock returns and find that the conditional mean estimator performs better than quasi-maximum likelihood estimation in terms of out-of-sample forecasting.

The effect of friends' behaviors is identified by comparing similar individuals who have similar friendship opportunities and make similar friendship choices, exploiting the idea that friendship choice reveals information about unobservables. We combine this identification strategy with an across-cohort within school design so that identification arises in our reduced form estimates from across-grade differences in the clustering of health behaviors. Finally, we use estimated information on correlated unobservables to examine longitudinal data on the onset of health behaviors, where the likelihood of reverse causality should be minimal. We find evidence that this strategy produces somewhat smaller (no more than 16% smaller) friendship effect estimates than the more standard school fixed effect models consistent with at most modest bias from correlated unobservables.","[Fletcher, Jason M.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Sociol, Madison, WI USA; [Fletcher, Jason M.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI USA; [Fletcher, Jason M.] Univ Wisconsin, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Ross, Stephen L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Connecticut,"Fletcher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jmfletcher@wisc.edu,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921]; Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [P30 AG017266]; Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [P2C HD047873]; NICHD [1R21 HD066230-01A1],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Grant/Award Number: P01-HD31921; Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Grant/Award Number: P30 AG017266; Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Grant/Award Number: P2C HD047873; NICHD, Grant/ Award Number: 1R21 HD066230-01A1",,38,16,16,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27.0,10.0,,,,,1450,1483,,10.1002/hec.3780,0,,,34,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29877005.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000443806600007,0

Objectives: The aim of this study was to introduce a general method of accommodating for nonlinear time preferences in discrete choice experiment (DCE) duration studies and to evaluate its impact on estimated QALY tariffs. Methods: A parsimonious utility function is proposed that accommodates any discounting function and preserves linear time preferences as a special case. Based on an efficient DCE design and 1775 respondents from a nationally representative scientific household panel, preferences and QALY tariffs for the Dutch SF-6D were estimated while accommodating for nonlinear time preferences via exponential and hyperbolic discounting functions. Results: When the discount rate was estimated directly, we found strong evidence of nonlinear time preferences (with an exponential and hyperbolic discount rate of 5.7% and 16.5%, respectively). When the discount rate was estimated as a function of health state severity, we found that years lived in better health states are discounted minus years lived in impaired health states. Finally, the best statistical fit was obtained when using a hyperbolic discount function, which resulted in smaller QALY decrements and fewer health states classified as worse than immediate death. Conclusions: Our results highlight the relevance and even necessity of a paradigm shift in health valuation studies in favor of time-preference corrected QALY tariffs, with potentially important implications for health technology assessment calculations and regulatory decisions.","[Jonker, Marcel F.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Jonker, Marcel F.; Donkers, Bas; de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.; Stolk, Elly A.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Choice Modelling Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jonker, Marcel F.; de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Donkers, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Stolk, Elly A.] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Duke University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Jonker, MF (通讯作者)，Duke Clin Res Inst, 2400 Pratt St, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",marcel@mfjonker.com,"Donkers, Bas/B-6082-2008","Donkers, Bas/0000-0002-0412-4276",National Computing Facilities Foundation (NCF) - Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),National Computing Facilities Foundation (NCF) - Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work relied on LISS data that were collected by CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) through its MESS project, and has made use of supercomputer facilities that were sponsored by the National Computing Facilities Foundation (NCF), both of which are funded by The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).

To understand how incentives drive adoption, I study a practice that generates revenue for hospitals: submitting detailed documentation about patients. After a 2008 reform, hospitals could raise their Medicare revenue over 2% by always specifying a patient's type of heart failure. Hospitals only captured around half of this revenue, indicating that large frictions impeded takeup. Exploiting the fact that many doctors practice at multiple hospitals, I find that four-fifths of the dispersion in adoption reflects differences in the ability of hospitals to extract documentation from physicians. A hospital's adoption of coding is robustly correlated with its heart attack survival rate and its use of inexpensive survival-raising care. Hospital-physician integration and electronic medical records are also associated with adoption. These findings highlight the potential for institution-level frictions, including agency conflicts, to explain variations in health care performance across providers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Saturation is described as the point at which no new data is expected to emerge from the conduct of additional qualitative interviews. Study Design: A retrospective evaluation of 26 CE interview studies conducted with patients between 2006 and 2013 was completed to assess the point at which saturation of concept was achieved in each study. Methods: For each of the 26 interview studies, saturation of symptom concepts was assessed by dividing the sample into quartiles and then comparing the number of responses elicited from the first 25% of participants to the next 25% of participants, from the first 50% of participants to the next 25% of participants, and then from the first 75% of participants to the last 25% of participants. The number of interviews required to achieve saturation was documented for each study and then summarized across studies. Results: Findings indicate that 84% of symptom concepts emerged by the 10th interview, 92% emerged by the 15th interview, 97% emerged by the 20th interview, and 99% by the 25th interview. Conclusions: Results provide practical guidance for estimating the number of interviews that may be needed to achieve saturation in a qualitative CE interview study for COA instrument development; address an important gap in qualitative research for the development of COAs in the context of medical product development; and offer useful information for study design and implementation.","[Turner-Bowker, Diane M.; Lamoureux, Roger E.; Stokes, Jonathan; Litcher-Kelly, Leighann; Galipeau, Nina; Yaworsky, Andrew; Shields, Alan L.] Adelphi Values, 290 Congress St, Boston, MA 02210 USA",,"Turner-Bowker, DM (通讯作者)，Adelphi Values, 290 Congress St, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",diane.turner-bowker@adelphivalues.com,,"Turner-Bowker, Diane/0000-0002-8491-5704",Adelphi Values,Adelphi Values,Adelphi Values is the sponsor of this study.,,16,100,116,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,839,842,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.11.014,0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005756.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438314900011,0

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using claims data. PC patients with bone metastasis were identified in the MarketScan Databases between January 1, 2004, and March 1, 2014. The propensity score matching approach was used to match patients with SREs to those without SREs. A pseudo-SRE date was assigned to the control group. We compared 6-month and 12-month total costs of patients between two groups after the SRE or pseudo-SRE date. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US$. Results: We identified 4083 PC men with bone metastasis, from which 787 patients with SREs were matched (1:1) to those without SREs. On average, the total 6-month cost of treating patients with SREs was $43,746 compared with $25,956 in the matched control cohort (P < 0.05). The largest proportion of differences in costs between the two groups was incurred in the first month after the SRE index date or the pseudo-SRE date ($14,979 vs. $4,849; P < 0.05) and was mostly attributable to outpatient visits (43.4%; P < 0.05) and inpatient hospitalization (33.1%; P < 0.05). The total cost per patient over the 12-month period was $22,171 higher among patients with SREs than among patients without SREs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SREs impose considerable burden on health resource utilization for payers. Costs attributable to SREs were substantial. Most costs were incurred in the first month after the occurrence of SREs. Although costs decreased thereafter, they remained significantly higher for patients with SREs in subsequent months compared with patients without SREs.","[Zhong, Yue; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Valderrama, Adriana; Yao, Jianying] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceut Inc, Whippany, NJ USA; [Donga, Prina] IMS Hlth, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Bilir, Pinar] IMS Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA",Tufts Medical Center; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Zhong, Y (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",ugling@gmail.com,,,Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals),This study was funded by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.,,13,8,10,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,304,309,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.02.008,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566837.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428019200009,0

The test relies on a new characterization of equality between two k dimensional symmetric positive-definite matrices A and B: the traces of AB-1 and BA-1 are equal to k if and only if A = B. Using this simple criterion, we introduce a class of omnibus test statistics for equality and examine their null and local alternative approximations under some mild regularity conditions. A preferred test in the class with good omni-directional power is recommended for practical work. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to explore performance characteristics under the null and local as well as fixed alternatives. The test is applicable in many settings, including GMM estimation, SVAR models and high dimensional variance matrix settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although most cannabis products are illegal at the U. S. Federal level, it is legal in 30 states for medical use and 8 states and the District of Columbia for recreational use. Despite the legal issues, cannabis is projected to reach over $31 billion in sales world-wide by 2021. The industry is both rapidly evolving and highly fragmented, making it challenging for companies operating in the space to access the insights and the data to help design communications, product development and branding strategies. The research presented here will show that the application of social media listening can be helpful for cannabis brand marketers to gauge size, scope and nuances of these markets and tailored social media mining can accurately predict a brand's future performance. Later research will show that social media scraping will help identify and segment consumers at a fraction the cost of traditional consumer research methods.","[Kregor, Jennifer; Gomez, Bethany] Brightfield Grp, Chicago, IL 60606 USA; [Kelly, J.

Methods: Instruments identified through a comprehensive literature search were evaluated based on the following criteria: disease specificity, peer-reviewed publication (administered in English in patients with T2D on oral therapy), and availability of psychometric properties. Results: Eight instruments (Diabetes Medication Satisfaction [DiabMedSat]; Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, status version [DTSQs]; Diabetes Medication System Rating Questionnaire [DMSRQ]; Diabetes Medication System Rating Questionnaire Short Form [DMSRQ-SF]; Diabetes Tablet Treatment Questionnaire [DTTQ]; Perceptions About Medications for Diabetes [PAM-D]; Satisfaction with Oral Anti-Diabetic Agent Scale [SOADAS]; Diabetes Medication Satisfaction Tool [DMSAT]) were included in the study based on the predefined inclusion criteria. Seven of the instruments (all but DTTQ) utilized patients in the survey development process. All eight instruments could be completed within 15 minutes and thus were considered practical. DiabMedSat, DMSRQ and DMSRQ-SF encompassed broader aspects of satisfaction than the other instruments. All of the instruments reviewed showed substantial floor or ceiling effects, except for DMSAT and DiabMedSat, without complete information. The DMSRQ and DMSRQ-SF each satisfied the criteria for reliability. DiabMedSat, DTSQs, DMSRQ DMSRQ-SF, SOADAS, and DMSAT showed favorable convergent and discriminant validity. All of the instruments except DTTQ were determined to satisfactorily meet the criteria of responsiveness. Conclusion: Although it is up to researchers to decide which instrument to use according to the resources available and specific aims of their studies, DMSRQ and DSMRQ-SF were recommended based on the evaluative criteria employed in this study.","[Wang, Yu; Perri, Matthew, III] Univ Georgia, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin & Adm Pharm, Room 231,250 W Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Coll Pharm, Dept Clin & Adm Pharm, Room 231,250 W Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",yw08580@uga.edu,,,,,,,48,9,9,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21.0,11.0,,,,,1346,1353,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.001,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442283.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000450111400011,0

To systematically review and summarize the health economics literature published over the last 5 years that describes the economic burden of abuse of prescription opioids. Findings from searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL as well as hand searches of multiple conference abstracts were screened against predefined inclusion criteria to identify studies reporting cost and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) data associated with abuse of prescription opioids. A total of 49 unique studies were identified. Most of the studies examined direct costs and HRU, which were substantially higher for abusers of prescription opioids than non-abuser controls in several matched cohort analyses (US$20,343-US$28,718 vs US$9716-US$14,079 for mean direct combined annual healthcare costs reported in 6 studies). Although only a small number of studies reported indirect costs, these findings suggest a high societal burden related to productivity losses, absenteeism, morbidity, and mortality among those who abuse opioids. Studies of medication-assisted treatment demonstrated that factors such as adherence, dose, formulation (film or tablet), and relapse during treatment, were associated with direct costs and HRU among treated patients. This systematic literature review shows that abuse of prescription opioids is characterized by substantial direct healthcare costs, medical utilization, and related societal costs. Future research should further investigate the indirect costs of opioid abuse.","[Reinhart, Marcia; Patton, Cody; Shak, Nina] Anal Grp Inc, 1010 El Camino Real,Suite 310, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Scarpati, Lauren M.; Kirson, Noam Y.] Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Erensen, Jennifer G.] Purdue Pharma LP, One Stamford Forum,201 Tresser Blvd, Stamford, CT 06901 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Purdue Pharma L.P.,"Kirson, NY (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",noam.kirson@analysisgroup.com,,,Purdue Pharma L.P,Purdue Pharma L.P,"This study was funded by Purdue Pharma L.P.

We define a strategy as super-dominant in a 2 x 2 coordination game if it is the maximin strategy in terms of monetary returns and the state that all players play it constitutes an equilibrium which Pareto-dominates all other equilibria. If such a strategy exists, the corresponding equilibrium, which we call the super-dominant equilibrium, is uniquely stochastically stable for the BRM choice rule (the best response choice rule with uniform random errors) given any model of reference-dependent preferences. However, for any 2 x 2 coordination game with a super-dominant strategy, there exists a model of reference-dependent preferences with which the super-dominant equilibrium fails to be stochastically stable for the logit choice rule.

To date, estimation and evaluation of a risk-adjustment model has been based on statistical rather than economic objective functions. We develop a framework where the objective of risk-adjustment is to minimize the efficiency loss from service-level distortions due to adverse selection, and we use the framework to develop a welfare-grounded method for estimating risk-adjustment weights. We show that when the number of risk adjustor variables exceeds the number of decisions plans make about service allocations, incentives for service-level distortion can always be eliminated via a constrained least-squares regression. When the number of plan service-level allocation decisions exceeds the number of risk-adjusters, the optimal weights can be found by an OLS regression on a straightforward transformation of the data. We illustrate this method with the data used to estimate risk-adjustment payment weights in the Netherlands (N = 16.5 million). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These challenges are especially important to address in oncology in which next-generation tumor sequencing (NGTS) holds a particular promise, guiding the use of life-saving or life-prolonging therapies. Payers' coverage decision making on NGTS is challenging because this revolutionary technology pushes the very boundaries of the underlying framework used in coverage decisions. Some experts have called for the adaptation of the coverage framework to make it better equipped for assessing NGTS. Medicare's recent decision to cover NGTS makes this topic particularly urgent to examine. In this article, we discussed the previously proposed approaches for adaptation of the NGTS coverage framework, highlighted their innovations, and outlined remaining gaps in their ability to assess the features of NGTS. We then compared the three approaches with Medicare's national coverage determination for NGTS and discussed its implications for US private payers as well as for other technologies and clinical areas. We focused on US payers because analyses of coverage approaches and policies in the large and complex US health care system may inform similar efforts in other countries. We concluded that further adaptation of the coverage framework will facilitate a better suited assessment of NGTS and future genomics innovations.","[Trosman, Julia R.; Weldon, Christine B.] Ctr Business Models Healthcare, 972 Green Bay Rd, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Trosman, Julia R.; Weldon, Christine B.; Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Ctr Translat & Policy Res Personalized Med T, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Trosman, Julia R.; Weldon, Christine B.; Gradishar, William J.; Benson, Al B., III; Cristofanilli, Massimo] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Kurian, Allison W.; Ford, James M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Balch, Alan] Patient Advocate Fdn, Hampton, VA USA; [Watkins, John] Premera Blue Cross, Mountlake Terrace, WA USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center,"Trosman, JR (通讯作者)，Ctr Business Models Healthcare, 972 Green Bay Rd, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA.",trosman@centerforbusinessmodels.com,"Weldon, Christine/HMV-6994-2023; Balch, Alan/JXW-7825-2024; Kurian, Allison/A-4560-2019","Weldon, Christine/0000-0003-3918-0048; Ford, James/0000-0002-2513-7025; Kurian, Allison/0000-0002-6175-9470",National Human Genome Research Institute [R01 HG007063]; Guardant Health; Myriad Genetics,National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)); Guardant Health; Myriad Genetics,"J.

Bayesian tools are developed to estimate the model, make related inferences, and perform model selection. To construct efficient posterior sampler for the STI model by an approximation approach, a new algorithm called ALSO (Auxiliary Least Squares Optimization) is introduced, which can quickly make sufficient approximation to a given random variable using Gaussian mixture variables. The posterior sampler takes advantages of the BFGS optimization method to tailor the proposal densities in Metropolis-Hastings chains, and is computationally faster than the existing samplers in literature. Simulation shows that the proposed posterior sampler works well for the STI model. To illustrate the use of the STI model in the real world, we analyze two real high frequency data sets associated with two markets. It is found that the estimated daily tail indexes generally follow a time-varying pattern and tend to fall when large negative events occur. Besides, they significantly drop below 2 during some periods, which implies that the variances of the return distributions during those periods may be infinite, and hence any variance-based risk management for the two markets may be questionable.

Health measures are self-rated health (SRH) and functional limitations; economic status measures are labor income (earnings), family income, and net wealth. We use 3 different types of models: (a) ordinary least squares regression, (b) first-difference, and (c) system-generalized method of moment (GMM). Using ordinary least squares regression and first difference models, we find that higher levels of economic status are associated with better SRH and functional status among both men and women, although declines in income and wealth are associated with a decline in health for men only. Using system-GMM estimators, we find evidence of a causal link from labor income to SRH and functional status for both genders. Among men only, system-GMM results indicate that there is a causal link from net wealth to SRH and functional status. Results overall highlight the need for integrated economic and health policies, and for policies that mitigate the potential adverse health effects of short-term changes in economic status.","[Meraya, Abdulkarim M.; Dwibedi, Nilanjana; Tan, Xi; Sambamoorthi, Usha] West Virginia Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Syst & Policy, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Meraya, Abdulkarim M.] Jazan Univ, Dept Clin Pharm, Fac Pharm, Jazan, Saudi Arabia; [Innes, Kim] West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Morgantown, WV USA; [Mitra, Sophie] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",West Virginia University; Jazan University; West Virginia University; Fordham University,"Meraya, AM (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Syst & Policy, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",ammeraya@mix.wvu.edu,"Meraya, Abdulkarim M./HJH-1965-2023",,National Institute of General Medical Sciences [U54GM104942],National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"The National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Grant/Award Number: U54GM104942",,39,10,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1160,1174,,10.1002/hec.3664,0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29667770.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000437114300002,0

High DAA prices combined with a large number of patients needing treatment may pose substantial economic burden on health systems. Objectives: To examine Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCV infection before and after the availability of new DAAs overall and by state and to also assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on reimbursement for DAAs. Methods: We calculated Medicaid reimbursements for medications for HCV infection between 2012 and 2015 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Outcomes included inflation-adjusted Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCV infection, market share of individual DAAs, percentages of Medicaid outpatient pharmacy reimbursement for DAAs, and Medicaid reimbursement per Medicaid enrollee with HCV infection. Results: Medicaid reimbursement for medications for HCV infection increased from $723 million in 2012 to $2.35 billion in 2015. We found variations in Medicaid reimbursement for DAAs between states in 2014 (up to 7.4 times HCV infection prevalence) that widened in 2015 (0.1-11.4 times HCV infection prevalence). Expansion states had significantly higher increases in reimbursement for DAAs per enrollee with HCV infection compared with non- or late-expansion states ($2178.60; 95% confidence interval $1558.90-$2798.40), controlling for pre-expansion reimbursement. Conclusions: Medicaid reimbursement for DAAs differs across states after controlling for HCV infection prevalence. A third of states contributed more than 5% to 15% of pharmacy reimbursements to DAAs. Medications for HCV infection are only one class of highly priced specialty drugs. Innovative policy strategies are needed for health systems to manage coverage for an increasing number of expensive specialty medications indicated for an increasing number of patients.","[Lu, Christine Y.; Zhang, Fang; Golonski, Nicole; Lupton, Caitlin; Wagner, Anita K.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lu, Christine Y.; Zhang, Fang; Golonski, Nicole; Lupton, Caitlin; Wagner, Anita K.] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jeffrey, Paul] MassHlth Off Clin Affairs, Quincy, MA USA; [Jeffrey, Paul] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Worcester, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard Pilgrim Health Care; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester,"Lu, CY (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Lu, CY (通讯作者)，Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Zhang, Fang/HHN-2153-2022; Wagner, Anita Katharina/HZI-3534-2023","Lu, Christine Y./0000-0002-7550-6837",,,,,45,14,15,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2018,21.0,6.0,,,,,692,697,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.011,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL0GN,29909874.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436646400008,0

Methods: Subjects suffering from chronic health conditions causing daily pain or discomfort were invited to participate in this single-site, single visit, three-way crossover study. Association between individual item and instrument subscale scores was assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and its CI. Participant attitudes toward the use of BYOD in a clinical trial were assessed through use of a questionnaire. Results: In this study, 155 subjects (females 83 [54%]; males 72 [46%]) ages 19 to 69 years (mean +/- SD: 48.6 +/- 13.1) were recruited. High association between the modes of administration (paper, BYOD, site device) was shown with analysis of ICCs (0.79-0.98) for each response scale type, including visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, verbal response scale, and Likert scale. Of the subjects, 94% (146 of 155) stated that they would definitely or probably be willing to download an app onto their own mobile device for a forthcoming clinical trial. Forty-five percent of subjects felt BYOD would be more convenient compared with 15% preferring a provisioned device (40% had no preference). Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence supporting the use of BYOD for PROM collection in terms of the conservation of instrument measurement equivalence across the most widely used response scale types, and high patient acceptance of the approach.","[Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, N Wales, PA USA; [Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England; [Byrom, Bill; Doll, Helen; Muehlhausen, Willie; Flood, Emuella; Cassedy, Cater; Skerritt, Barbara; McCarthy, Marie] ICON Clin Res, Dublin, Ireland; [McDowell, Bryan; Sohn, Jeremy] Nouartis Pharmaceut, Basel, Switzerland; [Hogan, Kyle; Belmont, Ryan] Clin Ink, Winston Salem, NC USA",ICON plc; ICON plc; ICON plc,"Byrom, B (通讯作者)，ICON Clin Res, 3rd Floor Marlow Int, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England.",bill.byrom@iconplc.com,"Muehlhausen, Willie/ABE-1666-2020","Mc Carthy, Marie/0000-0003-2730-0233",,,,,11,26,27,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,581,589,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.008,0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753356.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432175400014,0

Using novel home health data combining provider work logs, personnel data, and detailed patient records, we estimate the effect of provider handoffs-a marker of care discontinuity-on hospital readmissions, an important performance measure for healthcare systems. We use workflow interruption caused by attrition and providers' work inactivity as an instrument for nurse handoffs. We find handoffs to substantially increase hospital readmissions. Our estimates imply that a single handoff increases the likelihood of 30-day hospital readmission by 16 percent and one in four hospitalizations during home health care would be avoided if handoffs were eliminated. Moreover, handoffs are more detrimental for high-severity patients and expedite hospital readmission. The frequency and sequencing of handoffs also affect the likelihood of rehospitalization.

Our framework is very general and allows integrated regressors and trends as well as stationary regressors. The null hypothesis is that breaks in different parameters occur at common locations and are separated by some positive fraction of the sample size unless they occur across different equations. Under the alternative hypothesis, the break dates across parameters are not the same and also need not be separated by a positive fraction of the sample size whether within or across equations. The test considered is the quasi-likelihood ratio test assuming normal errors, though as usual the limit distribution of the test remains valid with non-normal errors. Of independent interest, we provide results about the rate of convergence of the estimates when searching over all possible partitions subject only to the requirement that each regime contains at least as many observations as some positive fraction of the sample size, allowing break dates not separated by a positive fraction of the sample size across equations. Simulations show that the test has good finite sample properties. We also provide an application to issues related to level shifts and persistence for various measures of inflation to illustrate its usefulness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Apparently in real data these two types of noise co-exist. In this paper, we discover a common feature of these two types of noise and propose a unified volatility estimation approach in the presence of both rounding and random noise. Our data-driven method enjoys superior properties in terms of bias and convergence rate. We establish feasible central limit theorems and show their superior performance via simulations. Empirical studies show clear advantages of our method when applied to both stocks data and currency exchange data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, relatively little effort has been paid to the testing of structural changes in panel data models despite their increasing importance in economics and finance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to testing structural changes in panel data models. Unlike the bulk of the literature on structural changes, which focuses on detection of abrupt structural changes, we consider smooth structural changes for which model parameters are unknown deterministic smooth functions of time except for a finite number of time points. We use nonparametric local smoothing method to consistently estimate the smooth changing parameters and develop two consistent tests for smooth structural changes in panel data models. The first test is to check whether all model parameters are stable over time. The second test is to check potential time-varying interaction while allowing for a common trend. Both tests have an asymptotic N(0, 1) distribution under the null hypothesis of parameter constancy and are consistent against a vast class of smooth structural changes as well as abrupt structural breaks with possibly unknown break points alternatives. Simulation studies show that the tests provide reliable inference in finite samples and two empirical examples with respect to a cross-country growth model and a capital structure model are discussed.

Consider an equilibrium equation, Upsilon(k, E) = k of a model where an equilibrium variable (k) is a continuous bounded function of time, real line, and the policy parameter (E) is a locally integrable function of time. The key conditions are time invariance of Upsilon and the requirement that the Fourier transform of the derivative of Upsilon with respect to k does not return unity. Further, in a general constant-returns-to-scale production and homogeneous life-time-utility overlapping generations model we show that the first condition is satisfied at a balanced growth equilibrium and the second condition is satisfied for almost all policies that give rise to such equilibria.

We add interactive fixed effects in the form of a factor structure on the unobserved product characteristics. The interactive fixed effects can be arbitrarily correlated with the observed product characteristics (including price), which accommodate endogeneity and, at the same time, capture strong persistence in market shares across products and markets. We propose a two-step least squares-minimum distance (LS-MD) procedure to calculate the estimator. Our estimator is easy to compute, and Monte Carlo simulations show that it performs well. We consider an empirical illustration to US automobile demand. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Objectives: In this paper we illustrate the potential utility of these methods for finding optimal solutions to problems in health care delivery and policy. To do so, we selected three award-winning papers in health care delivery or policy development, reflecting a range of optimization algorithms. Two of the three papers are reviewed using the ISPOR Constrained Optimization Good Practice Checklist, adapted from the framework presented in the initial Optimization Task Force Report. The first case study illustrates application of linear programming to determine the optimal mix of screening and vaccination strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The second case illustrates application of the Markov Decision Process to find the optimal strategy for treating type 2 diabetes patients for hypercholesterolemia using statins. The third paper (described in Appendix 1) is used as an educational tool. The goal is to describe the characteristics of a radiation therapy optimization problem and then invite the reader to formulate the mathematical model for solving it. This example is particularly interesting because it lends itself to a range of possible models, including linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming formulations. From the case studies presented, we hope the reader will develop an appreciation for the wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods, as well as the variety of methods available. Conclusions: Constrained optimization methods are informative in providing insights to decision makers about optimal target solutions and the magnitude of the loss of benefit or increased costs associated with the ultimate clinical decision or policy choice. Failing to identify a mathematically superior or optimal solution represents a missed opportunity to improve economic efficiency in the delivery of care and clinical outcomes for patients. The ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force's first report provided an introduction to constrained optimization methods to solve important clinical and health policy problems. This report also outlined the relationship of constrained optimization methods relative to traditional health economic modeling, graphically illustrated a simple formulation, and identified some of the major variants of constrained optimization models, such as linear programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic programming. The second report illustrates the application of constrained optimization methods in health care decision making using three case studies. The studies focus on determining optimal screening and vaccination strategies for cervical cancer, optimal statin start times for diabetes, and an educational case to invite the reader to formulate radiation therapy optimization problems. These illustrate a wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods.","[Crown, William] OptumLabs, Boston, MA USA; [Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh] Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sir, Mustafa Y.; Pasupathy, Kalyan S.] Mayo Clin, Hlth Care Policy & Res, Informat & Decis Engn, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, Rochester, MN USA; [Thokala, Praveen] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Alberta Bone & Joint Hlth Inst, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Fac Sci,Fac Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Tosh, Jonathan C.] DRG Abacus, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ijzerman, Maarten J.] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Enschede, Netherlands; [Ijzerman, Maarten J.] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Hlth Econ & Evidence Synth Unit, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Padula, William V.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD USA",Optum; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Mayo Clinic; University of Sheffield; University of Strathclyde; University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Twente; Luxembourg Institute of Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Pasupathy, KS (通讯作者)，Mayo Clin, Clin Engn Learning Labs, Healthcare Policy & Res, Informat & Decis Engn,Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Deli, Rochester, MN 55904 USA.",pasupathyk@mayo.edu,"Padula, Bill/AGB-4625-2022; IJzerman, Maarten/AAB-6894-2020; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./V-3982-2018","IJzerman, Maarten/0000-0001-5788-5805; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./0000-0002-2021-9574",ISPOR,ISPOR,"None of the authors received financial support for their participation in this ISPOR Task Force.

CEAs have relied on list prices that do not reflect the rebates and discounts known to be associated with these purchases. Objectives: To review available cost measures and propose a novel strategy that is transparent, consistent, and applicable to all CEAs taking a US health care sector perspective or a societal payer's perspective. Methods: We propose using the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC), the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (VAFSS), and their midpoint as the upper bound, lower bound, and base case, respectively, to estimate net drug prices for various payers. We compare this approach with wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), the most common measure observed in our literature review. The minimum WAC is used to provide the most conservative comparison. Results: Our sample consists of 1436 brand drugs and 1599 generic drugs. On average, the upper bound (NADAC) is 1% and 9.8% lower than the WAC for brand and generic drugs respectively, whereas the lower bound (VAFSS) is 48.3% and 54.2% lower than the WAC. The NADAC is less than the WAC in 89.6% of drug groups. The distributions of these relationships do not show a clear mode and have wide variation. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the WAC may be an overestimate for the base case because the minimum WAC is higher than the NADAC for most drugs. Our approach balances uncertainty and lack of data for the cost of pharmaceuticals with the need for a transparent and consistent approach for valid CEAs.","[Levy, Joseph] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Rosenberg, Marjorie] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Risk & Insurance, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI USA; [Vanness, David] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Levy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",jlevy1@rx.umaryland.edu,,"Levy, Joseph/0000-0002-9317-5306; Vanness, David/0000-0002-9790-2988",Institutes of Health under Ruth L.

Methods: Thematic analysis of transcripts of a group deliberative exercise carried out as part of two citizens' juries. The exercise was designed to elicit participants' conception of disease severity, and trade-offs between helping small groups with severe conditions and larger groups with less severe conditions. Results: In trading off severity and numbers, all groups were willing to choose a more severely ill but smaller group of patients over a less severely ill but larger group of patients, although how much of a severity differential was required varied between groups. Pain that could not be relieved by alternative means was the strongest motivator for choosing the smaller group. Other symptoms with no alternative means of relief were strong motivators as well. Conclusions: These findings indicate that, all else being equal, the public would support giving priority to a smaller but more severely ill group of patients over a larger group when prioritizing the needs of the few is life-saving, extends life enough to give hope of future improvement, and relieves otherwise intractable symptoms, especially pain.","[Magalhaes, Monica] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, 677 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Exploiting variation in state Medicaid income spend down provisions over time, I find that living in a state with a spend-down provision decreases the prevalence of coresidence with adult children by 1-4 percentage points for single elderly individuals, with a corresponding increase in the use of nursing home care. These findings suggest that changes in Medicaid eligibility for long-term care benefits could have large impacts on living arrangements, care utilization patterns, and Medicaid expenditures.

(2014) in order to construct asymptotically honest (uniform) confidence bands. In particular, we develop an oracle inequality for the conservative Lasso only assuming the existence of a certain number of moments. This is done by means of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality. We allow for heteroskedastic non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Next, we desparsify the conservative Lasso estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of parameters. Our simulations reveal that the desparsified conservative Lasso estimates the parameters more precisely than the desparsified Lasso, has better size properties and produces confidence bands with superior coverage rates.

Methods: The psychometric analysis sample (n = 761) was based on an ongoing, multisite, prospective, noncomparative, longitudinal study of patients undergoing TKA. The PKIP was completed at three study visits: presurgery (visit 1), less than 1 year (visit 3, days 1-303), and minimum 1 year (visit 4, days 304-668). Visit 2 was an operative visit. Supporting outcome measures were collected at each study visit. The PKIP structure and its psychometric properties were assessed as part of a secondary data analysis using an interim data cut before the end of the clinical trial. Results: The PKIP includes four subscales (confidence, stability, activity modification, and satisfaction) and an overall PKIP score. The overall PKIP score met internal consistency (visit 4 = 0.79) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.77) standards. Correlations between the PKIP and other measures (e. g., the American Knee Society score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) provided evidence of construct validity. The PKIP was capable of discriminating between groups of patients with better or worse knee function. The effect size for the overall PKIP score was 2.96 from baseline to visit 4, indicating that the PKIP was highly responsive. Conclusions: The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PKIP support its use among patients undergoing TKA.","[Coles, Theresa; Williams, Valerie; Mordin, Margaret] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Dwyer, Kim] DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruct, Warsaw, IN USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Williams, V (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",vwilliams@rti.org,"Coles, Theresa/ADX-4852-2022","Coles, Theresa/0000-0003-2941-8999; Williams, Valerie/0000-0003-4218-7793; Mordin, Margaret/0000-0002-6048-0275",DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction; RTI Health Solutions,DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction; RTI Health Solutions,"This study was funded by DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction, which provided funding to RTI Health Solutions to plan and conduct all analyses and collaborated with RTI Health Solutions in interpretation of data, the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and approval of the final manuscript.",,36,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21.0,11.0,,,,,1305,1312,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.006,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442278.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000450111400006,0

Objective: To evaluate some predictors of shortages within a large cohort of generic drugs in the United States and to determine the association between drug shortages and changes in generic drug prices. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Outpatient prescription claims from commercial health plans between 2008 and 2014 were analyzed. Seven years of data were divided into fourteen 6-month periods; the first period was designated as the baseline period. The first model estimated the probability of experiencing a drug shortage using drug-specific competition levels, market sizes, formulations (e.g., capsules), and drug prices as predictors. The second model estimated the percentage change in drug prices from baseline on the basis of drug shortage duration. Results: From 1.3 billion prescription claims, a cohort of 1114 generic drugs was identified. Low-priced generic drugs were at a higher risk for drug shortages compared with medium- and high-priced generic drugs, with odds ratios of 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.82) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.52-0.99), respectively. Compared with periods of no shortage, drug shortages lasting less than 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, and at least 18 months had corresponding price increases of 6.0% (95% CI 4.7-7.4), 10.9% (95% CI 8.5-13.4), 14.2% (95% CI 10.6-17.9), and 14.0% (95% CI 9.1-19.2), respectively. Conclusions: Study findings may not be generalizable to drugs that became generic after 2008 or those commonly used in an inpatient setting. The lowest priced drugs are at a substantially elevated risk of experiencing a drug shortage. Periods of drug shortages were associated with modest increases in drug prices.","[Dave, Chintan, V; Pawar, Ajinkya; Brill, Gregory; Kesselheim, Aaron S.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Program Regulat Therapeut & Law PORTAL, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Fox, Erin R.] Univ Utah, Hlth Care Drug Informat Serv, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Dave, CV (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",chintandave19@gmail.com,"Brill, Gregory N/G-4877-2013; Pawar, Ajinkya/AAW-4051-2020; Kesselheim, Aaron/R-6793-2017","Pawar, Ajinkya/0000-0002-8585-9505;",Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Engelberg Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Engelberg Foundation; Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science,The Laura and John Arnold Foundation supported the study.

The licensing policies considered are upfront fees, unit royalties and combinations of fees and royalties (FR policies). It is shown that (i) royalties unambiguously ensure full diffusion of the innovation while diffusion is limited under upfront fees, (ii) the Cournot price is higher under royalties compared to upfront fees and the price could even exceed the post-innovation monopoly price, (iii) for generic values of magnitudes of the innovation, when the industry size is relatively large, royalties are superior to upfront fees for the innovator and (iv) for any m, there is always a non empty subset of m-drastic innovations such that for relatively large industry sizes, upfront fee policy results in higher consumer surplus as well as welfare compared to both royalty and FR policies.

Another tax credit-driven policy, the Health Insurance Tax Credit (HITC), was implemented during 1991-1993. To date, only one paper has analyzed the effectiveness of the HITC on coverage rates. In this paper, I reexamine the effectiveness of the HITC by using the Survey of Income Program Participation and provide the first estimates of its effects on utilization and self-reported health status. Despite using the different data set, I find a similar result regarding coverage as the previous paperthe effect of the HITC was about 5.8 percentage points. I also find that self-reported health was significantly improved because of the HITC. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings on the larger debate regarding current health care reform.","[Jun, Dajung] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Jun, D (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jundajun@msu.edu,,"Jun, Dajung/0000-0001-6097-549X",,,,,10,1,1,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27.0,10.0,,,,,1609,1616,,10.1002/hec.3785,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29920847.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000443806600014,0

Objectives: To examine how dominance tests have been implemented in recent DCE applications in health and discuss their theoretical and empirical interpretation. Methods: Health-related DCEs published in 2015 were reviewed for the inclusion of tests on choice behavior. For studies that implemented a dominance test, information on application and interpretation of the test was extracted. Authors were contacted for test choice sets and observed proportions of subjects who chose the dominated option. Coefficients corresponding to the choice set were extracted to estimate the expected probability of choosing the dominated option with a logistic model and compared with the observed proportion. The theoretical range of expected probabilities of possible dominance tests was calculated. Results: Of 112 health-related DCEs, 49% included at least one test for choice behavior; 28 studies (25%) included a dominance test. The proportion of subjects in each study who chose the dominated option ranged from 0% to 21%. In 46% of the studies, the dominance test led to the exclusion of participants. In the 15 choice sets that were analyzed, 2 had larger proportions of participants choosing the dominated option than expected (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Although dominance tests are frequently applied in DCEs, there is no consensus on how to account for them in data analysis and interpretation. Comparison of expected and observed proportions of participants failing the test might be indicative of DCE quality.","[Tervonen, Tommi; Schmidt-Ott, Tabea; Marsh, Kevin] Evidera, 1 Butterwick,Metro Bldg,6th Floor, London W6 8DL, England; [Schmidt-Ott, Tabea; Quaife, Matthew] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Bridges, John F.

The main result of the paper establishes nonparametric point identification of the joint density of all random coefficients except those on interaction effects. Under additional independence assumptions, we identify the joint density of the interaction coefficients. Moreover, we prove that in the presence of covariates that are common to both players, the player-specific coefficient densities are identified, while the joint density of all random coefficients is not point-identified. However, we do provide bounds on counterfactual probabilities that involve this joint density. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This question has received greater attention in recent years given increasing financial pressures on health systems, leading to different views on how assessment reports and decision-making processes can provide the best structure for considering both elements. In the United States, the advent of explicit value frameworks to guide drug assessments has also focused attention on this issue, driven in part by the prominent inclusion of affordability within the value framework used to guide reports from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. After providing a formal definition of affordability for health care systems, this article argues that, even after using empirical estimates of true health system opportunity cost, cost-effectiveness thresholds cannot by themselves be set in a way that subsumes questions about short-term affordability. The article then presents an analysis of different approaches to integrating cost effectiveness and budget impact assessments within information to guide decision making. The evolution and experience with the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review value framework are highlighted, providing lessons learned and guiding principles for future efforts to bring measures of affordability within the scope of value assessment.","[Pearson, Steven D.] Inst Clin & Econ Review, 2 Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA",,"Pearson, SD (通讯作者)，Inst Clin & Econ Review, 2 Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",spearson@icer-review.org,,,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; California Health Care Foundation; Blue Shield of California Foundation,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; California Health Care Foundation; Blue Shield of California Foundation,"S.

We aim to broaden the view of what constitutes value in health care and to spur new research on incorporating additional elements of value into cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Twelve potential elements of value are considered. Four of them quality-adjusted life-years, net costs, productivity, and adherence-improving factors are conventionally included or considered in value assessments. Eight others, which would be more novel in economic assessments, are defined and discussed: reduction in uncertainty, fear of contagion, insurance value, severity of disease, value of hope, real option value, equity, and scientific spillovers. Most of these are theoretically well understood and available for inclusion in value assessments. The two exceptions are equity and scientific spillover effects, which require more theoretical development and consensus. A number of regulatory authorities around the globe have shown interest in some of these novel elements. Augmenting CEA to consider these additional elements would result in a more comprehensive CEA in line with the impact inventory of the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Possible approaches for valuation and inclusion of these elements include integrating them as part of a net monetary benefit calculation, including elements as attributes in health state descriptions, or using them as criteria in a multicriteria decision analysis. Further research is needed on how best to measure and include them in decision making.","[Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, Polit Sci, Gualala, CA USA; [Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Southern California; University of Pennsylvania; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Rochester; University of Pennsylvania,"Lakdawalla, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",dlakdawa@usc.edu,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,54,271,294,3,94,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,131,139,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.007,0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477390.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-08,WOS:000425894000004,0

Methods: An observational prospective cohort study of adults (>= 18 years) with influenza-like illness in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and South America was conducted. Participants completed the 37-item draft FLU-PRO (c) daily for up to 14 days. Item-level and factor analyses were used to remove items and determine factor structure. Reliability of the final tool was estimated using Cronbach alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients (2-day reliability). Convergent and known groups validity and responsiveness were assessed using global assessments of influenza severity and return to usual health. Results: Of the 536 patients enrolled, 221 influenza-positive subjects comprised the analytical sample. The mean age of the patients was 40.7 years, 60.2% were women, and 59.7% were white. The final 32-item measure has six factors/domains (nose, throat, eyes, chest/respiratory, gastrointestinal, and body/systemic), with a higher order factor representing symptom severity overall (comparative fit index = 0.92; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06). Cronbach alpha was high (total = 0.92; domain range = 0.71-0.87); test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, day 1 day 2) was 0.83 for total scores and 0.57 to 0.79 for domains. Day 1 FLU-PRO (c) domain and total scores were moderately to highly correlated (>= 0.30) with Patient Global Rating of Flu Severity (except nose and throat). Consistent with known-groups validity, scores differentiated severity groups on the basis of global rating (total: F = 57.2, P < 0.001; domains: F = 8.9-67.5, P < 0.001). Subjects reporting return to usual health showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) FLU-PRO score improvement by day 7 than did those who did not, suggesting score responsiveness. Conclusions: Results suggest that FLU-PRO scores are reliable, valid, and responsive to change in influenza-positive adults.","[Powers, John H., III] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Clin Res Directorate, Clin Monitoring Res Program, NCI Campus Frederick, Frederick, MD USA; [Bacci, Elizabeth D.] Evidera, Seattle, WA USA; [Lourdes Guerrero, M.; Ortega-Gallegos, Hilda; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo M.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Memoli, Matthew J.; Han, Alison] NIAID, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.] Madigan Army Med Ctr, Ft Lewis, WA USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.; Chen, Wei-Ju; Burgess, Timothy H.; Millar, Eugene V.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, F Edward Hebert Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, Infect Dis Clin Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.; Chen, Wei-Ju; Lalani, Tahaniyat; Millar, Eugene V.] Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med, Bethesda, MD USA; [Arnold, John C.] Naval Med Ctr, San Diego, CA USA; [Danaher, Patrick J.] Def Inst Med Operat, San Antonio, TX USA; [Lalani, Tahaniyat] Naval Med Ctr, Portsmouth, VA USA; [Ridore, Michelande] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA; [Burgess, Timothy H.] Walter Reed Natl Mil Med Ctr, Bethesda, MD USA; [Hernandez, Andres] Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Zulueta, Patricia] Hosp Gen Dr Manuel Gea Gonzalez, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Pett, Sarah] UCL, London, England; [Pett, Sarah] Univ New South Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fischer, William] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Moreno Macias, Laura] Hosp Gen Agudos JM Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [DuVal, Anna; Rothman, Richard; Dugas, Andrea] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research; Evidera; Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran - Mexico; Evidera; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Madigan Army Medical Center; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA; Henry M.

Firms post wages to attract workers and matches are endogenous. Reducing the wage relative to the wage previously posted is costly to the firm, where the cost is proportional to the size of the proposed cut. Shocks to the firm's profitability may yield an equilibrium wage above what the firm would offer absent proportional adjustment costs. Wage cuts can be partial or full, immediate or delayed, and are non-linear in the shock size. Importantly, wages are sticky even if firms have negligible costs for cutting wages.

Objective: Develop and validate an algorithm using predictive modeling supported by machine learning to identify patients with hemophilia A in an administrative claims database. Methods: We first created a screening algorithm using medical and pharmacy claims to identify potential hemophilia A patients in the US HealthCore Integrated Research Database between January 1, 2006 and April 30, 2015. Medical records for a random sample of patients were reviewed to confirm case status. In this validation sample, we used lasso logistic regression with cross-validation to select covariates in claims data and develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of being a confirmed hemophilia A case. Results: The screening algorithm identified 2,252 patients and we reviewed medical records for 400 of these patients. The screening algorithm had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 65%. The predictive model identified 18 predictors of being a hemophilia A case or noncase. The strongest predictors of case status included male sex, factor VIII therapy, office visits for hemophilia A, and hospitalizations for hemophilia A. The strongest predictors of noncase status included hospitalizations for reasons other than hemophilia A and factor VIIa therapy. A probability threshold of >0.6 resulted in a PPV of 94.7% (95% CI: 92.0-97.5) and sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI: 91.5-97.2). Conclusions: We developed and validated an algorithm to identify hemophilia A cases in an administrative claims database with high sensitivity and high PPV.","[Lyons, Jennifer; Desai, Vibha; Lanes, Stephan] HealthCore, Wilmington, DE USA; [Xu, Yaping; Solari, Paul] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ridgeway, Greg; Finkle, William] Consolidated Res Inc, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ridgeway, Greg] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sullivan, Sean] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Roche Holding; Genentech; University of Pennsylvania; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lyons, J (通讯作者)，300 Brickstone Sq,Suite 801A, Andover, MA 01810 USA.",jglyons@bu.edu,"Ridgeway, Greg/ISS-4420-2023",,Genentech,Genentech(Roche HoldingGenentech),The authors would like to thank Jamileh Jemison for her critical review of this manuscript.

The rarity of the outcome and the treatment was varied across simulation scenarios. Results showed that 2SLS generated consistent estimates of the local average treatment effects (LATE) and biased estimates of the average treatment effects (ATE) across all scenarios. 2SRI approaches, in general, produced biased estimates of both LATE and ATE under all scenarios. 2SRI using generalized residuals minimized the bias in ATE estimates. Use of 2SLS and 2SRI is illustrated in an empirical application estimating the effects of long-term care insurance on a variety of binary health care utilization outcomes among the near-elderly using the Health and Retirement Study.","[Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv & Econ, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Coe, Norma B.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med Ethics & Hlth Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Univ South Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Serv Policy & Management, Columbia, SC USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Pennsylvania; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Basu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Basu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv & Econ, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",basua@uw.edu,,"Coe, Norma/0000-0003-1228-0938; Basu, Anirban/0000-0003-4238-7402","National Institute of Nursing Research [NIH 1R01NR13583]; NIH research [R01CA155329, RC4CA155809]",National Institute of Nursing Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)); NIH research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"National Institute of Nursing Research, Grant/Award Number: NIH 1R01NR13583; NIH research, Grant/Award Numbers: R01CA155329 and RC4CA155809",,31,39,46,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUN,2018,27.0,6.0,,,,,937,955,,10.1002/hec.3647,0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF0UN,29577493.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000431646700003,0

Methods: Participating modeling groups were asked to reproduce the results of two published studies using the input data described in those articles. Gaps in input data were filled with assumptions reported by the modeling groups. Goodness of fit between the results reported in the target studies and the groups' replicated outputs was evaluated using the slope of linear regression line and the coefficient of determination (R-2). After a general discussion of the results, a diabetes-specific checklist for the transparency of model input was developed. Results: Seven groups participated in the transparency challenge. The reporting of key model input parameters in the two studies, including the baseline characteristics of simulated patients, treatment effect and treatment intensification threshold assumptions, treatment effect evolution, prediction of complications and costs data, was inadequately transparent (and often missing altogether). Not surprisingly, goodness of fit was better for the study that reported its input data with more transparency. To improve the transparency in diabetes modeling, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist listing the minimal input data required for reproducibility in most diabetes modeling applications was developed. Conclusions: Transparency of diabetes model inputs is important to the reproducibility and credibility of simulation results. In the Eighth Mount Hood Challenge, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist was developed with the goal of improving the transparency of input data reporting and reproducibility of diabetes simulation model results.","[Palmer, Andrew J.; Si, Lei] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Med Sci 1 Bldg,17 Liverpool St Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Tew, Michelle; Hua, Xinyang; Tran-Duy, An; Clarke, Philip M.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Willis, Michael S.; Asseburg, Christian] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Leal, Jose; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Foos, Volker; Lamotte, Mark] Real World Evidence Solut, IQVIA, Zaventem, Belgium; [Feenstra, Talitha] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Feenstra, Talitha] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Ctr Chron Care Innovat, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Brandle, Michael] Kantonsspital St Gallen, Dept Internal Med, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Smolen, Harry J.; Gahn, James C.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Valentine, William J.; Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland; [Si, Lei; Tew, Michelle; Breeze, Penny; Brennan, Alan; Pollard, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ye, Wen; Isaman, Deanna J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.; Kuo, Shihchen] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Laiteerapong, Neda] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Melbourne; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; University of Oxford; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; University of Groningen; Kantonsspital St. Gallen; Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

This widespread use has been facilitated by legislative and regulatory incentives in both the United States and abroad, yet US payers and health systems have not yet made a concerted effort to understand whether and how rare diseases require special considerations on their part and how to adapt traditional methods of health technology assessment and economic evaluation to accommodate these situations. In this article, we explore the general ethical dilemmas that rare diseases present, steps taken by health technology assessment bodies worldwide to define the level of rarity that would necessitate special measures and the modifications to their assessment and valuation processes needed, and the contextual components for rare-disease evaluation that lie outside of the assessment framework as a guide to US decision makers on constructing a formal and relevant process stateside.","[Ollendorf, Daniel A.; Chapman, Richard H.; Pearson, Steven D.] Inst Clin & Econ Reuiew, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA",,"Ollendorf, DA (通讯作者)，Inst Clin & Econ Reuiew, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",dollendorf@icer-review.org,,,,,,,39,43,44,0,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,547,552,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.008,0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753351.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432175400009,0

COAs that discriminate level of function relative to a normative sample are particularly important in the pediatric rare disease setting because the literature is often void of natural history data. Pediatric rare disease clinical trials will often include a wide age distribution. Gross and fine motor skills, communication, cognition, and independence in activities of daily living vary by age, and it may be difficult to distinguish between treatment effect and change due to developmental maturation. Asfotase alfa was granted breakthrough therapy designation and subsequently approved for the treatment of hypophosphatasia (HPP; a genetic metabolic musculoskeletal disorder) and is used in this discussion to illustrate COA selection in a pediatric rare disease. Multiple COAs with normative data in HPP clinical trials for asfotase alfa are presented. The assessment instruments included the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, handheld dynamometry, the 6-minute walk test, and the Modified Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment-Gait scale. Multiple end points were required to adequately capture the impact of asfotase alfa treatment on the multiple systems affected in HPP. These data illustrate the importance of using multiple COAs that provide normative data and to use COAs early in the drug development process for rare pediatric disease.","[Phillips, Dawn] Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Phillips, Dawn] UNC Div Phys Therapy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Evidera,"Phillips, D (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",Dawn.Phillips@Evidera.com,,,Alexion Pharmaceutical Ltd.,Alexion Pharmaceutical Ltd.,D.

The existing literature typically abstracts from this multiplicity by assuming that the data are generated from a single equilibrium. Instead of imposing such restrictions, this paper provides sufficient conditions to non-parametrically identify payoff primitives in finite action games with incomplete information, while allowing for multiple equilibria. I then propose a two-step estimator and illustrate its finite-sample performances via Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, I study the strategic interaction among radio stations when choosing different time slots to air commercials. I indeed find evidence to support the existence of multiple equilibria.

We test the impact of the reform on treatment quantity and access. We couple data on the near universe of specialty SUD treatment providers in the USA with a synthetic control method approach. We find little evidence that the reform lead to changes in treatment quantity or access. Reform effects were similar among for-profit and non-profit facilities. In an extension, we show that the reform altered the setting in which treatment is received, the number of offered services, and the number of programs for special populations. These findings may be useful in predicting the implications of major health insurance expansions on the provision of SUD treatment.

Because poor health can induce retirement, we instrument for retirement using eligibility for Social Security and employer-sponsored pensions and coverage by the Social Security earnings test. We find strong evidence that retirement improves reported health, mental health, and life satisfaction. In addition, we find evidence of improvements in functional limitations in the long run. Although the impact on life satisfaction occurs within the first 4 years of retirement, many of the improvements in health show up four or more years later, consistent with the view that health is a stock that evolves slowly. We find no evidence that the health improvements are driven by increased health care utilization. In fact, results suggest decreased utilization in some categories.","[Gorry, Aspen; Gorry, Devon] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Slavov, Sita Nataraj] George Mason Univ, Arlington, VA USA",Clemson University; George Mason University,"Gorry, D (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",dgorry@clemson.edu,,"Gorry, Devon/0000-0003-1933-9111",,,,,44,64,77,3,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2018,27.0,12.0,,,,,2067,2086,,10.1002/hec.3821,0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GZ7PM,30141568.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000449674000011,0
