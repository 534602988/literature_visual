This problem, known as the Time Window Assignment Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions, vehicle routes adhering to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage decisions, and the objective is to minimize the expected routing costs. To that end, we develop in this paper a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve the sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic model. From a modeling viewpoint, our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete sets of feasible time window assignments as well as general scenario-based models of uncertainty for several routing specific parameters, including customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint, our approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle routing solver as a black box, and can be readily modified as a heuristic for large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive computational study to demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution methods, as well as to quantify the trade-off between computational tractability and expected cost savings when considering a larger number of future scenarios during strategic time window assignment.

Depending on whether the demand adaptive service is operated along circular or radial transit lines, two variants of such systems are considered: a Circular Model (or C-Model) and a Radial Model (or R-Model). A continuous approximation approach is employed to develop the optimal design problem, which is formulated as a mixed integer program. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal design of the two systems, and a discrete-event simulation is developed to validate the analysis. Numerical and simulation results suggest that the radial route network outperforms the grid route network, which was analyzed previously in the literature, with a significant margin, while the C-Model and R-Model offer similar performance.","[Chen, Peng (Will); Nie, Yu (Marco)] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Nie, Y (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",y-nie@northwestern.edu,"Nie, Yu/B-7083-2009; Nie, Yu/J-6620-2014","Nie, Yu/0000-0003-2083-470X",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1402911],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This project was funded by National Science Foundation under the award number CMMI-1402911.,,42,27,31,4,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

This survey focuses on important principles and key results from CA models. In particular, we consider how these studies fill the gaps identified by the most recent literature reviews in this field. We observe that CA models are used in a wider range of applications, especially in the areas of facility location and integrated supply chain management. Most studies use CA as an alternative and a complement to discrete solution approaches: however, CA can also be used in combination with discrete approaches.

Objective: To compare RA-related treatment, healthcare utilization, and joint erosion between anti-CCP-positive and anti-CCP-negative RA patients. Methods: Newly-diagnosed RA patients were identified from the Henry Ford Health System database between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014; the date of the first RA diagnosis within the study period was the index date. Baseline anti-CCP test was used to categorize patients as anti-CCP-positive or anti-CCP-negative, and outcomes were evaluated in the 6 months post-index. Results: There were 217 anti-CCP-positive and 191 anti-CCP-negative RA patients included in the study. A higher proportion of anti-CCP-positive patients were initiated on RA treatment than anti-CCP-negative patients (70.5% vs 23.0%; p<.0001). More anti-CCP-positive patients received methotrexate (73.2% vs 56.8%; p=.0374), while more anti-CCP-negative patients received hydroxychloroquine (31.8% vs 13.1%; p=.0037) in first-line therapy. A higher proportion of anti-CCP-negative patients were tested for rheumatoid factor (RF) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Of those tested, there were more positive test results in the anti-CCP-positive cohort compared to the anti-CCP-negative cohort (RF: 84.4% vs 18.2%, p<.0001; C-reactive protein [CRP]: 69.7% vs 48.3%, p=.0008; and ESR: 89.5% vs 53.9%, p<.0001). Outpatient utilization predominated, with more anti-CCP-positive patients having any outpatient physician office visit (96.3% vs 77.5%, p<.0001) and a higher mean number of visits (5.3 vs 2.5, p<.0001) than anti-CCP-negative patients. Among anti-CCP-positive (n=113) and anti-CCP-negative (n=58) patients with imaging results, more anti-CCP-positive patients had joint erosion compared to anti-CCP-negative patients (18.6% vs 8.6%; p=.0858); however, statistical significance was not reached. Conclusion: RA patients with positive anti-CCP antibodies had higher degrees of inflammation and disease activity as indicated by laboratory results, which likely contributed to their higher rates of healthcare utilization, joint erosion, and proportions of RA treatment.","[Lamerato, Lois] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Detroit, MI USA; [Price, Kwanza; Szymialis, Rick; Ahmad, Harris] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Eaddy, Michael; Ogbonnaya, Augustina; Shih, Huai-Che] Xcenda LLC, Palm Harbor, FL USA","Henry Ford Health System; Henry Ford Hospital; Bristol-Myers Squibb; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Price, K (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, 3401 Princeton Pike, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",kwanza.price@bms.com,,,"Bristol-Myers Squibb; Xcenda, LLC","Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Xcenda, LLC","This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Methods: A retrospective, observational, matched cohort study used health insurance claims data (January 2008 to June 2013) to assess COPD-related outcomes for subjects aged >= 40 years. Subjects were assigned to a study cohort according to the first observed prescription fill for a long-acting bronchodilator (fluticasone propionate 250 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg [FSC] or tiotropium bromide 18 mcg [TIO]). The analysis period for each subject comprised a 1-year pre-index date and 1-year post-index date. Primary outcome measure was total COPD-related costs per-patient per-year (PPPY) during the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures included COPD-related exacerbations and the components of COPD-related costs. Results: Overall, 24,040 subjects were identified; the analysis sample consisted of 19,090 subjects (9,545 per cohort) with no significant differences between cohorts. Mean COPD-related total costs PPPY were numerically lower among the FSC cohort; however, the difference was not statistically significant ($2,224 [+/- 4,108] vs $2,352 [+/- 3,721], p=.057). There was no difference between cohorts for COPD-related medical costs (p = .894) . COPD-related pharmacy costs were significantly, yet modestly, lower in the FSC cohort compared with the TIO cohort ($1,160 [+/- 1,1061 vs 1,275 [+/- 1,110], p < .001). There were no statistically significant differences in the rate or number of exacerbations between the matched cohorts. Limitations: While propensity scoring achieved balance in baseline characteristics, some residual confounding unobserved in the database may be present. Conclusions: Few clinical and economic differences between subjects initiating maintenance therapy with FSC or TIO were observed.","[Bell, Christopher F.] GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Coutinho, Anna D.; Farrelly, Eileen; Lokhandwala, Tasneem; Landsman-Blumberg, Pamela] Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL USA","GlaxoSmithKline; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Bell, CF (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, US Med Affairs, CEVEO, 5 Moore Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",christopher.f.bell@gsk.com,,"Lokhandwala, Tasneem/0000-0002-1983-9557",GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) [HO-14-14965/201512],GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)(GlaxoSmithKline),This manuscript was funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (HO-14-14965/201512).,,50,0,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: In two US commercial claims databases, patients >= 18 years with >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient GI NET claims within 12 months were identified. The first claim for pharmacologic treatments (e.g. somatostatin analogs [SSAs], cytotoxic chemotherapy [CC], targeted therapy [TT]) following diagnosis, between July 1, 2009-December 31, 2014, was defined as the index date. A 6-month pre-index NET treatment-free period, and >= 1-year post-index enrollment were required. Proportion of days covered {PDC) was calculated during the follow-up period. Outcomes were reported separately for patients with 1- and 2-years post-index enrollment. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and frequencies and percentages for continuous and categorical data, respectively, were reported. Results: Of 1,322 patients with 1-year follow-up, 847 initiated SSA, 397 CC, 35 7, two interferon, and 41 various combinations. Mean (SD) PDC was 0.669 (0.331) for SSA, 0.466 (0.236) for CC, and 0.505 (0.328) for U. Mean (SD) office visits and hospitalizations, respectively, were 20.5 (13.5) and 0.59 (1.03) for SSA, 30.5 (19.8) and 0.89 (1.45) for CC, and 17.7 (12.5) and 1.23 (1.93) for U. Total annual cost for patients during year 1 was $99,691 (82,423) for SSA, $134,912 (116,078) for CC, and $158,397 (82,878) for TT. Among 685 patients with 2-years follow-up, annual mean costs in year 2 were $8,071, $58,944, and $36,248 lower than year 1 for SSA, CC, and TT, respectively. Limitations: Findings may not be generalizable to the US population. Claims are designed for reimbursement, not research. The study may under-estimate costs not covered by insurance. Conclusion: This study reports utilization and costs associated with different treatment therapies. Costs were higher in year 1 than year 2.

Antihypertension therapies guided by single genotypes are clinically more effective and may avert more adverse events than the standard of care of layering anti-hypertensive drug therapies, thus potentially decreasing costs. This study aimed to determine the economic benefits of the implementation of multi-gene panel guided therapies for hypertension from the payer perspective within a 3-year time horizon. Materials and methods: A simulation analysis was conducted for a panel of 10 million insured patients categorized clinically as untreated, treated but uncontrolled, and treated and controlled over a 3-year treatment period. Inputs included research data; empirical data from a 11-gene panel with known functional, heart, blood vessel, and kidney genotypes; and therapy efficacy and safety estimates from literature. Cost estimates were categorized as related to genetic testing, evaluation and management, medication, or adverse events. Results: Multi-gene panel guided therapy yielding savings of $6,256,607,500 for evaluation and management, $908,160,000 for medications, and $37,467,508,716 for adverse events, after accounting for incremental genetic testing costs of $2,355,540,000. This represents total 3-year savings of $42,276,736,216, or a 47% reduction, and 3-year savings of $4,228 and annual savings of $1,409 per covered patient. Conclusions: A precision medicine approach to genetically guided therapy for hypertension patients using a multi-gene panel reduced total 3-year costs by 47%, yielding savings exceeding $42.3 billion in an insured panel of 10 million patients. Importantly, 89% of these savings are generated by averting specific adverse events and, thus, optimizing choice of therapy in function of both safety and efficacy.","[Kelley, Eli F.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Snyder, Eric M.; Snyder, Scott C.; Sprissler, Ryan; Akre, Monica K.] Geneticure Inc, Rochester, MN USA; [Alkhatib, Nimer S.; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & Pharmaco Econ Res, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Sprissler, Ryan] Univ Arizona Genom Core, Tucson, AZ USA; [Sprissler, Ryan; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Ctr Appl Genet & Genom Med, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Olson, Thomas P.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Dept Family & Community Med, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Matrix45, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Mayo Clinic; University of Arizona,"Abraham, I (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon Res, Drachman Hall B306H,1295 N Martin Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",abraham@pharmacy.arizona.edu,"Kelley, Eli/I-6271-2019; Alkhatib, Nimer/GWQ-8515-2022","Alkhatib, Nimer/0000-0001-5071-9257; Kelley, Eli/0000-0001-8337-2253",Geneticure Inc.,Geneticure Inc.,"The study was supported by funds from Geneticure Inc., which has developed multi-gene panels for blood pressure prescribing using pharmacogenetics.

Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness using two different agents for hemostasis (HEMOPATCH vs dry or wet gauze compression or similar SOC) in cardiac surgery from the European hospital perspective. Methods: A literature-based cost-effectiveness model estimating average cost per successful hemostasis event was developed based on the hemostasis efficacy difference (HEMOPATCH=97.6%, SOC=65.8%, p<.001). Additional clinically significant end-points studied in the trial (blood transfusions and surgical revisions) were also analyzed. It was assumed that each surgery utilized two units of HEMOPATCH (dimensions of 4.5x9cm) and two units of SOC. Product acquisition costs for HEMOPATCH and SOC were included along with outcome-related costs derived from the literature and inflation-adjusted to 2017 EUR and GBP. Results are presented for an average hospital with an annual case load of 574 cardiac surgeries. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Considering only product acquisition cost, HEMOPATCH had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)1,659, (sic)1,519, (sic)1,623, and (sic) 1,725 per hemostasis success when compared to SOC for Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, respectively. However, when considering the cost and potential difference in the frequency of transfusions and revisions compared to SOC, the use of HEMOPATCH was associated with an annual reduction of six revisions and 60 transfusions, improving the ICER to (sic)1,440, (sic)1,222, (sic)1,461, and (sic) 1,592, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated model robustness. Conclusions: This analysis supports the use of HEMOPATCH over SOC in cardiac surgery in European hospitals to improve hemostasis success rates and potential cost offsets from reduced transfusions, complications, and surgical revisions.","[Ikeme, Shelly; Lewis, Kevin M.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Weltert, Luca] European Hosp, Rome, Italy; [Bothma, Gerhard; Kuntze, Erik] Baxter Healthcare Corp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cianciulli, Daniela] Baxter Healthcare Corp, Rome, Italy; [Pay, Nicole; Epstein, Josh] Stratevi, Santa Monica, CA USA",Baxter International Inc,"Ikeme, S (通讯作者)，Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA.",shelly_ikeme@baxter.com,,,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,This study was funded by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,31,7,7,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: An observational study assessed infusion time including: clinic visit duration, RA medication preparation and infusion time, and infusion process time. Satisfaction was assessed by a modified Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (patient) and study-specific questionnaires (patient and clinic personnel). Comparative statistical testing for patient data utilized analysis of variance for continuous measures, and Fisher's exact or Chi-square test for categorical measures. Multivariate analysis was performed for the primary time endpoints and patient satisfaction. Results: One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled from six US sites (72 GLM-IV, 78 IFX). The majority of patients were female (80.0%) and Caucasian (88.7%). GLM-IV required fewer vials per infusion (3.7) compared to IFX (4.9; p = .0001). Clinic visit duration (minutes) was shorter for GLM-IV (65.1) compared to IFX (153.1; p < .0001), as was total infusion time for RA medication (32.8 GLM-IV, 119.5 IFX; p < .0001) and infusion process times (45.8 GLM-IV, 134.1 IFX; p < .0001). Patients treated with GLM-IV reported higher satisfaction ratings with infusion time (p < .0001) and total visit time (p = .0003). Clink personnel reported higher satisfaction with GLM-IV than IFX specific to medication preparation time, ease of mixing RA medication, frequency of patients requiring pre-medication, and infusion time. Limitations: Findings may not be representative of care delivery for all RA infusion practices or RA patients. Conclusions: Shorter overall clinic visit duration, infusion process, and RA medication infusion times were observed for GLM-IV compared to IFX. A shorter duration in infusion time was associated with higher patient and clinic personnel satisfaction ratings.","[Daniel, Shoshana R.; McDermott, John D., Jr.] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Le, Cathy] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, San Diego, CA USA; [Pierce, Christine A.] Resource Grp, Richfield, OH USA; [Ziskind, Michael A.] Janssen Biotechnol Inc, Horsham, PA USA; [Ellis, Lorie A.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Horsham, PA USA",Covance; Covance; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Ellis, LA (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 800 Ridgeview Dr, Horsham, PA 19044 USA.",lellis@its.jnj.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Covance Market Access Services, Inc.","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Covance Market Access Services, Inc.","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC sponsored the study, and Covance Market Access Services, Inc. received funding for the research and manuscript development.",,16,6,6,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

HRV testing could be combined with putative ANS biologic pathways to improve treatment response for RA patients. This study explored potential costs and health outcomes of introducing HRV testing into RA treatment, without and with ANS optimization. Methods: A decision tree exploratory economic model compared HRV testing to standard care in moderate-to-severe biologic-eligible patients over a 10-year time horizon. HRV data was derived from an observational study of RA patients (n=33). Patients were stratified into treatment groups based on HRV test scores indicating low probability of response and moderate to high probability of response. This study explored adding ANS optimization based on HRV score followed by clinically-appropriate treatment. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the US population were estimated. Results: HRV testing in biologic-eligible patients decreased non-effective biologic use, reducing US healthcare costs by $34.6 billion over 10 years with QALYs unchanged. When combined with ANS optimization in biologic-eligible patients, HRV testing could increase costs by $3.6 billion over 10 years but save over 350,000 QALYs. Among all RA patients, HRV testing with ANS optimization could save over $8 billion and over 100,000 QALYs over 10 years, depending on the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HRV test. Conclusions: The potential economic impact of introducing HRV testing and ANS optimization into RA treatment appears substantial and cost-effective based on the exploratory analysis. Additional rigorous studies are warranted in larger patient samples to better inform decision-making.","[Zimmermann, Marita; Vodicka, Elisabeth; Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Global Hlth LLC, Seattle, WA USA; [Holman, Andrew J.] Inmedix LLC, Seattle, WA USA",,"Zimmermann, M (通讯作者)，1523B NW 64th St, Seattle, WA 98107 USA.",marita@cghllc.org,,,"Inmedix, Inc.","Inmedix, Inc.","This study was funded by Inmedix, Inc.",,54,4,6,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Although their durations are often set arbitrarily, we sought to establish data-driven phases of care using joinpoint regression in an advanced melanoma population as a case example. Methods: A retrospective claims database study was conducted to assess the costs of advanced melanoma from distant metastasis diagnosis to death during January 2010-September 2014. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied to identify the best-fitting points, where statistically significant changes in the trend of average monthly costs occurred. To identify the initial phase, average monthly costs were modeled from metastasis diagnosis to death; and were modeled backward from death to metastasis diagnosis for the terminal phase. Points of monthly cost trend inflection denoted ending and starting points. The months between represented the interim phase. Results: A total of 1,671 patients with advanced melanoma who died met the eligibility criteria. Initial phase was identified as the 5-month period starting with diagnosis of metastasis, after which there was a sharp, significant decline in monthly cost trend (monthly percent change [MPC]=-13.0%; 95% CI=-16.9% to -8.8%). Terminal phase was defined as the 5-month period before death (MPC=-14.0%; 95% CI=-17.6% to -10.2%). Limitations: The claims-based algorithm may under-estimate patients due to misclassifications, and may over-estimate terminal phase costs because hospital and emergency visits were used as a death proxy. Also, recently approved therapies were not included, which may under-estimate advanced melanoma costs. Conclusions: In this advanced melanoma population, optimal duration of the initial and terminal phases of care was 5 months immediately after diagnosis of metastasis and before death, respectively. Joinpoint regression can be used to provide data-supported phase of cancer care durations, but should be combined with clinical judgement.","[Atkins, Michael] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Coutinho, Anna D.; Eaddy, Michael] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Nunna, Sasikiran] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA; [Gupte-Singh, Komal] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ USA","Georgetown University; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; University of Mississippi; Bristol-Myers Squibb","Coutinho, AD (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",anna.coutinho@xcenda.com,"Nunna, Sasikiran/AAR-3948-2020","Nunna, Sasikiran/0000-0002-8006-7306",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,16,2,4,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A targeted literature search was conducted for 1990-2016, including data gathered from members of the World Self-Medication Industry and searches on PubMed, EBSCOHost, and Google Scholar. Specific searches of individual drug classes known to be switched to non-prescription status in this period were also conducted. Results: A total of 71 articles were identified, of which 17 (11 modeling studies, six retrospective analyses) were included in the review. Evidence from modeling studies and retrospective analyses of grouped data across a range of common conditions for which non-prescription medications are available in different countries/regions showed that the use of non-prescription products for the treatment of common conditions or for symptom management (e.g. allergies, chronic pain, migraine, vaginitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, or common cold symptoms) had considerable value to patients, payers, and employers alike in terms of cost savings and improved productivity. Potential benefits of self-medication were also identified in preventative healthcare strategies, such as those for cardiovascular health and osteoporosis. Limitations: This review was limited by a targeted, but non-systematic approach to literature retrieval, as well as the inclusion of unpublished reports/white papers and patient self-reported data. Conclusions: The evidence identified in this literature review shows that responsible, appropriate self-medication with non-prescription products can provide significant economic benefits for patients, employers, and healthcare systems worldwide.","[Noone, Joshua; Blanchette, Christopher M.] Precis Hlth Econ, 16740 Birkdale Commons Pkwy,Suite 200, Huntersville, NC 28078 USA; [Blanchette, Christopher M.] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Noone, J (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 16740 Birkdale Commons Pkwy,Suite 200, Huntersville, NC 28078 USA.",josh.noone@precisionhealtheconomics.com,,,World Self-Medication Industry,World Self-Medication Industry,Funding was provided by the World Self-Medication Industry.,,37,60,62,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: The cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from a third-party payer perspective in the US and was implemented using a partitioned survival model with health states for first-line treatment (progression-free), disease progression with and without subsequent active treatment, and death. Survival analyses of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC from the PEAK head-to-head clinical trial of panitumumab vs bevacizumab were performed to estimate time in the model health states. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities related to mCRC treatment. Literature and US public data sources were used to estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent active therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials in the first-, second-, and third-line settings. A life-time perspective was taken with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Compared with bevacizumab, the use of panitumumab resulted in an incremental cost of US $60,286, and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.445, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US $135,391 in favor of panitumumab. Results were sensitive to wastage and dose rounding assumptions modeled. Limitations: Progression-free and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Costs and quality of life were estimated from multiple and different data sources.

We find using suitable transformations that only a single network parameter is required to characterize the DUE solution, the freeway to NMFD capacity ratio. We also show that the stability and convergence properties of this system are captured by the constant demand case, which corresponds to an autonomous dynamical system that admits analytical solutions. This solution is characterized by two critical accumulation values that determine if the steady state is in free-flow or gridlock, depending on the initial accumulation. Additionally, we also propose a continuum approximation to account for the spatial evolution of congestion, by including variable trip length and variable NMFD coverage area in the model. It is found that gridlock cannot happen and that the steady-state solution is independent of surface network parameters. These parameters do affect the rate of convergence to the steady-state solution, but convergence rates appear virtually identical when time is expressed in units of the NMFD free-flow travel time.

With advances in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, CAV trajectories not only provide more information than existing infrastructure-based detection systems, but also can be controlled to further improve mobility and sustainability. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories and traffic signals in a unified framework at isolated signalized intersections in a CAV environment. A new planning horizon strategy is applied to conduct the optimization. All vehicle movements such as left-turning, right turning and through are considered. Phase sequences, green start and duration of each phase, and cycle lengths are optimized together with vehicle lane-changing behaviors and vehicle arrival times for delay minimization. Vehicles are split into platoons and are guaranteed to pass through the intersection at desired speeds and avoid stops at stop bars. Exact vehicle trajectories are determined based on optimized vehicle arrival times. For the trajectory planning of platoon leading vehicles, an optimal control model is implemented to minimize fuel consumption/emission. For following vehicles in a platoon, Newell's car following model is applied. Simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed control method over vehicle-actuated control in terms of intersection capacity, vehicle delays, and CO2 emissions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the potential benefits of a short minimum green duration as well as the impacts of no-changing zones on the optimality of the proposed model.

In such scenarios, assuming that network arcs exist in a finite number of states with different delay functions with different probabilities, a marginal cost pricing scheme that leads to a socially optimal outcome is proposed. The suggested framework makes the behavioral assumption that travelers do not just choose paths but follow routing policies that respond to en route information. Specifically, it is assumed that travelers are fully-rational and that they compute the optimal online shortest path assuming full reset. However, such policies may involve cycling, which is unrealistic in practice. Hence, a network transformation that helps restrict cycles up to a certain length is devised and the problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem with symmetric delay functions. The results of numerical tests on the Sioux Falls test network are presented using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Methods: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises on preventive treatment, off preventive treatment, and death health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated. Results: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine. Conclusion: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC.","[Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Brennan, Alan] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Porter, Joshua K.; Villa, Guillermo] Amgen Europe GmbH, Econ Modeling Ctr Excellence, Global Hlth Econ, Zug, Switzerland; [Sapra, Sandhya; Shah, Neel] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Tepper, Stewart] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol, 1 Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Dodick, David] Mayo Clin, Scottsdale, AZ USA",Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; University of Sheffield; University of York - UK; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen; Dartmouth College; Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic Phoenix,"Lipton, RB (通讯作者)，Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",richard.lipton@einstein.yu.edu,"Lipton, Richard B/B-5060-2011; Lipton, Richard Bruce/AAY-2818-2021; Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009","Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),The study was funded by Amgen Inc.,,45,35,35,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A passenger rail agency negotiates with the host freight railroad to determine train schedules and the associated payment. The objective on the passenger side is to maximize utility, i.e., revenue minus costs of passenger train operations, passenger schedule delay and en-route delay; the freight side minimizes the costs of train departure delay, en-route delay, loss of demand, and track maintenance. Bargaining in both complete and incomplete information settings are considered; the latter arises because the freight railroad may withhold its private cost information. With complete information, we find that the equilibrium payments proposed by the passenger rail agency and the host freight railroad will each be invariant to who initiates the payment bargaining, although the actual payment does depend on who is the initiator. The equilibrium schedule maximizes system welfare. With incomplete information, the passenger rail agency may choose between pooling and separating equilibrium strategies while proposing a payment, depending on its prior belief about the cost type of the freight railroad; whereas the host freight railroad will adopt strategies that do not reveal its cost type. To identify equilibrium schedules, a pooling equilibrium is constructed along with conditions for the existence of equilibrium schedules. We further conduct numerical experiments to obtain additional policy-relevant insights. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess the economic burden of hyperprolactinemia, and to compare its risk among adult patients using atypical antipsychotics (AAs) with a mechanism of action associated with no/low vs high/moderate prolactin elevation. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was based on US Commercial and Medicaid claims databases. Healthcare costs were compared between matched hyperprolactinemia and hyperprolactinemia-free cohorts using a two-part model. Risk of hyperprolactinemia was compared between patients receiving AAs with a mechanism of action associated with no/low (no/low prolactin elevation cohort) vs high/moderate prolactin elevation (high/moderate prolactin cohort) using logistic regression. Results: In the commercially insured sample, compared to the hyperprolactinemia-free cohort (n = 499), the hyperprolactinemia cohort (n = 499) was associated with incremental total healthcare costs of $5,732 ($20,081 vs $14,349; p = .004), and incremental medical costs of $3,861 ($13,218 vs $9,357; p = .040), mainly driven by hyperprolactinemia-related costs. In the Medicaid-insured sample, compared to the hyperprolactinemia-free cohort, the hyperprolactinemia cohort was associated with incremental total healthcare costs of $10,773 ($30,763 vs $19,990; p = .004), and incremental medical costs of $9,246 ($20,859 vs $11,613; p = .004), mainly driven by hyperprolactinemia-related and mental health-related costs. The odds of hyperprolactinemia in the no/low prolactin elevation cohort were 4-5-times lower than that in the high/moderate prolactin elevation cohort (odds ratio =0.21; p < .001). Limitations: Hyperprolactinemia may be under-reported in claims data. Conclusions: Hyperprolactinemia is associated with substantial healthcare costs. AAs associated with no/low prolactin elevation reduce the risk of hyperprolactinemia by 4-5-times compared to AAs associated with moderate/high prolactin elevation. Treatment options with minimal impact on prolactin levels may contribute to reducing hyperprolactinemia burden in AA-treated patients.","[Cloutier, Martin; Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Patrick; Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Greene, Mallik] Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Touya, Maelys] Lundbeck, Deerfield, IL USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Otsuka Pharmaceutical,"Greene, M (通讯作者)，Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 508 Carnegie Ctr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mallik.greene@otsuka-us.com,,,"Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Lundbeck, LLC","Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Lundbeck, LLC","This research was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lundbeck, LLC.

In this problem, a set of restoration crews are dispatched from depots to a road network to restore the disrupted infrastructure network. Two mathematical formulations are presented to scheduling and sequencing disrupted network components to restoration crews and route the crews towards disrupted components to maximize network resilience progress in any given time horizon. In the first formulation, the number of restoration crews assigned to each disrupted component, the arrival time of each assigned crew to each disrupted component and consequently the restoration rate associated with each disrupted component are considered as variables to increase the flexibility of the model in the presence of different disruptive events. Along with the contributions applies in the first formulation, in the second formulation, each disrupted component can be partially active during its restoration process. To find the coordinated routes, we propose a relaxed mixed integer program as well as a set of valid inequalities which relates the planning and scheduling efforts to decision makers policies. The integration of the relaxed formulation and valid inequalities results in a lower bound for the original formulations. We further introduce a feasibility algorithm to derive a strong initial solution for the routing restorative capacity problem.

Materials and methods: IQVIA PharMetrics Plus administrative claims data were linked with Modernizing Medicine Data Services Electronic Health Record data and used to select adult psoriasis patients between April 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014. Eligible patients were classified by disease severity (mild, moderate, severe) using a hierarchy of available clinical measures. One-year outcomes included all-cause and psoriasis-related outpatient, emergency department, inpatient, and pharmacy HCRU and costs. Results: This study identified 2,130 biologic-treated psoriasis patients: 282 (13%) had mild, 116 (5%) moderate, and 49 (2%) severe disease; 1,683 (79%) could not be classified. The mean age was 47.6 years; 45.4% were female. Relative to mild psoriasis patients, patients with moderate or severe disease had more median all-cause outpatient encounters (28.0 [mild] vs 32.0 [moderate], 36.0 [severe]), more median psoriasis-related outpatient encounters (6.0 [mild] vs 7.5 [moderate], 8.0 [severe]), and a higher proportion of overall claims for medications that were psoriasis-related (28% [mild] vs 37% [moderate], 34% [severe]). Relative to mild psoriasis patients, patients with moderate or severe disease had higher median all-cause total costs ($37.7k [mild] vs $42.3k [moderate], $49.3k [severe]), higher median psoriasis-related total costs ($32.7k [mild] vs $34.9k [moderate], $40.5k [severe]), higher median all-cause pharmacy costs ($33.9k [mild] vs $36.5k [moderate], $36.4k [severe]), and higher median psoriasis-related pharmacy costs ($32.2k [mild] vs $33.9k [moderate], $35.6k [severe]). Limitations: The assessment of psoriasis disease severity may not have necessarily coincided with the timing of biologic use. The definition of disease severity prevented the assessment of temporality, and may have introduced selection bias. Conclusions: Biologic-treated patients with moderate or severe psoriasis cost the healthcare system more than patients with mild psoriasis, primarily driven by higher pharmacy costs and more outpatient encounters.","[Murage, Mwangi J.; Ojeh, Clement K.; Muram, Talia M.; Araujo, Andre B.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA; [Anderson, Amanda; Oliveria, Susan A.; Casso, Deborah] IQVIA, Epidemiol & Drug Safety, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Merola, Joseph F.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA USA",Eli Lilly; IQVIA; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Murage, MJ (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, GPORWE, LCT South Bldg 172-2,Drop Code 5028, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA.",murage_mwangi_james@lilly.com,"Muram, Talia/AAC-1208-2022","Merola, Joseph/0000-0001-6514-4353",Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly),Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly),"This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly).

The stability properties of the CTM under different demand and capacity constraints are not always obvious. In addition, the impact of microscopic phenomena such as forced lane changes at bottlenecks leading to capacity drop is not captured by the CTM. In this paper, we start with a single section and modify the CTM to account for capacity drop. We analyze the stability properties of the CTM under all possible demand and capacity constraints as well as all possible initial density conditions. The analysis is used to motivate the design of variable speed limit (VSL) control to overcome capacity drop and achieve the maximum possible flow under all feasible traffic situations. The results are extended to multiple sections, where the stability properties of the open-loop system are analyzed and a VSL control scheme is designed and shown to achieve the objective of maximizing the traffic flow under different demand and capacity constraints. Unlike the open loop system where an infinite number of equilibrium points exist under certain demand levels, the proposed nonlinear VSL scheme guarantees exponential convergence to a unique equilibrium point that corresponds to maximum possible flow and speed under all possible demand levels and capacity constraints.

The Association of British Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Materials and methods: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression. Cladribine tablets had a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses tested. The greatest influence on results was the treatment effect on disability progression derived from the ITC. Limitations: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT beyond trial durations. In line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the network meta-analysis informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with a degree of uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken. Conclusions: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab and natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in England.","[Hettle, Robert] Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel Int, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Harty, Gerard] MERCK, Feltham, England; [Wong, Schiffon L.] EMD Serono Inc, Billerica, MA USA",Parexel International; Merck & Company; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.,"Harty, G (通讯作者)，Global Evidence & Value Dev, 45A Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821 USA.",gerard.harty@emdserono.com,,,"EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","Editorial assistance was provided by Jo Whelan (Textpharm Ltd., Oxford, UK) funded by EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.",,51,25,25,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: Adults with MDD and antidepressant treatment (ADT) who newly initiated adjunctive aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, lurasidone, or quetiapine between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 were identified in the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims database; the index date was the date of the first AAP claim. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: AAP initiated in the first year (Y1); in the second year (Y2); and more than 2 years (Y3) of first ADT use. Within each cohort, HRU and costs were compared between the 12 months before and after the index date. Pre-post changes in HRU and costs were then compared between cohorts. Results: Five hundred and six (36.7%) patients were categorized as Y1; 252 (18.3%) as Y2; and 622 (45.1%) as Y3. AAP use was associated with significantly decreased rates of all-cause and MDD-related hospitalization and emergency department visits, and increased rates of pharmacy fills and physician office visits; and the magnitude of changes was largest in cohort Y1. Cohort Y1 had the largest reductions in mean (SD) all-cause medical costs per patient (-$10,496 +/-$85,022, p=.015) compared to Y2 (-$2,474 +/-$85,022, p=.572) and Y3 (-$472 +/-$31,334, p=.823), mainly due to the reduction in hospitalization. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the largest reductions in hospitalization and medical costs were observed in cohort Y1. Similar increases in all-cause pharmacy costs were seen in all cohorts. A similar trend in costs was observed in MDD-related healthcare services. Limitations and conclusions: AAP treatment was associated with reductions in all-cause and MDD-related medical costs, primarily in decreased hospitalization. The reductions were largest among patients who initiated treatment in the first year.","[Seetasith, Arpamas; Burudpakdee, Chakkarin] IQVIA, Fairfax, VA USA; [Greene, Mallik] Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Princeton, NJ USA; [Hartry, Ann] Lundbeck, Deerfield, IL USA",IQVIA; Otsuka Pharmaceutical,"Greene, M (通讯作者)，Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 508 Carnegie Ctr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mallik.greene@otsuka-us.com,"Burudpakdee, Chakkarin/AAE-7316-2019",,"Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc; Lundbeck, USA","Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc(Otsuka Pharmaceutical); Lundbeck, USA","This study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc and Lundbeck, USA.

Hispanic Americans have one of the lowest rates of PHI coverage. The largest group in the US Hispanic population are Mexican Americans; they account for about two in every three Hispanics. One in every three Mexican Americans aged 64 years and under did not have health insurance coverage. Mexican Americans have the most unfavorable health insurance coverage of any population group in the nation. Objectives: The objective is to determine the factors associated with the gap in PHI coverage between Mexican American and non-Hispanic American men. Methods: This study used the National Health Interview Surveys (2010-2013) as the sample. A non-linear Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was run, estimating the explained and unexplained gap in PHI coverage between the groups. Several robustness tests of the model were also included. Results: This study estimates that 44.4% of employed Mexican American men are covered by PHI compared to 79.5% of non-Hispanic American men. Nearly 60% of employed Mexican American men were found to be foreign born, 35% have an educational attainment less than a high school degree, and 40% are likely to have language barriers. Decomposition results show that income, low educational attainment, being foreign-born, and language barriers diminished the probability of private health insurance coverage for Mexican Americans, and that 10% of the gap is unexplained. Conclusions: Most of the difference in the PHI rate between Mexican American men and non-Hispanic men is explained by observable differences in group characteristics: education, language, and immigration status. About 10% of the difference can be attributed to discrimination under the traditional interpretation of an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The PHI rate gap is large and persistent for Mexican American men.","[van der Goes, David N.; Santos, Richard] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 Univ New Mexico MSC05-3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"van der Goes, DN (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 Univ New Mexico MSC05-3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",dvandergoes@unm.edu,,,,,,,16,3,5,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, using the American Diabetes Association definition of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (SMPG 3.9mmol/L) the rate was comparable between the two treatments (rate ratio=1.07 [95% CI=0.90-1.28]).Limitations: The assumptions made in the indirect comparison and differences between the included trials in baseline HbA(1c) levels, previous use of sulfonylureas, definitions of hypoglycemia, presence or absence of run-in period, the different duration of the trials, and the cross-over design of one of the trials.Conclusions: The results of this indirect treatment comparison demonstrate that, among patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin, treatment with IDegLira results in a greater reduction of HbA(1c) and a greater reduction in body weight compared with iGlarLixi at similar insulin doses.","[Evans, Marc] Univ Hosp Llandough, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Billings, Liana K.] NorthShore Univ HealthSyst, Evanston, IL USA; [Billings, Liana K.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hakan-Bloch, Jonas; Slothuus, Ulla; Abrahamsen, Trine J.; Andersen, Andreas] Novo Nordisk AS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jansen, Jeroen P.] Precis Hlth Econ, Oakland, CA USA",NorthShore University Health System; University of Chicago; Novo Nordisk,"Evans, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Llandough, Penlan Rd, Penarth CF64 2XX, S Glam, Wales.",marclyndon1@hotmail.com,,"Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217","Novo Nordisk A/S, Soborg, Copenhagen, Denmark; Novo Nordisk","Novo Nordisk A/S, Soborg, Copenhagen, Denmark; Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation)","Sponsorship for this study and article publication fees were funded by Novo Nordisk A/S, Soborg, Copenhagen, Denmark.

The source of uncertainty is heterogeneity in driving behavior, captured using driver specific speed-spacing relations, i.e., parametric uncertainty. It also results in smooth vehicle trajectories in a stochastic context, which is in agreement with real-world traffic dynamics and, thereby, overcoming issues with aggressive oscillation typically observed in sample paths of stochastic traffic flow models. We utilize ensemble filtering techniques for data assimilation (traffic state estimation), but derive the mean and covariance dynamics as the ensemble sizes go to infinity, thereby bypassing the need to sample from the parameter distributions while estimating the traffic states. As a result, the estimation algorithm is just a standard Kalman-Bucy algorithm, which renders the proposed approach amenable to real-time applications using recursive data. Data assimilation examples are performed and our results indicate good agreement with out-of-sample data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, such parameters as 'type', 'time of day', 'duration', 'location', 'companionship', and etc. are defining factors in quantifying the utility of activities - a challenging problem which has been the focus of research for many years. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the parameters of utility distributions for joint and solo activities, along with the penalty values associated with the deviation of activity start time and duration from their modal values. The study utilizes travel survey data collected in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, over the period of six weeks in 2003. The proposed model is a bi-level optimization model, where the upper level maximizes the accuracy of the activity scheduling on the aggregate level and is measured using the outputs of lower level optimization models. Each lower level model is a variation of pickup and delivery problem and schedules activities for each individual in the population using the parameters of utility distribution and penalty values generated by the Genetic Algorithm. The results indicate that travelers are trying to be more consistent with their arrival time to work, school and pickup/drop off activities: the associated penalty values for deviation from the modal value for arrival time to work and school activities are high. Additionally, significant differences in the parameters of the estimated utility distribution for joint and solo activities are observed, reflecting the fact that utility gained from joint and solo activities are different and needs more in-depth investigation. The proposed methodology has the potential to be applied to any multiday travel survey data, which due to advances made in handheld smart devices and mobile applications are becoming more convenient to collect.

Methods: We used data from Truven's MarketScan databases from 1 July 2011 through 31 December 2015. Patients aged 18 or older were diagnosed with hypothyroidism (confirmed at least twice) and prescribed LT4. Patients were excluded if they did not have continuous insurance coverage or if they received a diagnosis of thyroid cancer or pregnancy during the study period. Multivariable analyses on a matched cohort of adherent and nonadherent patients examined the relationships among patient outcomes and adherence, defined as the proportion of days covered 80%. Outcomes included all-cause and hypothyroidism-related medical costs and resource utilization and comorbid diagnoses measured over the 1 year post-period following the first prescription for LT4. The analyses controlled for patient age, sex, region of residence, type of insurance coverage, diagnosing physician and pre-period general health status as proxied by the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results: Prior to matching, there were 168,457 patients identified as adherent and 198,443 patients identified as nonadherent. The matched cohort consisted of 318,628 individuals, with equal numbers of adherent and nonadherent patients (n=159,314). Patients who were adherent used significantly fewer resources and had significantly lower all-cause ($14,136 vs. $14,926; p<.0001) and hypothyroidism-related ($1672 vs. $1709; p<.0001) total costs, although the costs of drugs were higher in the adherent group. Furthermore, adherent patients, compared to nonadherent patients, were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with comorbid Addison's disease, bipolar disorder, chronic kidney disease, depression, migraine, obesity, type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Compared to nonadherence, adherence to LT4 among patients with hypothyroidism was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause and hypothyroidism-related costs and resource utilization as well as significantly lower rates of many comorbid diagnoses.","[Hepp, Zsolt] AbbVie Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Analyt, N Chicago, IL USA; [Lage, Maureen J.] HealthMetr Outcomes Res, 27576 River Reach Rd, Bonita Springs, FL 34134 USA; [Espaillat, Ramon] AbbVie Inc, US Med Affairs Endocrinol & Metab, N Chicago, IL USA; [Gossain, Ved V.] Michigan State Univ, Div Endocrinol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",AbbVie; AbbVie; Michigan State University,"Lage, MJ (通讯作者)，HealthMetr Outcomes Res, 27576 River Reach Rd, Bonita Springs, FL 34134 USA.",lagemj@hlthmetrics.com,,,AbbVie Inc.,AbbVie Inc.(AbbVie),"Financial support for this study was provided by AbbVie Inc.

This study developed and pilot tested a pain self-management intervention for chronic pain tailored to PLWH called Skills TO Manage Pain (STOMP). Objectives: Given the additional resources needed to deliver STOMP in HIV clinical settings, an important objective of the pilot study was to assess not only STOMP's preliminary efficacy, but also its cost-effectiveness. Research design and subjects: The present study draws from a 44-participant, 2-arm randomized pilot trial of the STOMP intervention vs usual care among PLWH and at least moderate chronic pain. Cost-effectiveness is presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs were considered from the clinic perspective over a 1-year time horizon using real costs from the pilot trial. It was conservatively assumed there would be no costs savings. The Standard Gamble (SG) method was used to directly measure utilities. Results: Thirty-six participants met inclusion criteria for the present analyses. Mean age was 52 years; 61% were female and 86% were black. The total cost of STOMP was $483.83 per person. Using the SG method, the change in QALYs was 0.15, corresponding to an ICER of $3,225. Conclusions: STOMP's cost/QALY is substantially lower than the $50,000 to $100,000/QALY benchmark often used to indicate cost-effectiveness. Although based on a pilot trial and, therefore, preliminary, these findings are promising, and suggest the importance of cost analyses in future STOMP trials.","[Merlin, Jessica S.; Westfall, Andrew O.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Div Infect Dis, Birmingham, AL USA; [Merlin, Jessica S.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Div Gerontol Geriatr & Palliat Care, Birmingham, AL USA; [Westfall, Andrew O.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Birmingham, AL USA; [Johnson, Mallory O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kerns, Robert D.] VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, PRIME Ctr, West Haven, CT USA; [Kerns, Robert D.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT USA; [Kerns, Robert D.] Yale Univ, Dept Neurol, New Haven, CT USA; [Kerns, Robert D.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA; [Bair, Matthew J.] Veterans Affairs Hlth Serv Res & Dev Ctr Hlth Inf, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Bair, Matthew J.] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Bair, Matthew J.] Regenstrief Inst Hlth Care, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Kertesz, Stefan] Birmingham VA Med Ctr, Birmingham, AL USA; [Kertesz, Stefan] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Med, Div Prevent Med, Birmingham, AL USA; [Turan, Janet M.; Kilgore, Meredith] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Care Org & Policy, Birmingham, AL USA; [Clay, Olivio J.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Birmingham, AL USA; [Starrels, Joanna L.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Bronx, NY USA; [Starrels, Joanna L.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Bronx, NY 10467 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Connecticut Healthcare System; Yale University; Yale University; Yale University; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Regenstrief Institute Inc; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Montefiore Medical Center; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine,"Merlin, JS (通讯作者)，BBRB 220a,1530 3rd Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",merlinjs@pitt.edu,,"Starrels, Joanna/0000-0002-1865-1966; Turan, Janet/0000-0002-7802-6206; Clay, Olivio/0000-0002-7529-6120","National Institutes of Health [K23MH104073, K24DA037034, R01DA039046]; University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research, an NIH funded program [P30 A1027767]; NIAID; NCI; NICHD; NHLBI; NIDA; NIMH; NIA; FIC; OAR; PRIME VA Health Services Research Center [CIN 13-047]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research, an NIH funded program; NIAID(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NCI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NHLBI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); NIDA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); FIC; OAR; PRIME VA Health Services Research Center","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (K23MH104073[JSM], K24DA037034[MOJ], R01DA039046[JLS]) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research, an NIH funded program (P30 A1027767) that was made possible by the following institutes-NIAID, NCI, NICHD, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, NIA, FIC, and OAR-and the PRIME VA Health Services Research Center (CIN 13-047).",,26,1,1,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The problem is to re-schedule flights and re-assign aircraft in real time with minimized recovery cost for airlines after disruptions occur. In most published studies, airport capacity and flexible maintenance are not considered simultaneously via an optimization approach. To bridge this gap, we propose a column generation heuristic to solve the problem. The framework consists of a master problem for selecting routes for aircraft and subproblems for generating routes. Airport capacity is explicitly considered in the master problem and swappable planned maintenances can be incorporated in the subproblem. Instead of discrete delay models which are widely adopted in much of the existing literature, in this work flight delays are continuous and optimized accurately in the subproblems. The continuous-delay model can improve the accuracy of the optimized recovery cost by up to 37.74%. The computational study based on real-world problems shows that the master problem gives very tight linear relaxation with small, often zero, optimality gaps. Large-scale problems can be solved within 6 min and the run time can be further shortened by parallelizing subproblems on more powerful hardware. In addition, from a managerial point of view, computational experiments reveal that swapping planned maintenances may bring a considerable reduction in recovery cost by about 20% and 60%, depending on specific problem instances. Furthermore, the decreasing marginal value of airport slot quota is found by computational experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In doing so, we identify relevant literature to address the following questions: (1) What definitive guidance can clinical evidence offer eye physicians and their patients? (2) What aspects of omega-3 supplementation lack definitive evidence, and how might economic assessments help? Methods: A targeted and systematic search strategy based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) was designed in this study for refereed clinical trials of omega-3s in dry eye treatment. Four key databases were accessed. Records were filtered through a three-step process using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was extracted for experimental design, sample population characteristics, content of test and control groups, symptoms and associated opthalmologic conditions, diagnostic measures, patient health outcomes, adverse events, and model time horizon. Results: A total of 219 records were initially identified, of which 21 prospective clinical trials, with a total of 2,973 participants, were admitted for review. Clinical evidence indicates that daily oral supplementation with omega-3s statistically correlates with dry eye treatment in the general symptomatic population as well as induced sub-populations. Reported adverse events are minimal. These trials nonetheless exhibit considerable heterogeneity in clinical endpoints, particularly as a result of the multi-factorial character of dry eye as well as continuous advances in scientific knowledge and technology. Their findings and recommendations appear to be of limited external validity. And causal inferences are needed, but difficult to establish. These have encouraged and sustained wide variations in ophthalmologic practice and normative decision-making. Conclusions: Comparability of omega-3 therapeutic efficacy and effectiveness remains a major challenge in dry eye disease management. Notwithstanding its multi-factorial character, addressing prevailing methodological and empirical issues in clinical trials will help reduce knowledge gaps and normative choices among eye physicians and patients alike. In this regard, pharmacoeconomics offers a useful and robust toolset through which analysis of cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility as well as meta-analysis can be comparatively pursued. Blending measures of costs and outcomes puts in perspective the heterogeneity of clinical endpoints in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.","[Mendoza, Roger Lee] Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA",Wilmington University,"Mendoza, RL (通讯作者)，Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, 31 Reads Way, New Castle, DE 19720 USA.",roger.l.mendoza@wilmu.edu,"Mendoza, Roger Lee/AAX-2110-2020",,,,,,51,5,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper we take an analytics approach to the possible use of pricing data of revenue-managed goods to support market analysis. Quantifying the relationship between market-level price volatility in the airline industry and various market-level performance metrics, we find that higher levels of price volatility are associated with higher levels of transacted fares, lower load factors, higher revenues, and increased transacted fare dispersion. This suggests the potential in utilizing market price volatility as an input for market analytics.","[Mantin, Benny] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Logist & Supply Chain Management, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Rubin, Eran] Univ Akron, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Akron, OH 44325 USA",University of Luxembourg; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Mantin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Logist & Supply Chain Management, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",benny.mantin@uni.lu; erubin@uakron.edu,,"Mantin, Benny/0000-0002-5206-7851",,,,,71,3,3,1,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Choosing therapies that are both effective and cost-effective is becoming increasingly important. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin, vs insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, in the US setting. Materials and methods: Long-term projections of cost-effectiveness outcomes were made using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical inputs were based on the DUAL VII trial, with costs (accounted from a healthcare payer perspective) and utilities based on published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Results: IDegLira was associated with increased discounted life expectancy by 0.02 years and increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.22 quality-adjusted life years compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Evaluation of direct medical costs suggested that the mean cost per patient with IDegLira was $3,571 lower than with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. The cost saving was driven predominantly by the lower acquisition cost of IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart, with further cost savings identified as a result of avoided treatment of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was associated with improved clinical outcomes at a reduced cost compared with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart. Conclusions: Based on clinical trial data, the present analysis suggests that IDegLira is associated with improved clinical outcomes and cost savings compared with treatment with insulin glargine U100 plus insulin aspart for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US. Therefore, IDegLira is likely to be considered dominant (cost saving and more effective) and, consequently, highly cost-effective in the US setting.","[Dempsey, Michael] Endocrine & Metab Consultants, Rockville, MD USA; [Mocarski, Michelle] Novo Nordisk Inc, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Langer, Jakob] Novo Nordisk Pharma Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Hunt, Barnaby] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland",Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Hunt, B (通讯作者)，Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",hunt@ossianconsulting.com,"Dempsey, Michael/GSM-7774-2022",,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk),The present cost-effectiveness analysis was supported by funding from Novo Nordisk A/S.,,43,6,6,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Several structural results for special cases of the problem are derived and studied. A solution method based on the outer approximation of the nonlinear terms is developed to solve the problem. The efficiency of the proposed model and solution approach is investigated through extensive numerical studies. Ignoring correlations can increase the total costs of a production-location-inventory system. Accounting for correlations may lead to changes in supply chain configuration. The effect of capacity on computational times was more pronounced in lower correlations than higher correlations. In addition, we show that the efficiency of the solution method increases significantly for two special cases - when all products have the same holding cost and when the number of orders for different products at each warehouse is constrained to be the same.

Crisaborole ointment is a non-steroidal, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD. In December 2016, crisaborole was approved in the US for mild-to-moderate AD in patients >= 2 years of age. Aims: To evaluate real-world utilization and cost of TCS and TCI in the US and estimate the budget impact of crisaborole over 2 years from a third-party payer perspective. Methods: TCS and TCI prescriptions in 2015 for patients >= 2 years of age with >= 1 AD diagnosis in the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Research Databases were analyzed for patients receiving TO or TCS alone or in combination (TCS/TCI population) and patients receiving TCI alone or in combination with TCS (TCI population). A budget impact model used TCS and TCI market shares, annual use, and cost per prescription. Crisaborole uptake rates of 4.7% (TCS) and 20.2% (TCI), with an annual increase of 1% in year 2, were assumed. Budget impact was calculated as total and per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost over 2 years for a health plan of 1 million members. Results: Annual prescriptions/patient ranged from 1.36-6.41; annual cost/patient was $53-$1,465. The budget impact of crisaborole over 2 years in the TCS/TCI population was $350,946 (PMPM, $0.015), with increases of $162,106 in year 1 (PMPM, $0.014) and $188,841 in year 2 (PMPM, $0.016). The budget impact in the TCI population was -$22,871, with decreases of $11,160 in year 1 and $11,712 in year 2 (each PMPM, -$0.001). For both populations, one-way sensitivity analyses showed that budget impact was most sensitive to changes in crisaborole cost and annual use. Conclusions: From US payer perspectives, adoption of crisaborole results in modest pharmacy budget impact/savings.","[Clark, Ryan; Bozkaya, Duygu] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Levenberg, Mark] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA USA; [Faulkner, Steven; Smith, Timothy W.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Gerber, Robert A.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer","Clark, R (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 402, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",ryan.clark@xcenda.com,,,Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),"This study was funded by Pfizer Inc., which manufactures crisaborole ointment, 2%.",,29,6,7,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The problem of estimating travel demand based on sensor data often results in an ill-posed inverse problem, where solution uniqueness cannot be ensured. To overcome this challenge, effective utilization of more information/data, preferably from reliable sources, becomes critical. Conventional demand estimation methods often sacrifice system structural information during the process of compressing sensor data into its statistics. Loss of structural information, which captures critical relation between observed and estimated parameters, inevitably causes more dependence on unrealistic assumptions and unreliable data. Our model is designed to preserve all structural information contained from different observation sets and allow it to directly contribute to the identification of population parameters of travel demand. The proposed hierarchical framework integrates two traditionally distinctive identification problems, mean demand estimation and trip table reconstruction. Through mathematical analyses and numerical experiments, we show that the proposed framework improves parameter identifiability and leads to better estimation quality compared to conventional methods. The proposed framework is also flexible to accommodate a wide variety of travel behavior assumptions and estimation principles. As an example among many possible alternatives, Wardrop equilibrium based traffic assignment and generalized least square are implemented and tested using a case study based on a moderately large network.

As real-world studies examining the interchangeability of tacrolimus from different manufacturers are limited, the purpose of this study was to examine the healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and economic impact of tacrolimus-switching in kidney transplantation. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study examined HRU and healthcare costs (HCCs) among patients with a kidney transplant who were prescribed tacrolimus from fixed-source (FS) vs variable-source (VS) manufacturers using claims data from the large US health plan Humana from October 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. Results: Overall, 1,024 patients were identified (FS: n = 674, 66%; VS: n = 350, 34%). The number of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) events for the VS group was 13% greater than for the FS group after controlling for demographics, comorbidity score, and number of medications (incidence rate ratio = 1.13, p = .033). Adjusted total HCCs were 9% lower for VS (US$28,054 vs US$30,823, p = .045). In the unadjusted analysis, VS had greater emergency department (ED) utilization (45% vs 35%, p < .002). In the VS group, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) number of days from manufacturer switch to first outpatient visit was 23.8 (33.6), and the number of days (SD) to first TDM event was 43.6 (56.2). Limitations: Study limitations include the lack of availability of many transplant-specific variables within the Humana database, potential errors/omissions in claims coding, and restriction of cross-sectional data examination to a 1-year period. Conclusions: VS patients had greater TDM and lower total HCCs. Further research is warranted to understand the drivers of ED use among the VS group, and to determine factors associated with delayed TDM after regimen modification. Opportunities may exist to improve the quality of care for patients receiving immunosuppressant treatment with tacrolimus.","[Bunniran, Suvapun; Kamble, Pravin; Suehs, Brandon] Humana Inc, Comprehens Hlth Insights, Louisville, KY USA; [Lee, Edward; Schwartz, Jason; Thal, Gary; Spalding, James] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Med Affairs, Northbrook, IL USA; [Franks, Billy] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Real World Informat, Leiden, Netherlands",Humana Inc.; Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Bunniran, S (通讯作者)，Comprehens Hlth Insights, Humana Bldg,515 West Market St, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",sbunniran@humana.com,,,"Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","This study was funded by Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",,25,0,0,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This analysis estimated HRU and costs among newly diagnosed AML patients in a US commercially insured population. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective observational study using the IMS Health PharMetrics Plus and Hospital Charge Detail Master databases. Patients included adults who were newly diagnosed with AML between January 2007 and June 2016 (study period). Patients with <12 months of continuous enrollment prior to the index date were excluded, as were those whose first diagnosis was AML in remission/relapse, those diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia, those on Medicare supplemental insurance, or those with a diagnosis of AML in remission/relapse without evidence of treatment during the study period. Patients were stratified by receipt of AML treatment (chemotherapy/hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]), and their follow-up was partitioned into initial, remission, and relapsed health states. Mean HRU and costs were tallied by treatment and, for treated patients, by health state and time since entry into health state (<= 6 vs >6 months). Results: A total of 9,455 patients met study criteria, including 6,415 (68%) treated and 3,040 (32%) untreated patients, with mean follow-up of 18.3 and 16.4 months, respectively. Mean age was 55 years in treated patients and 60 years in untreated patients. Mean total costs per patient were $386,077 in treated patients and $79,382 in untreated patients. For treated patients, 60% of total costs ($231,867 per patient) were incurred during the initial health state, representing time without remission/relapse. Mean monthly total healthcare costs were $21,055 and $4,854 among treated and untreated patients, respectively. Limitations and conclusions: HRU and costs of managing AML patients are substantial. In treated patients, the majority of costs were incurred during the initial treatment period, without claims indicating remission/relapse.","[Hagiwara, May; Sharma, Arati; Delea, Thomas E.] PAI, 4 Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA; [Chung, Karen C.] Jazz Pharmaceut Inc, Palo Alto, CA USA",Policy Analysis Inc; Jazz Pharmaceuticals,"Hagiwara, M (通讯作者)，PAI, 4 Davis Court, Brookline, MA 02445 USA.",mhagiwara@pai2.com,,"Sharma, Arati/0000-0002-2831-2941","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This study was sponsored by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,14,29,28,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Based on the proposed network, we provide formulations and algorithms for both neoclassical and income-targeting hypotheses to characterize the labor supply of ride-sourcing drivers, i.e., their choices of work hours. We then investigate the impact of surge pricing using a bi-level programming framework, with the lower-level problem capturing the equilibrium work hour choices while the upper-level one representing revenue-maximizing surge pricing. Compared to static pricing, the platform and drivers are found to generally enjoy higher revenue while customers may be made worse off during highly surged periods.

We study a cost sharing problem in a freight consolidation system with one consolidation center and a common destination. In particular, we design a mechanism that collects bids from a set of suppliers, and then decides whose demand to ship via the consolidation center and the corresponding cost shares. We use the Moulin mechanism framework to design a truthful mechanism for the cost-sharing problem, and study the mechanism's budget-balance guarantee and economic efficiency. We find that it is generally not possible to obtain a simultaneously truthful and budget-balanced Moulin mechanism under the transportation cost structure we study. For our proposed mechanism, there exists a trade-off between the budget-balance guarantee and the level of incentives that can be given to large suppliers. Additionally, the mechanism has better economic efficiency when there are more bidding suppliers or the destination is farther away. In our setting, either the consolidation center or the suppliers need to be subsidized. The parameters that determine the trade-off between the consolidation center's benefit and suppliers' cost savings should be set based on the specific goals of the consolidation center. Encouraging more suppliers to bid helps to increase the overall social welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolution of the human drivers' route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.

This paper focuses on one type of network design problem as to whether existing roads should be retrofit into HOT lanes. It is a continuous bi-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. The lower level problem is ridesharing user equilibrium (RUE). To reduce the problem size and facilitate computation, we reformulate RUE in the link-node representation. Then we extend the RUE framework to accommodate the presence of HOT lanes and tolls.

Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all cases in the US, with annual costs estimated to be $246 billion per year. This study investigated the impact of a glucose-measuring intervention to the burden of type 2 diabetes. Objective: This analysis seeks to understand how professional continuous glucose monitoring (professional CGM) impacts clinical and economic outcomes when compared to patients who are not prescribed professional CGM. Methods: This study utilized a large healthcare claims and lab dataset from the US, and identified a cohort of patients who were prescribed professional CGM as identified by CPT codes 95250 and 95251. It calculated economic and clinical outcomes 1 year before and 1 year after the use of professional CGM, using a generalized linear model. Results: Patients who utilized professional CGM saw an improvement in hemoglobin A1C. The difference-in-difference calculation for A1C was shown to be -0.44%. There was no statistically significant difference in growth of total annual costs for people who used professional CGM compared to those who did not ($1,270, p=.08). Patients using professional CGM more than once per year had a -$3,376 difference in the growth of total costs (p=.05). Patients who used professional CGM while changing their diabetes treatment regimen also had a difference of -$3,327 in growth of total costs (p=.0023). Conclusion: Significant clinical benefits were observed for patients who used professional CGM. Economic benefits were observed for patients who utilized professional CGM more than once within a 1-year period or who used it during a change of diabetes therapy. This suggests that professional CGM may help decrease rising trends in healthcare costs for people with type 2 diabetes, while also improving clinical outcomes.","[Sierra, Joseph A.; Shah, Mona; Gill, Max S.; Flores, Zachery; Chawla, Hiten; Kaufman, Francine R.; Vigersky, Robert] Medtron Diabet Inc, Northridge, CA USA",,"Sierra, JA (通讯作者)，Medtron MiniMed Inc, 18000 Devonshire St, Northridge, CA 91325 USA.",joseph.a.sierra@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic Diabetes,Medtronic Diabetes,This study was sponsored by Medtronic Diabetes.,,13,21,23,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Following induction, 64% of commercially insured patients and 53% of Medicare beneficiaries had >= 1 consolidation cycle; 75% and 65% of consolidation cycles were in an inpatient setting, respectively. For consolidation cycles, in the inpatient setting, mean costs were $28,137 for commercially insured patients and $28,843 for Medicare beneficiaries, median cycle duration was 6 days (both); in the outpatient setting, mean costs were $11,271 for commercially insured patients and $5,803 Medicare beneficiaries, median duration was 5 days (both). Limitations: Granular information on chemotherapy type administered was unavailable. Conclusions: This is the first exploratory study providing a complete picture of recent AML treatment patterns and management costs among commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries. There is substantial heterogeneity in the management and costs of AML.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Latremouille-Viau, Dominick; Guerin, Annie; Shi, Sherry; Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Patrick] Anal Grp Inc, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Ste 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada",Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.,"Gagnon-Sanschagrin, P (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Ste 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",patrick.gagnon-sanschagrin@analysisgroup.com,"Joseph, George/JJE-9445-2023",,Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),Funding for this research was provided by Novartis.,,38,27,27,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy in the context of the United Kingdom (UK) healthcare system. Methods: A Markov cohort model consisting of four health states (Stable after index stroke, Post-Minor Recurrent Stroke, Post-Moderate Recurrent Stroke, and Death) was developed to simulate the economic outcomes of device-based PFO closure compared to medical therapy. Recurrent stroke event rates were extracted from a randomized clinical trial (RESPECT) with a median of 5.9-year follow-up. Health utilities and costs were obtained from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess robustness. The model was discounted at 3.5% and reported in 2016 Pounds Sterling. Results: Compared with medical therapy alone and using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20,000 pound, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness at 4.2 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 4, 10, and 20 years were 20,951 pound, 6,887 pound, and 2,158 pound, respectively. PFO closure was cost-effective for 89% of PSA iterations at year 10. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust. Conclusions: Considering the UK healthcare system perspective, percutaneous PFO closure in cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients is a cost-effective stroke prevention strategy compared to medical therapy alone. Its cost-effectiveness was driven by substantial reduction in recurrent strokes and patients' improved health-related quality-of-life.","[Tirschwell, David L.] Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Turner, Mark] Univ Hosp Bristol, Bristol Heart Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Thaler, David] Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Choulerton, James] Royal United Hosp, Bath, Avon, England; [Marks, David] Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Carroll, John] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [MacDonald, Lee] South Denver Cardiol Associates PC, Littleton, CO USA; [Smalling, Richard W.] UT Hlth McGovern Med Sch, Mem Hermann Heart & Vasc Inst, Houston, TX USA; [Koullick, Maria; Gu, Ning Yan] Abbott, Abbott Pk, IL USA; [Saver, Jeffrey L.] Reed Neurol Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA",Harborview Medical Center; University of Bristol; Tufts Medical Center; Medical College of Wisconsin; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Vascular,"Tirschwell, DL (通讯作者)，Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",tirsch@uw.edu,"Roquer, Jaume/D-9483-2011; Turner, Mark S/L-3798-2013","Tirschwell, David/0000-0002-8059-2901",Abbott,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories),This manuscript was funded by Abbott.,,37,12,12,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In the literature, the SBPP is usually decomposed into the routing and scheduling subproblems due to its complexity. Because of the nature of the decomposition, even if all the subproblems are solved to optimality, the final solution may not be as good as the solution from the integrated model. In this paper, we present a new approach that incorporates the scheduling information (namely the trip compatibility) into the routing stage such that the interrelationship between the subproblems is still considered even in the decomposed problems. A novel two-step heuristic adopting the trip compatibility idea is presented to solve the school bus routing problem under single load assumptions. The first step finds an initial solution using an iterative minimum cost matching-based insertion heuristic. Then, the initial trips are improved using a Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search hybrid method. Experiments were conducted on randomly generated problems and benchmark problems in the literature. The result shows that our two-step heuristic improves existing solutions of single-load problems by up to 25% on benchmark problems.

The DNL defines the so-called network delay operator, which maps a set of path departure rates to a set of path travel times (or costs). It is widely known that the delay operator is not available in closed form, and has undesirable properties that severely complicate DTA analysis and computation, such as discontinuity, non-differentiability, non-monotonicity, and computational inefficiency. This paper proposes a fresh take on this important and difficult issue, by providing a class of surrogate DNL models based on a statistical learning method known as Kriging. We present a metamodeling framework that systematically approximates DNL models and is flexible in the sense of allowing the modeler to make trade-offs among model granularity, complexity, and accuracy. It is shown that such surrogate DNL models yield highly accurate approximations (with errors below 8%) and superior computational efficiency (9 to 455 times faster than conventional DNL procedures such as those based on the link transmission model). Moreover, these approximate DNL models admit closed-form and analytical delay operators, which are Lipschitz continuous and infinitely differentiable, with closed form Jacobians. We provide in-depth discussions on the implications of these properties to DTA research and model applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In Cassidy (1998), a method was proposed to manually identify near-stationary states by visually inspecting transformed curves of cumulative total vehicle counts and occupancies. Such near-stationary states are important for calibrating fundamental diagrams, identifying active bottlenecks and incidents, and quantifying capacity drop magnitudes. To the best of our knowledge, however, there lacks an automatic method that can be applied to efficiently identify near-stationary states from a large amount of data. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap. We start with definitions of steady, stationary, and equilibrium states and discuss their relations. Then we present a novel four-step method for automatically identifying near-stationary states from raw loop-detector data: first, the raw data are pre-processed to obtain healthy datasets, fill in missing values, and normalize averaged vehicle counts and occupancies to the same scale; second, daily time series are partitioned into multiple candidate intervals based on the pruned exact linear time (PELT) changepoint detection method; third, the characteristics of the candidate intervals are calculated; and finally, near-stationary states are selected based on modified Cassidy's gap and duration criteria. We further close the loop by presenting an algorithm to automatically determine the penalty threshold in the second step and the gap threshold in fourth step to ensure the quantity as well as the quality of identified near-stationary states. In a case study, we apply the proposed method to identify near-stationary states from a large set of 30-s raw loop-detector data at a freeway mainline station. We verify the validity of identified near-stationary states both directly and indirectly. The results show that the identified near-stationary states are valid with high quality and the calibrated triangular fundamental diagram is well-fitted and physically meaningful. We finally conclude by discussing some future improvements and potential applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to evaluate the actual drug wastage and cost to the healthcare system using patient-level retrospective observational electronic medical record (EMR) data from a cohort of lung cancer patients in the US. Methods: Data from the Flatiron Health advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort was used for this study. Drug administered amount (in mg) was used to determine an optimal set of available vial sizes to minimize waste. Drug wastage was defined as the difference between the drug amount in the optimal set of vials and the administered amount. Wholesale acquisition costs were used to value the cost of drugs, with and without vial sharing assumptions. The amount and cost of waste were quantified over the 2-year study period (January 2015-December 2016). Results: There were 8,467 eligible patients included in this study, providing data from 103,826 unique drug administrations across multiple lines of therapy. Overall wastage was 437% of the total medication used to care for patients. While costs per administration were low, the total cost of wastage for the study population represented $16,630,112 across the 2-year study period. Assuming that vial sharing occurred at the site level slightly reduced waste to 3.74% (reducing costs to $15,953,212 over 2 years). Conclusions: Drug wastage is an important concern and has implications on healthcare costs in NSCLC. Evaluation of these real-world data suggest that pharmacists and physicians are able to reduce drug wastage by optimizing vial combinations and sharing vials among patients. Even small amounts of reduction in wastage could be useful in reducing healthcare costs in the US; however, caution is needed with drug rounding efforts to ensure patients do not receive a sub-optimal dose of medication.","[Hess, Lisa M.; Cui, Zhanglin Lin; Li, Xiaohong Ivy; Oton, Ana B.; Shortenhaus, Scott; Watson, Ian A.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",Eli Lilly,"Hess, LM (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",hess_lisa_m@lilly.com,,,,,,,13,12,12,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records of US community oncology practices was conducted. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV) diagnosed between January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2015, initiated treatment with erlotinib or afatinib (first-line or second-line), and had disease progression. Monthly Medicare-paid costs were evaluated during the TKI therapy period and following progression. Results: The study included 364 patients. The total mean monthly cost during TKI therapy was $20,106 (95% confidence interval [CI]=$16,836-$23,376), of which 47.0% and 42.4% represented hospitalization costs and anti-cancer therapy costs, respectively. Following progression on TKI therapy (data available for 316 patients), total mean monthly cost was $19,274 (95% CI=$15,329-$23,218), and was higher in the 76.3% of patients who received anti-cancer therapy following progression than in the 23.7% of those who did not ($20,490 vs $15,364; p<.001). Among patients who received it, anti-cancer therapy ($11,198; 95% CI=$7,102-$15,295) represented 54.7% of total mean monthly cost. Among patients who did not receive anti-cancer therapy, hospitalization ($13,829; 95% CI=$4,922-$22,736) represented 90.0% of total mean monthly cost. Impaired performance status and brain metastases were significant predictors of increased cost during TKI therapy. Limitations: The study design may limit the generalizability of findings. Conclusions: Healthcare costs during TKI treatment and following progression appeared to be similar and were largely attributed to hospitalization and anti-cancer therapy. Notably, almost one-quarter of patients did not receive anti-cancer therapy following progression, potentially indicating an unmet need; hospitalization was the largest cost contributor for these patients. Additional effective targeted therapies are needed that could prolong progression-free survival, leading to fewer hospitalizations for EGFR mutation-positive patients.","[Skinner, Karen E.; Walker, Mark S.] Vector Oncol, 6555 Quince,Suite 400, Memphis, TN 38119 USA; [Fernandes, Ancilla W.; Pavilack, Melissa] AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [VanderWalde, Ari] West Canc Ctr, Memphis, TN USA",AstraZeneca,"Skinner, KE (通讯作者)，Vector Oncol, 6555 Quince,Suite 400, Memphis, TN 38119 USA.",kskinner@vectoroncology.com,"VanderWalde, Ari/HLQ-7510-2023",,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),The study was funded by AstraZeneca.,,30,28,29,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

SP data is often treated with suspicion because consumers may respond differently in a hypothetical survey context than they do in the marketplace. However, models built on RP data can suffer from endogeneity bias when attributes that drive consumer choices are unobserved by the modeler and correlated with observed variables. Using a synthetic data experiment, we test the performance of pooled RP-SP models in recovering the preference parameters that generated the market data under conditions that choice modelers are likely to face, including (1) when there is potential for endogeneity problems in the RP' data, such as omitted variable bias, and (2) when consumer willingness to pay for attributes may differ from the survey context to the market context. We identify situations where pooling RP and SP data does and does not mitigate each data source's respective weaknesses. We also show that the likelihood ratio test, which has been widely used to determine whether pooling is statistically justifiable, (1) can fail to identify the case where SP context preference differences and RP endogeneity bias shift the parameter estimates of both models in the same direction and magnitude and (2) is unreliable when the product attributes are fixed within a small number of choice sets, which is typical of automotive RP data. Our findings offer new insights into when pooling data sources may or may not be advisable for accurately estimating market preference parameters, including consideration of the conditions and context under which the data were generated as well as the relative balance of information between data sources.

The TYRX Antibacterial Envelope is a polypropylene mesh that stabilizes the CIED and elutes minocycline and rifampin to reduce the risk of post-operative infection. Methods: A decision tree was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TYRX vs standard of care (SOC) following implantation of four CIED device types. The model was parameterized for a UK National Health Service perspective. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration, hospitalization, adverse events, device extraction, and replacement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Over a 12-month time horizon, TYRX was less costly and more effective than SOC when utilized in patients with an ICD or CRT-D. TYRX was associated with ICERs of 46,548 and 21,768 pound per QALY gained in patients with an IPG or CRT-P, respectively. TYRX was cost-effective at a 30,000 pound threshold at baseline probabilities of infection exceeding 1.65% (CRT-D), 1.95% (CRT-P), 1.87% (IPG), and 1.38% (ICD). Limitations and conclusions: Device-specific infection rates for high-risk patients were not available in the literature and not used in this analysis, potentially under-estimating the impact of TYRX in certain devices. Nevertheless, TYRX is associated with a reduction in post-operative infection risk relative to SOC, resulting in reduced healthcare resource utilization at an initial cost. The ICERs are below the accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds used by UK decision-makers. TYRX, therefore, represents a cost-effective prevention option for CIED patients at high-risk of post-operative infection.","[Kay, Gemma; Kumar, Gayathri; Fenwick, Elisabeth] ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Eby, Elizabeth L.] Medtron Plc, Mounds View, MN USA; [Brown, Benedict; Eggington, Simon] Medtron Int Trading Sarl, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Lyon, Julie] Medtron Ltd, Watford, England; [Sohail, M.

Lower resource use in the F group was characterized by shorter hospital length of stay and surgical time as well as fewer blood transfusions and less hemostat agent used per surgery. Objective: To evaluate the cost-consequence of using F compared to F + G/T in minor, major and severe spinal surgery from the US hospital perspective. Methods: A cost-consequence model was developed using the US hospital perspective. Model inputs include clinical inputs from the literature, cost inputs (hemostatic matrices, blood product transfusion, hospital stay and operating room time) from the literature, and an analysis of annual spine surgery volume (minor, major and severe) using the 2012 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Costs are reported in 2017 US dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses address sources of variability in the results. Results: A medium-volume hospital (130 spine surgeries per year) using F versus F +G/T for spine surgeries is expected to require 85 less hours of surgical time, 58 fewer hospital days and 7 fewer blood transfusions in addition to hemostat volume savings (F: 1 mL, thrombin: 1994 mL). The cost savings associated with the hospital resources for a medium-volume hospital are expected to be $317,959 (surgical hours = $154,746, hospital days = $125,237, blood transfusions = $19,023, hemostatic agents = $18,953) or $2445 per spine surgery. Conclusions: The use of F versus F +G/T could lead to annual cost savings for US hospitals performing a low to high volume of spinal surgeries per year.","[Ramirez, Manuel G.; Yang, Dongyan] Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Niu, Xiaoli; Epstein, Josh] Stratevi, Santa Monica, CA USA",Baxter International Inc,"Ramirez, MG (通讯作者)，Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA.",manuel_ramirez@baxter.com,"Yang, Dongyan/S-4258-2016",,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,The study was funded by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,21,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study was aimed at comparing administration times and associated costs of infliximab and vedolizumab infusions for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Materials and methods: This study used claims data from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse to identify IBD patients using infliximab or vedolizumab between 20 May 2014 and 29 February 2016. Use of Current Procedural Terminology administration codes was evaluated and costs calculated using the 2016 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Fee Schedule. Assessments included infusion times, associated costs, productivity loss using average wage estimates from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, and home infusion adoption. Results: A total of 10,051 infliximab and 3114 vedolizumab patients with first-hour claims were identified; 52.0% were female and 64.5% had Crohn's disease. There were 48,377 infliximab first-hour claims (mean 4.8 infusions per patient); 46,462 (96.0%) had a second-hour claim. In comparison, there were 14,717 vedolizumab claims (mean 4.7 infusions per patient), with only 411 (2.8%) second-hour claims, resulting in vedolizumab cost savings of approximately $1.27 million. The difference in second-hour infusions resulted in 46,051 additional hours of productivity loss with infliximab, and lost wages averaging $1.18 million (range $0.68-$1.77 million). Limitations: Administration costs were inferred as charge costs and not directly assessed. Productivity loss assessed time spent on infusion only, and included a small proportion of patients beyond working age. Conclusions: Second-hour infusion billing was significantly lower with vedolizumab than with infliximab, corresponding to cost savings and reduced productivity loss.","[Null, Kyle; Kumar, Varun; Lissoos, Trevor; Luo, Michelle] Takeda Pharmaceut USA Inc, One Takeda Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Kumar, Varun] Inst Clin & Econ Review, Boston, MA USA",Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

In the first, we consider problems wherein the transportation service provider can choose the transportation requests it serves in order to maximize profit. In the second, we consider problems wherein they can take advantage of periods of light traffic by dictating to drivers when their routes should begin. We also consider problems wherein these flexibilities are not present. We propose an exact solution approach for solving problems from this family that is based upon branch and price, wherein columns are generated via a tailored labeling algorithm. We augment the framework with adaptations of various speed-up techniques from the literature, including limited-memory subset-row cuts and route enumeration. With an extensive computational study, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the impact of the adapted techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: Truven's Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2014 was queried for US adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism who initiated Synthroid and adhered to such therapy for at least 6 months. Propensity score matching matched continuous users of Synthroid to patients who switched from Synthroid to alternative levothyroxine agents. Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed differences between the matched cohorts in several categories of costs, including disease-related drug costs, non-drug medical costs, and total direct medical costs. Results: There were 10,159 individuals included in the study, with 7,991 continuous users of Synthroid and 2,168 switchers. After matching (n = 2,052 for each cohort), continuous use of Synthroid was associated with significantly lower hypothyroidism-related non-drug medical costs ($595 vs $1,023; p = .003) and reduced hypothyroidism-related total medical costs ($757 vs $1,132; p = .010), despite being associated with significantly higher drug costs ($161 vs $109; p < .001). Hypothyroidism-related total medical costs rose as the number of switches of hypothyroidism treatment increased, with continuous users having significantly lower hypothyroidism-related total medical costs ($757) compared with patients who switched twice ($1,179; p = .001) or three or more times ($1,268; p = .004). Limitations: The analyses focused on continuously insured patients who were adherent to Synthroid for at least 6 months and results may not be generalizable. The reliance on claims data does not allow for clinical examination of hypothyroidism or inclusion of some factors that may be associated with outcomes. The analyses assume that all prescriptions filled are taken as prescribed. Conclusions: Results indicate that there are significant direct economic healthcare costs associated with switching from Synthroid to alternative levothyroxine therapies, and that these costs increase as patients switch therapies more frequently.","[Khandelwal, Nikhil; Johns, Beverly; Hepp, Zsolt; Castelli-Haley, Jane] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",AbbVie,"Hepp, Z (通讯作者)，AbbVie Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Analyt, 1 N Waukegan Rd, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",zsolt.hepp@abbvie.com,,,"AbbVie, Inc.; AbbVie","AbbVie, Inc.(AbbVie); AbbVie(AbbVie)","Support for this study was provided by AbbVie, Inc.

Extending Newell's car following model to describe the transition from free-flow to congested regimes, two elements of breakdown, trigger and propagation, are derived in terms of vehicle headway. Combining these elements, a general breakdown probability is derived in terms of various parameters related to driver behavior and traffic conditions - other than flow - that can be treated as constants or stochastic with probability distributions. The proposed model is validated with real data. It was found that the theoretical breakdown probability distribution accords well with the empirical counterpart within reasonable ranges of parameter values. Our model suggests that the breakdown probability (i) increases with flow (both mainline and merging) as expected, and the merging spacing, (ii) decreases with the merging speed and aggressive driver characteristics, and interestingly, (iii) increases with the deviation in headway. A proactive traffic control method to achieve uniform headway is developed considering low penetration rates of connected automated vehicle technologies.

The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases recommends revaccination for older adults who received primary vaccination >= 5 years earlier. The cost-effectiveness of adding revaccination and/or continuing catch-up vaccination in the NIP was evaluated from the public payer perspective in Japan. Methods: The Markov model included five health states: no pneumococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae, and death. Cohorts of adults aged 65-95 were followed until age 100 or death: 2014 cohort (aged 65-95, vaccinated: 2014); 2019 cohort (aged 65: 2019); and 2019 catch-up cohort (aged 70-100: 2019, unvaccinated: 2014). Strategies included: (1) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts; (2) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts and revaccinate both; (3) strategy 1 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; (4) strategy 2 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; and (5) strategy 4 and revaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort. Parameters were retrieved from global and Japanese sources, costs and QALYs discounted at 2%, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated. Results: Strategy 1 had the highest number of IPD and NBPP cases, and strategy 5 the lowest. Strategies 3-5 dominated strategy 1 and strategy 2 was cost-effective compared to strategy 1 (ICER: (sic)1,622,153 per QALY gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of V5 million per QALY gained, strategy 2 was cost-effective and strategies 3-5 were cost-saving compared to strategy 1. Conclusions: Strategies including revaccination, catch-up, or both were cost-effective or cost-saving in comparison to no revaccination and no catch-up.

A hybrid approach is used to study the problem: analytical approach to capture the behavior of merging and diverging LCs and numerical simulations to quantify capacity-drop considering various geometric configurations of extended bottlenecks. This study focuses on the impact of LC vehicles' bounded acceleration on void (wasted space) creation in traffic streams when they insert/desert at a lower speed, and interactions among multiple voids. We found that (1) LCs closer to the downstream end of bottlenecks are more likely to create persisting voids and contribute to capacity-drop. (2) For weave bottlenecks, capacity-drop is governed by two counteracting effects of LCs: persisting voids and utilization of vacancies created by diverging vehicles: (3) the more balanced the merging and diverging flows, the lower the capacity-drop; and (4) capacity-drop is minimum if merging LCs occur downstream of diverging LCs, and maximum in the opposite alignment.

(3) To identify patient, physician, and hospital predictors of conversion. Materials and methods: A US-based database study was conducted utilizing the 2012-2014 Premier Healthcare Data, including rectal cancer patients 18 with rectal resection. ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedural codes were utilized to identify surgical approaches, conversions to OS, and surgical complications. Propensity score matching on patient, surgeon, and hospital level characteristics was used to create comparable groups of RA\LS patients (n = 533 per group). Predictors of conversion from LS and RA to OS were identified with stepwise logistic regression in the unmatched sample. Results: Post-match results suggested comparable perioperative complication rates (RA 29% vs LS 29%; p = .7784); whereas conversion rates to OS were 12% for RA vs 29% for LS (p<.0001). Colorectal surgeons (RA 9% vs LS 23%), general surgeons (RA 13% vs LS 35%), and smaller bed-size hospitals (RA 14% vs LS 33%) have reduced conversion rates for RA vs LS (p<.0001). Statistically significant predictors of conversion included LS, non-colorectal surgeon, and smaller bed-size hospitals. Limitations: Retrospective observational study limitations apply. Analysis of the hospital administrative database was subject to the data captured in the database and the accuracy of coding. Propensity score matching limitations apply. RA and LS groups were balanced with respect to measured patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics. Conclusions: Compared to LS, RA offers a higher probability of completing a successful minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer patients undergoing rectal resection without exacerbating complications. Male, obese, or moderately-to-severely ill patients had higher conversion rates. While colorectal surgeons had lower conversion rates from RA than LS, the reduction was magnified for general surgeons and smaller bed-size hospitals.","[Ackerman, Stacey J.] Covance Market Access Serv Inc, 10300 Campus Point Dr,Suite 225, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Daniel, Shoshana; Baik, Rebecca] Covance Market Access Serv, Gaithersburg, MD USA; [Liu, Emelline; Tackett, Scott] Intuit Surg, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Mehendale, Shilpa] Intuit Surg, Clin Affairs, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Hellan, Minia] Wright State Univ, Surg Oncol, Centerville, OH USA","Covance; Covance; Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton","Ackerman, SJ (通讯作者)，Covance Market Access Serv Inc, 10300 Campus Point Dr,Suite 225, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",stacey.ackerman@covance.com,,,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA)","Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA)","This study was sponsored by Intuitive Surgical, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA).",,37,24,25,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Adult patients (18-64 years of age) enrolled in the Marketscan Commercial and Medicare Databases with >= 2 non-diagnostic outpatient (>= 30 days apart between the two outpatient claims) or >= 1 inpatient diagnoses of cluster headache (ICD-9-CM code 339.00, 339.01, or 339.02) between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2014, were included in the analyses. Patients had >= 6 months of continuous enrollment with medical and pharmacy coverage before and after the index date (first cluster headache diagnosis). Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) healthcare resource utilization, (2) direct healthcare costs, and (3) indirect costs associated with work days lost due to absenteeism and short-term disability. Direct costs included costs of all-cause and cluster headache-related outpatient, inpatient hospitalization, surgery, and pharmacy claims. Indirect costs were based on an average daily wage, which was estimated from the 2014 US Bureau of Labor Statistics and inflated to 2015 dollars. Results: There were 9,328 patients with cluster headache claims included in the analysis. Cluster headache-related total direct costs (mean [standard deviation]) were $3,132 [$13,396] per patient per year (PPPY), accounting for 17.8% of the all-cause total direct cost. Cluster headache-related inpatient hospitalizations ($1,604) and pharmacy ($809) together ($2,413) contributed over 75% of the cluster headache- related direct healthcare cost. There were three sub-groups of patients with claims associated with indirect costs that included absenteeism, short-term disability, and absenteeism + short-term disability. Indirect costs PPPY were $4,928 [$4,860] for absenteeism, $803 [$2,621] for short-term disability, and $ 3,374 [$ 3,198] for absenteeism + disability. Conclusion: Patients with cluster headache have high healthcare costs that are associated with inpatient admissions and pharmacy fulfillments, and high indirect costs associated with absenteeism and short-term disability.","[Ford, Janet H.; Ahl, Jonna; Martinez, James M.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Nero, Damion; Kim, Gilwan; Chu, Bong Chul; Fowler, Robert] Truven Hlth Analyt, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Eli Lilly,"Ford, JH (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Real World Evidence Biomed, Lilly Corp Ctr, Drop Code 1730, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",ford_janet@lilly.com,,,"Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN","Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN(Eli Lilly)","The study sponsor (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) funded the study and was involved in the study design, data interpretation, and writing of the article.

Materials and methods: Patients with a diagnosis of selected autoimmune and inflammatory diseases between 1 January 2006 and 30 September 2015 (study period) were selected from a de-identified, privately-insured claims database. Patients were stratified into four treatment cohorts based on the dosing and duration of continuous corticosteroid use following disease diagnosis: intermittent use with < 60 days of corticosteroid use and >= 60 days of corticosteroid use with low (<= 7.5 mg/day), medium (>7.5-<= 15mg/day), or high (>15mg/day) dosage. Patients were followed from the date of their highest dose episode of corticosteroid use (treatment index date) until the earliest of the end of continuous corticosteroid use +30 days, disenrollment from health plan, or the end of the study period (follow-up period). HCRU and costs in the follow-up period were compared across treatment cohorts. Results: Of 78,704 patients who were identified for study inclusion, 29% had extended corticosteroid use lasting >= 60 days, and 71% had intermittent use. On average, patients in the high-dose cohort incurred twice the cost of intermittent users ($68,408 vs $32,690 in annualized total all-cause healthcare costs, USD). Adverse event-related medical costs accounted for similar to 40% of medical costs, and were higher than disease-related medical costs for all cohorts with extended corticosteroid exposure. Comparing the high-dose and low-dose cohorts, the smaller savings in disease-related prescriptions ($1,680) occurred along with a much larger cost in adverse event-related spend ($13,464). Limitations: The impact of corticosteroids may be under-estimated because of conservative follow-up duration, and administrative data may contain inaccuracies in coding. Conclusions: Steroid use, especially at higher doses, is associated with higher HCRU and costs.","[Rice, J.

Nanjing-one of the first provincial capital cities to implement the reformis studied to evaluate the effects of the comprehensive reform on drug prices in public hospitals, and to explore differential compensation plans.Methods: Sixteen hospitals were selected, and financial data were collected over the 48-month period before the reform and for 12 months after the reform. An analysis was carried out using a simple linear interrupted time series model.Results: The average difference ratio of drug surplus fell 13.39% after the reform, and the drug markups were basically eliminated. Revenue from medical services showed a net growth of 28.25%. The overall compensation received from government financial budget and medical service revenue growth was 103.69% for the loss from policy-permitted 15% markup sales, and 116.48% for the net loss. However, there were large differences in compensation levels at different hospitals, ranging from -21.92% to 413.74% by medical services revenue growth, causing the combined rate of both financial and service compensation to vary from 28.87-413.74%, There was a significant positive correlation between the services compensation rate and the proportion of medical service revenue (p<.001), and the compensation rate increased by 8% for every 1% increase in the proportion of services revenue.Discussion: Nanjing's pricing and compensation reform has basically achieved the policy targets of eliminating the drug markups, promoting the growth of medical services revenue, and adjusting the structure of medical revenue. However, the growth rate of service revenue of hospitals varied significantly from one another.Conclusions: Nanjing's reform represents successful pricing and compensation reform in Chinese urban public hospitals. It is recommended that a differentiated and dynamic compensation plan should be established in accordance with the revenue structure of different hospitals.","[Tang, Wenxi; Xie, Jing; Lu, Yijuan; Ma, Aixia] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qizhi] Nanjing Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Publ Hosp Management Comm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Malone, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",China Pharmaceutical University; University of Arizona,"Ma, AX (通讯作者)，China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Int Pharmaceut Business, 639 Longmian St, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ma86128@sina.com,,,Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program [71603278]; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation [2016SJD630007],Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program; Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation,This project is funded by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation/Youth Program (Grant NO: 71603278) and Jiangsu Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (Grant NO: 2016SJD630007).,,48,16,16,0,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The budget feasible mechanism design problem requires the design a mechanism which incentivizes the sellers to truthfully report their cost and maximizes the buyer's value while guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her. This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in 2010. We consider the general case where the buyer's valuation is a monotone submodular function. There are a number of truthful mechanisms known for this problem. We offer two general frameworks for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly improve on the best known results, while also simplifying the analysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets (where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More generally, given an r approximation algorithm for the optimization problem (ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a r + 1 approximation mechanism for large markets, an improvement from 2r(2). We also provide a mechanism without the large market assumption, where we achieve a 4r + 1 approximation guarantee. We also show how our results can be used for the problem of a principal hiring in a Crowdsourcing Market to select a set of tasks subject to a total budget.","[Khalilabadi, Pooya Jalaly; Tardos, Eva] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Khalilabadi, PJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jalaly@cs.cornell.edu; eva@cs.cornell.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1563714, CCF-1422102]; ONR [N00014-08-1-0031]; Google Research Grant",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated),"P.

Previous work has shown that several well-known tournament solutions almost never rule out any alternative in large random tournaments. Nevertheless, all analytical results thus far have assumed a rigid probabilistic model, in which either a tournament is chosen uniformly at random, or there is a linear order of alternatives and the orientation of all edges in the tournament is chosen with the same probabilities according to the linear order. In this work, we consider a significantly more general model where the orientation of different edges can be chosen with different probabilities.

We introduce the combinatorial assortment problem, where each customer may select a bundle of products. We consider a choice model in which each consumer selects a utility-maximizing bundle subject to a private valuation function, and study the complexity of the resulting optimization problem. Our main result is an exact algorithm for k-additive valuations, under a model of vertical differentiation in which customers agree on the relative value of each pair of items but differ in their absolute willingness to pay. For valuations that are vertically differentiated but not necessarily k-additive, we show how to obtain constant approximations under a well-priced condition, where each product's price is sufficiently high. We further show that even for a single customer with known valuation, any sub-polynomial approximation to the problem requires exponentially many demand queries when the valuation function is XOS, and that no FPTAS exists even when the valuation is succinctly representable.","[Immorlica, Nicole; Lucier, Brendan; Syrgkanis, Vasilis] Microsoft Res, Boston, MA USA; [Mao, Jieming] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tzamos, Christos] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",Microsoft; University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Mao, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nicimm@microsoft.com; brlucier@microsoft.com; maojm517@gmail.com; vasy@microsoft.com; ctzamos@gmail.com,,"Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069",,,,,17,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316,,,,,,218,231,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_15,0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000865933000015,0

We study both social welfare and profit maximization with revealed preferences. Although social welfare maximization is a seemingly non-convex optimization problem in prices, we show that (i) it can be reduced to a dual convex optimization problem in prices, and (ii) the revealed preferences can be interpreted as supergradients of the concave conjugate of valuation, with which subgradients of the dual function can be computed. We thereby obtain a simple subgradient-based algorithm for strongly concave valuations and convex cost, with query complexity O(m(2)/epsilon(2)), where epsilon is the additive difference between the social welfare induced by our algorithm and the optimum social welfare. We also study social welfare maximization under the online setting, specifically the random permutation model, where consumers arrive one-by-one in a random order. For the case where consumer valuations can be arbitrary continuous functions, we propose a price posting mechanism that achieves an expected social welfare up to an additive factor of O(root mn) from the maximum social welfare. Finally, for profit maximization (which may be non-convex in simple cases), we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the query complexity for separable valuations and cost (i.e., each good can be treated independently).","[Ji, Ziwei; Mehta, Ruta; Telgarsky, Matus] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ji, ZW (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ziweiji2@illinois.edu; rutameht@illinois.edu; mjt@illinois.edu,,,,,,,36,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316,,,,,,264,281,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_18,0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000865933000018,0

We use the standard model for risk from expected utility theory, where risk-loving behavior is represented by a convex utility function. We focus our attention on the special case of exponential utility functions. We characterize the optimal auction and show that randomization can be used to extract more revenue than when buyers are risk-neutral. Most importantly, we show that the optimal auction is simple: the optimal revenue can be extracted using a randomized take-it-or-leave-it price for a single buyer and using a loser-pay auction, a variant of the all-pay auction, for multiple buyers.

We form new algorithms to do this in the presence of only ordinal information, i.e., when the true costs or distances from the agents to the facilities are unknown, and only the ordinal preferences of the agents for the facilities are available. The main difference between our work and previous work in this area is that while we assume that only ordinal information about agent preferences is known, we know the exact locations of the possible facilities F. Due to this extra information about the facilities, we are able to form powerful algorithms which have small distortion, i.e., perform almost as well as omniscient algorithms but use only ordinal information about agent preferences. For example, we present natural social choice mechanisms for choosing a single facility to open with distortion of at most 3 for minimizing both the total and the median social cost; this factor is provably the best possible. We analyze many general problems including matching, k-center, and k-median, and present black-box reductions from omniscient approximation algorithms with approximation factor beta to ordinal algorithms with approximation factor 1+ 2 beta; doing this gives new ordinal algorithms for many important problems, and establishes a toolkit for analyzing such problems in the future.","[Anshelevich, Elliot; Zhu, Wennan] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Anshelevich, E; Zhu, WN (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",eanshel@cs.rpi.edu; zhuw5@rpi.edu,,,NSF [CCF-1527497],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Onkar Bhardwaj for discussion of the lower bound example for the k-median problem.

We show that for the natural class of Monotone Hazard Rate (MHR) distributions, offering the same, take-it-or-leave-it price to all bidders can achieve an (asymptotically) optimal revenue. In particular, the approximation ratio is shown to be 1+ O(ln ln n/ ln n), matched by a tight lower bound for the case of exponential distributions. This improves upon the previously best-known upper bound of e/(e - 1) approximate to 1.58 for the slightly more general class of regular distributions. In the worst case (over n), we still show a global upper bound of 1.35. We give a simple, closed-form description of our prices which, interestingly enough, relies only on minimal knowledge of the prior distribution, namely just the expectation of its second-highest order statistic.","[Giannakopoulos, Yiannis] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Zhu, Keyu] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Technical University of Munich; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Giannakopoulos, Y (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",yiannis.giannakopoulos@tum.de; keyu.zhu@gatech.edu,,"Giannakopoulos, Yiannis/0000-0003-2382-1779",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation with funds from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
