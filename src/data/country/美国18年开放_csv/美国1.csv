One interesting result is that in both the actual marketplace and in the laboratory bargaining game, women in the matrilineal society earn more than men, at odds with years of evidence observed in the western world. We find that this result is critically driven by which side of the market the person is occupying: female (male) sellers in the matrilineal (patriarchal) society extract more of the bargaining surplus than male (female) sellers. In the buyer role, however, we observe no significant differences across societies.","[Andersen, Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Finance, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Andersen, Steffen] CPER, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Ertac, Seda] Koc Univ, Dept Econ, 34450 Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gneezy, Uri] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [List, John A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [List, John A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Maximiano, Sandra] Univ Lisbon, Dept Econ, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal",Copenhagen Business School; Koc University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidade de Lisboa,"Andersen, S (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Finance, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Andersen, S (通讯作者)，CPER, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",san.fi@cbs.dk; sertac@ku.edu.tr; ugneezy@ucsd.edu; jlist@uchicago.edu; smaximiano@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Andersen, Steffen/B-1646-2014","Ertac, Seda/0000-0002-5077-5555; List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848",Danish Social Science Research Council [11-104456]; European Research Council [639383]; European Commission (IRG) [FP-7 239529]; European Research Council (ERC) [639383] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Danish Social Science Research Council; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Commission (IRG); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would like to thank participants at the 2012 Latin American Meeting of the Econometric Society for helpful comments.

While the rational expectations revolution has allowed for great leaps in macroeconomic modeling, the surveyed empirical microevidence appears increasingly at odds with the full-information rational expectation assumption. We explore models of expectation formation that can potentially explain why and how survey data deviate from full-information rational expectations. Using the New Keynesian Phillips curve as an extensive case study, we demonstrate how incorporating survey data on inflation expectations can address a number of otherwise puzzling shortcomings that arise under the assumption of full-information rational expectations.","[Coibion, Olivier] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Coibion, Olivier; Gorodnichenko, Yuriy] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gorodnichenko, Yuriy; Kamdar, Rupal] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Coibion, O (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Coibion, O (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Gorodnichenko, Yuriy/ABD-5366-2021",,,,,,160,118,128,1,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Our model, which identifies the effect of quality on trade that arises on the demand side, through the relationship between income and quality choice, predicts that a negative income shock disproportionately reduces the demand for higher relative to lower quality traded goods (a flight from quality). Using a unique dataset of firm-level wine exports for an emerging market economy, Argentina, combined with experts wine ratings as a measure of quality, we find strong evidence of a flight from quality as we show that the values, volumes, unit values, and markups of higher quality exports contracted more sharply during the crisis. Our results imply that the exports of countries producing higher quality goods are likely to collapse more severely during recessions.","[Chen, Natalie] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Chen, Natalie] CAGE, London, England; [Chen, Natalie] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Chen, Natalie] CEPR, London, England; [Juvenal, Luciana] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Warwick; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund,"Chen, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",N.A.Chen@warwick.ac.uk; ljuvenal@imf.org,,,International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; ESRC [ES/P00766X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the co-editor Nathan Nunn and to two anonymous referees for their detailed comments.

A crucial challenge in understanding what lies behind this 'productivity puzzle' is the still short time span for which data can be analysed. An exception is Italy, where productivity growth started to stagnate 25 years ago. The Italian case can therefore offer useful insights to understand the global productivity slowdown. We find that resource misallocation has played a sizeable role in slowing down Italian productivity growth. If misallocation had remained at its 1995 level, in 2013 Italy's aggregate productivity would have been 18% higher than its actual level. Misallocation has mainly risen within sectors rather than between them, increasing more in sectors where the world technological frontier has expanded faster. Relative specialization in those sectors explains the patterns of misallocation across geographical areas and firm size classes. The broader message is that an important part of the explanation of the productivity puzzle may lie in the rising difficulty of reallocating resources across firms within sectors where technology is changing faster rather than between sectors with different speeds of technological change.","[Calligaris, Sara] OECD, Paris, France; EIEF, Rome, Italy; Univ G dAnnunzio, Pescara, Italy; CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; Bank Italy, CEP, Rome, Italy; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; London Sch Econ, London, England; Univ Bocconi Milan CEP, Milan, Italy; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; LUISS, EIEF, Rome, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Luiss Guido Carli University,"Calligaris, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,"Del Gatto, Massimo/ABG-4159-2021; Hassan, Fadi/AAL-2047-2021","Del Gatto, Massimo/0000-0002-3261-8038",Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) of the European Commission; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor Tommaso Monacelli, four anonymous referees, and our discussants, Alberto Martin and Kurt Mitman, for detailed feedback that greatly improved the paper.

Food insecurity, health status, crime, poor behavior and test scores track these cycles. This paper leverages new data from the USDA-the FoodAPS survey-to better understand these cycles in three ways. First, I find that expenditure and consumption cycles are correlated within households-a fact not previously established. Second, I study diet quality over the benefit month, and find that it worsens, potentially compounding the harmful consequences of cyclical food insecurity. Third, I find that kids bear less of the burden of the consumption cycle than adults, and that much of this difference may be driven by school-meal programs. This finding suggests large potential gains in child welfare from expanding summer meal programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One option is to pay a single price for biomass collected field-side (processor collection). Another is to pay a single price for biomass at the plant gate (supplier delivery). The literature in this area is relatively young, but there is a sense that the evolution of contracting and pricing structures will dictate the industry's success, and ultimately the costs of producing biofuels from dedicated and non-dedicated energy crops. We examine the collection and pricing choices for a cost-minimizing cellulosic biofuel processor, who initially has monopsony power in feedstock procurement in their collection area. We derive optimal prices, total expenditures on feedstocks, and the collection areas required to meet a processor's fixed input needs. We show that while societal welfare is greatest under supplier delivery; however, the processor will be indifferent between supplier delivery and processor collection unless they are concerned about entry of a competing processor. When this is the case, the processor can use the processor-collection mechanism as an effective deterrent to entry. Numerical simulation based on corn stover for biomass is used to illustrate optimal pricing and the extent of biomass collection areas for different procurement and pricing strategies. We use these findings to calculate the rates at which collection costs increase for a monopsonistic stover processor constrained to a defined procurement area, as might emerge as the industry moves toward commercialization. The derived marginal cost curve for a monopsonistic processor of stover is compared with the marginal cost curve across alternative feedstocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a widely-used version, a regression for log consumption calibrates a PMT score based on covariates, which is then implemented for targeting out-of-sample. The performance of various PMT methods is assessed using data for nine African countries. Standard PMTs help filter out the non-poor, but exclude many poor people, thus diminishing the impact on poverty. Poverty-focused econometric methods such as using quantile regression generally do better. We also characterize the optimal informationally-feasible solution for poverty targeting and compare it to econometric methods. Even with a budget sufficient to eliminate poverty with full information, none of the targeting methods studied bring the poverty rate below about three-quarters of its initial value. The prevailing methods are particularly deficient in reaching the poorest. A basic-income scheme or transfers using a simple demographic scorecard often do as well, or even better, in reducing poverty.","[Brown, Caitlin] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Brown, Caitlin; Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [van de Walle, Dominique] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Central European University; Georgetown University; The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mr1185@georgetown.edu,,"Brown, Caitlin/0000-0001-7322-8389",World Banks Strategic Research Program,World Banks Strategic Research Program,"For their comments the authors thank Arthur Alik-Lagrange, Kathleen Beegle, Mary Ann Bronson, Raphael Calel, Phillippe Leite, Xavier Gabaix, Essama Nssah, Mead Over, Mark Schreiner, Don Sillers, Adam Wagstaff and seminar participants at Aix-Marseille School of Economics, Georgetown University, the International Monetary Fund, the Paris School of Economics, Trinity College Dublin, University of Califomia, Riverside, and the World Bank.

Consistent with the happiness results, we also find that relative to Catholics, Protestants and non-believers, those of Eastern Orthodox religion have less social capital and prefer old ideas and safe jobs. In addition, Orthodoxy is associated with left-leaning political preferences and stronger support for government involvement in the economy. Compared to non-believers and Orthodox adherents, Catholics and Protestants are less likely to agree that government ownership is a good thing, and Protestants are less likely to agree that getting rich can only happen at the expense of others. These differences in life satisfaction and other attitudes and values persisted despite the fact that communist elites sought to eradicate church-going in Eastern Europe, since communists maintained many aspects of Orthodox theology which were useful for the advancement of the communist doctrine.

Credit constraints are derived from incentive constraints in optimal contracts which ensure default never occurs in equilibrium.

I model the financial sector as a large number of investors divided into different groups, which I interpret as financial institutions, and a large number of dealers. Financial institutions and dealers trade assets in an OTC market a la Duffie et al. (2005) and Lagos and Rocheteau (2009). Investors receive privately observed preference shocks, and financial institutions use the balanced team mechanism, proposed by Athey and Segal (2013), to implement an efficient risk-sharing arrangement among their investors. When the market is liquid, in the sense that search and bargaining are small frictions, I show that the economy is likely to have a unique equilibrium and, therefore, is not fragile. When these frictions are severe, a run equilibrium exists-investors announce low valuation of assets because they believe everyone else in their financial institution is doing the same. Conditional on bank runs existing, the welfare impact of the search friction is ambiguous. During runs, trade is inefficient, and, as a result, a friction that reduces trade during runs has the potential to improve welfare. This result is in sharp contrast with the existing literature, which suggests that search friction has a negative impact on welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Fiscal rules are deficit limits that trade off commitment to not overspend and flexibility to react to shocks. We compare coordinated rules, chosen jointly by a group of countries, to uncoordinated rules. If governments' present bias is small, coordinated rules are tighter than uncoordinated rules: individual countries do not internalize the redistributive effect of interest rates. However, if the bias is large, coordinated rules are slacker: countries do not internalize the disciplining effect of interest rates.

The key identification challenge is that the composition of a school board is potentially correlated with unobserved determinants of school segregation. We overcome this issue using a regression discontinuity design at the electoral contest level, exploiting quasi-random variation from narrowly-decided elections. Such an approach is made possible by a unique dataset, which combines matched information about North Carolina school board candidates with time-varying district-level racial and economic segregation outcomes. Focusing on the political identity of school board members, regression discontinuity estimates reveal that (relative to their non-Democratic counterparts) Democratic board members decrease racial segregation across schools. Our findings suggest that school boards realize such reductions in segregation by shifting attendance zones (which we infer without the need for exact geocoded boundaries) and that white families differentially exit the traditional public school system for local charter schools in response.

We find that unexpected losses increase sentence lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex ante have no impact. The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants. The impact of upset losses on sentence lengths is larger for defendants if their cases are handled by judges who received their bachelor's degrees from the university with which the football team is affiliated. Different falsification tests and a number of auxiliary analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings. These results provide evidence for the impact of emotions in one domain on decisions in a completely unrelated domain among a uniformly highly educated group of individuals (judges) who make decisions after deliberation that involve high stakes (sentence lengths). They also point to the existence of a subtle and previously unnoticed capricious application of sentencing.","[Eren, Ozkan; Mocan, Naci] Louisiana State Univ, EJ Ourso Coll Business, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Eren, O (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, EJ Ourso Coll Business, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",oeren@lsu.edu; mocan@lsu.edu,,,,,,,57,89,107,4,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

Macro evidence and implications for global inequality,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Wealth; Tax evasion; Tax havens,CAPITAL FLIGHT,"Drawing on newly published macroeconomic statistics, this paper estimates the amount of household wealth owned by each country in offshore tax havens. The equivalent of 10% of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15% in Continental Europe, and 60% in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies. We use these estimates to construct revised series of top wealth shares in ten countries, which account for close to half of world GDP. Because offshore wealth is very concentrated at the top, accounting for it increases the top 0.01% wealth share substantially in Europe, even in countries that do not use tax havens extensively. It has considerable effects in Russia, where the vast majority of wealth at the top is held offshore. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond tax and survey data to study wealth accumulation among the very rich in a globalized world.","[Alstadsaeter, Annette] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway; [Johannesen, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, CEBI, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zucman, Gabriel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Zucman, Gabriel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Copenhagen; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Zucman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA.;Zucman, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",annette.alstadsater@nmbu.no; niels.johannesen@econ.ku.dk; zucman@berkeley.edu,,"johannesen, niels/0000-0002-7850-2794",Nordic Tax Research Council; FRIPRO-program of the Research Council of Norway; Danish Council for Independent Research; Laura and John Arnold Foundation,Nordic Tax Research Council; FRIPRO-program of the Research Council of Norway; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Laura and John Arnold Foundation,"This paper is supplemented by an Online Appendix available at http://gabriel-zucman.eu/offshore.

While both Britain and the US have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in Britain while it has risen in the US. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the US and on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the US mean this growing group has seen particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.

We consider a version of the Barro-Gordon credibility problem in which monetary policy signals an inflation-biased CB's private information on both these dimensions. We find that greater CB competence-more private information-about policy objectives is desirable while greater competence about operational shocks need not be. When the CB has less private information about operational shocks, the public infers that monetary policy depends more on the CB's information about objectives.

In particular, agents need not be globally risk-averse, or uncertainty-averse in the sense of Schmeidler (1989). We identify a behavioral condition under which betting is inefficient (i.e., every Pareto-efficient allocation provides full insurance, and conversely) if and only if agents' supporting probabilities (defined as in Rigotti et al., 2008) have a non-empty intersection. Our condition is consistent with empirical and experimental evidence documenting violations of convexity in either outcomes or utilities. Our results show that the connection between speculative betting and inconsistent beliefs does not depend upon global notions of risk or ambiguity aversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This rule is applied to a variety of nontransitive preference models, such as semiorders on the commodity space, relative discounting time preferences, justifiable preferences over ambiguous acts, regret preferences over risky prospects, and collective preferences induced by majority voting.

The paper, first, points out the difficulties in Piketty's neo-classical version of explanation of US income inequality, which stresses the effect of the rising aggregate wealth-income ratio and high elasticity of factor substitution. Second, the analysis, based on a Cambridge two-class model along the lines of Kaldor (1955-56, 1966) and Pasinetti (1962), highlights the role of financialization in increasing inequality. Third, the analysis suggests that the rise in the aggregate wealth-income ratio from 1980 to 2007 in the USA is explained mostly by asset price inflation, not by technical relations. Finally, the analysis examines the effects of the slowdown in capital accumulation on income distribution and wealth-income ratios, which are very different from those in Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century.","[Ryoo, Soon] Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA",Adelphi University,"Ryoo, S (通讯作者)，Adelphi Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA.",sryoo@adelphi.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this article, we posit that voters may systematically err when assessing potential changes in policy by underappreciating how new policies lead to new equilibrium behaviour. This biases voters towards policy changes that create direct benefits-welfare would rise if behaviour were held constant-even if those reforms ultimately reduce welfare because people adjust behaviour. Conversely, voters are biased against policies that impose direct costs even if they induce larger indirect benefits. Using a lab experiment, we find that a majority of subjects vote against policies that, while inflicting direct costs, would help them to overcome social dilemmas and thereby increase welfare. Subjects also support policies that, while producing direct benefits, create social dilemmas and ultimately hurt welfare. Both mistakes arise because subjects fail to fully anticipate the equilibrium effects of new policies. More precisely, we establish that subjects systematically underappreciate the extent to which policy changes will affect the behaviour of other people, and that these mistaken beliefs exert a causal effect on the demand for bad policy.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Eyster, Erik] LSE, London, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,ERC,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Alexander Kiam, Jeongbin Kim, Daniel Prinz, Santiago Truffa and Stephen Yen for excellent research assistance as well as Berkeley's XLab and Brown's BUSSELfor support.

In response to positive productivity shocks, risk premia fall and the sovereign borrows to finance investment. When adverse productivity shocks make international borrowing expensive, the sovereign responds by rolling over debt and reducing investment. This causes output to fall and the debt-output ratio to increase, and default occurs if the negative shocks continue long enough. Consequently, the model generates first an increase and then a decrease in investment, consumption, and output prior to default, as in the data. These relationships between productivity, spreads, investment, and borrowing also make the model consistent with many features of small open economy business cycles such as countercyclical spreads and net exports. While capital has nontrivial effects on the incentive to default, increased capital almost always reduces risk premia in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We find that there is a range of parameters in the identified setwhen judges tend to disagree ex ante or their private information is imprecisein which deliberation can be beneficial; otherwise, deliberation reduces the effectiveness of the court.","[Iaryczower, Matias] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Shi, Xiaoxia] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Shum, Matthew] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Princeton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; California Institute of Technology,"Iaryczower, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,"shi, xiaoxia/0009-0000-2803-3232","National Science Foundation [SES-1061326, SES-1061266]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to Maria Goltsman, Navin Kartik, Alessandro Lizzeri, Adam Meirowitz, Greg Pavlov, Alejandro Robinson Cortes, Leeat Yariv, and seminar participants at Columbia, Emory, Erasmus University's Workshop in Political Economy 2012, Higher School of Economics (Russia), New York University, Princeton, Seoul National, Singapore Management, Sogang, Stanford (Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics 2012), University College London, Chicago, Montreal, Penn, Western Ontario, and Washington University for comments.

Legal scholars argue that if penalties for errors are severe, officers may become timid while policing (thereby encouraging crime). We evaluate these arguments in a model where officers invest in competence. Competence increases the officer's ability to identify criminals. Low sanctions for errors encourages bold policing by officers but may still raise the equilibrium level of crime because it also discourages investments in competence. Granting immunity to only competent officers (qualified immunity) reduces both errors and crimes when competence is observable.

Impacts varied predictably with prior development - prior roads and prior deforestation and, further, in a pattern that suggests a potential synergy for roads between forests and urban growth. For multiple periods of roads investments, the authors estimate forest impacts for high, medium and low prior roads and deforestation. For each setting, census-tract observations are numerous. Results confirm predictions for this kind of frontier of a pattern not consistent with endogeneity, i.e., short-run forest impacts of new roads are: small for relatively high prior development; larger for medium prior development; and small for low prior development (for the latter setting, impacts in such isolated areas could rise over time, depending on interactions with conservation policies). These Amazonian results suggest 'SDG strategic' locations for infrastructure, an idea the authors note for other frontiers while highlighting major differences across frontiers and their SDG opportunities.","[Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Robalino, Juan] CATIE EfD, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Robalino, Juan] Univ Costa Rica, San Pedro Montes De Oca, Costa Rica; [Reis, Eustaquio J.] IPEA Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Walker, Robert] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Perz, Stephen] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Laurance, William] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bohrer, Claudio] Univ Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Aldrich, Steven] Indiana State Univ, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Arima, Eugenio] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Caldas, Marcellus] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Kirby, Katherine] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",Duke University; Universidad Costa Rica; Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; James Cook University; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Indiana State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Kansas State University; University of Toronto,"Pfaff, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",alex.pfaff@duke.edu,"Laurance, William F/B-2709-2012; Bohrer, Claudio/Q-3216-2017; Caldas, Marcellus M/C-1955-2014","Laurance, William F/0000-0003-4430-9408; Bohrer, Claudio/0000-0002-1217-5006;",NASA LBA; Tinker Foundation; EfD centers,NASA LBA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Tinker Foundation; EfD centers,"For financial support we thank the NASA LBA (project led by R.

In these three countries, goods and credit market frictions play a dominant role in entry costs and account for 75% to 85% of the total entry costs. In the goods market, adverse supply shocks are amplified through their propagation to the demand side, as they also imply income losses for consumers. This adds up to, at most, an additional 15% to 25% to the impact of the shocks. Finally, the speed of matching in the goods market and the credit market accounts for a small fraction of unemployment: most variation in unemployment comes from the speed of matching in the labor market.

Macroeconomics since the crisis,OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,macroeconomic models; pricing behaviour; measurement and data,INFLATION,"This paper argues that when the financial crisis came policy-makers relied on some version of the Hicksian sticky-price IS-LM as their default model; these models were 'good enough for government work'. While there have been many incremental changes suggested to the DSGE model, there has been no single 'big new idea' because the even simpler IS-LM type models were what worked well. In particular, the policy responses based on IS-LM were appropriate. Specifically, these models generated the insights that large budget deficits would not drive up interest rates and, while the economy remained at the zero lower bound, that very large increases in monetary base wouldn't be inflationary, and that the multiplier on government spending was greater than 1. The one big exception to this satisfactory understanding was in price behaviour. A large output gap was expected to lead to a large fall in inflation, but did not. If new research is necessary, it is on pricing behaviour. While there was a failure to forecast the crisis, it did not come down to a lack of understanding of possible mechanisms, or of a lack of data, but rather through a lack of attention to the right data.","[Krugman, Paul] CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Krugman, P (通讯作者)，CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pkrugman@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,11,30,31,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Our analysis tells a story of bad trade policies, rooted in distributional conflict and shaped by changes in constraints, that favored industry over agriculture in a country with a fundamental comparative advantage in agriculture. While the anti-export bias impeded productivity growth in agriculture, the import substitution strategy was not successful in promoting an efficient industrialization.

We take advantage of variation in the partisan composition of Congressional districts stemming from Census-initiated redistricting in the 1990's, 2000's, and 2010's to examine how an increase in Democrat share within a district impacts the district representative's roll call voting. We find that an increase in Democrat share within a district causes more leftist roll call voting. This increase occurs because a Democrat is more likely to hold the seat, but also because - in contrast to existing empirical work - partisan composition has a direct effect on the roll call voting of individual representatives. The finding holds for both Democrats and Republicans. It is also true regardless of the nature of the redistricting (e.g., whether the redistricting was generated by a partisan or non-partisan process).

Donald Trump proposed cutting taxes to provide tax relief for middle-class Americans, and lowering corporation taxes to boost economic growth, while Hillary Clinton proposed modest increases in taxes on high-income Americans, with a view to increasing the fairness of the tax code. We have simulated the effects of these two proposals, using a two-tier modeling design, with a large dynamic computable general equilibrium model to address the macroeconomic magnitudes, linked to a micro-simulation tax calculator model to measure the distributional effects. The Trump proposals would boost economic growth, but sharpening the incentives to work and to save/invest would be regressive, with 70% of the benefits accruing to those in the top income decile. The budget deficit could only be maintained if spending were to be cut sharply; and if spending were reduced more modestly, the deficit would rise greatly. The Clinton proposals would have little net effect on 90% of households, which is at odds with her promise of tax relief for working people, but would reduce net income in the top decile by almost 2%. They would slow economic growth slightly. Although he was elected president, Donald Trump's proposals are likely to be altered, mainly so that the budgetary effects are much smaller, before being presented to Congress. But the rationale, shape, and tone of the proposals will likely remain the same.","[Bhattarai, Keshab] Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England; [Bachman, Paul; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Bachman, Paul; Conte, Frank; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Beacon Hill Inst, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Head, Michael] IBM Watson Hlth, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Hull; Suffolk University; Suffolk University,"Bhattarai, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England.",K.R.Bhattarai@hull.ac.uk; pbachman@beaconhill.org; fconte@eastboston.com; jhaughton@suffolk.edu; dtuerck@beaconhill.org,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",NCPA [NCPA-DCGE-2015/16],NCPA,Authors appreciate the NCPA (NCPA-DCGE-2015/16) grant for a project on the dynamic CGE model for tax policy analysis of the US.

Sellers report accurate beliefs about recipient allocations and do not report feeling less responsible the more often they sell the allocation right.

By doing so, sellers can exploit their local monopoly power by adjusting prices or quantities once the local demand is realized. We find that when sellers can adjust quantities ex-post, there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium where an increase in the buyer-seller ratio leads to higher quantities and prices. When buyers instead can choose quantities ex-post, a higher buyer-seller ratio leads to higher prices but lower traded quantities. These equilibrium allocations are generically constrained inefficient in both intensive and extensive margins. When sellers post ex-ante quantities and adjust prices ex-post, a symmetric equilibrium exists where buyers obtain no surplus from trade. This equilibrium allocation is not constrained efficient either.

Patient selection, physician price sensitivity, and prices",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; HMOs spending; Prescription drug demand,CARE; HEALTH; INCENTIVES,"Cost-control incentives have become an important part of the health insurance landscape in the United States. These incentives are the strongest in capitated managed care organizations, especially HMOs, because such organizations are paid a fixed amount regardless of the spending they generate. Using a sample of insurance claims from about 500 plans, I find that in HMOs, spending on anti-cholesterol drugs is 19% lower than in other insurance plans. This spending difference could reflect the strong cost-control incentives generated by capitation, but it could also reflect the selection of healthy, price-sensitive patients into HMOs, or it could simply reflect lower prices. To understand the difference, I estimate a model of physician prescribing and patient refill decisions. Patients in HMOs are nearly twice as sensitive to copays as are other patients, consistent with selection of healthy patients into HMOs. Even after adjusting for this selection, however, HMO physicians remain highly sensitive to drug procurement costs. This high sensitivity explains about a 20% of the spending difference; combined with lower prices, it explains about 25-55% of the difference. I find no evidence that these spending reductions result in fewer patient refills or the prescribing of less effective statins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A committee convened at time t decides on consumption at t, accounting for the behaviour of future committees. Committee members disagree about the appropriate value of the pure rate of time preference, but must nevertheless reach a decision. If each committee aggregates its members' preferences in a utilitarian manner, the collective preferences of successive committees will be time inconsistent, and they will implement inefficient consumption plans. If however committees decide on the level of consumption by a majoritarian vote in each period, they may improve on the consumption plans implemented by utilitarian committees. Using a simple model, we show that this occurs in empirically plausible cases. Application to the problem of choosing the social discount rate is discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Evidence from an Experiment on Bundling Microcredit and Insurance,ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH-INSURANCE; IMPACTS,"Randomized controlled trials have found only modest effects of microfinance, but these studies focus on new clients. Existing estimates may thus understate ongoing gains for more experienced borrowers and the longer-run potential of microfinance. We estimate impacts of microfinance on experienced borrowers, using an episode when a microfinance institution modestly increased existing clients' fees in randomly selected villages (in exchange for a mandatory health insurance policy that turned out to be useless). This increase in fees led to a 22 percentage point decline in loan renewal in treatment villages (95% confidence interval: 16 to 27), compared to control villages where the policy was not introduced. Using this randomly generated variation in microfinance participation among experienced borrowers, we find impacts of microfinance that are strikingly similar to previous estimates for new clients: neither business outcomes nor household consumption were affected, on average. Also, consistent with prior studies, we find significant impacts on business outcomes among clients who had started their businesses before microfinance entered the village (0.06 standard deviation decline in an index of business outcomes from the loss of microfinance, 95% confidence interval: -0.002 to -0.12). However, despite these measured losses, these clients were just as willing to give up microfinance.","[Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hornbeck, Richard] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,National Institutes of Health [PO1 HD061315-04]; MIT [0609001924]; Harvard University [F18180-104],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); MIT; Harvard University,"This project received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant PO1 HD061315-04), and received IRB approval from MIT (#0609001924) and Harvard University (#F18180-104).

We explore this question in rural Pakistan, showing that greater political competition in a Provincial Assembly (PA) constituency predicts significantly better access to publicly-provided infrastructure and amenities, but no changes in other public goods including perceived access to justice and security. Nonetheless, overall welfare effects appear to be positive: higher political competition predicts higher expenditures per capita, especially among land-poor households. It also predicts higher land values, greater land wealth, and lower land wealth inequality. Further, political competition increases land rental, possibly indicating improved functionality of land markets. Sensitivity analyses suggest that our estimates are unlikely to be substantially affected by omitted variable bias, and they are further similar to instrumental variables estimates. The findings are also robust to use of alternate measures of political competition. Greater provision of both public and private goods appears to explain welfare improvements.","[Kosec, Katrina; Spielman, David J.; Zaidi, Fatima] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 1 St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Haider, Hamza] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University,"Kosec, K (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 1 St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",k.kosec@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; US Agency for International Development [AID-391-IO-11-00002]","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR); US Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This work was supported by the the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the US Agency for International Development [Cooperative Agreement # AID-391-IO-11-00002].",,81,7,7,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

To empirically examine how interpersonal comparisons affect productivity, this study utilizes a lab-in-the-field experiment that was conducted in Bolivia among 285 dairy farmers. The experiment consists of a baseline effort-elicitation and three treatments. The first treatment reveals to participants their baseline rankings; the second treatment allows participants to pay to destroy the output of others in their group; and the third treatment introduces inequity by placing a randomly-chosen group member into a more favorable production setting. This paper reports three main findings. First, in the absence of destructive actions, low-productivity participants increase their productivity whereas high-productivity participants decrease their productivity. Second, more than half of the participants are willing to give up their earnings to destroy the output of their peers. Finally, those who were placed into a more favorable production setting have a 29% higher probability of being destroyed by somebody in their group, showing evidence of destructive actions being motivated by a sense of fairness.","[Zeballos, Eliana] USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zeballos, E (通讯作者)，USDA, ERS, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",eliana.zeballos@gmail.com,"Zeballos, Eliana/IAP-5174-2023","Zeballos, Eliana/0000-0002-5229-7948","Hemispheric Institute of the Americas Field Research Grant; Henry A.

When setting non-binding goals for a multi-stage project, an agent must decide how to group, or bracket, such goals for evaluation. He can bracket broadly by setting an aggregate goal for the entire project, or narrowly by setting incremental goals for individual stages.

In this paper we characterize surplus-maximizing (efficient) and revenue-maximizing (optimal) mechanisms in a spectrum sharing context where a principal allocates transmitted power among a group of potentially interested users (transmitter-receiver pairs). Under regularity conditions about value distributions and non-interference constraints, we show that efficiency (optimality) typically involves spectrum sharing by multiple users, and the exact allocation of transmitted power is determined such that the ratio of marginal value (virtual value) over marginal cost (in terms of the cost to the interference generated) is equal among all shared users. We show that efficient and optimal mechanisms in our setting are actually dominant-strategy incentive compatible, and that they can also be implemented by well-designed all-pay or discriminatory-price auctions.

In contrast, a more classical measure, a substantially increased interest rate, has no effect for most participants and raises the savings balance only for the very top of the distribution.

In this paper we provide new evidence about the long-run evolution of top wealth shares for the United Kingdom. The new series covers a long period - from 1895 to the present- and has a different point of departure from the previous literature: we start with the analysis of the distribution of estates left at death. We find that the application to the estate data of mortality multipliers to yield estimates of wealth among the living does not substantially change the degree of concentration over much of the period both in the UK and US, allowing inferences to be made for years when this method cannot be applied. The results show that wealth concentration in the UK remained relatively constant during the first wave of globalization, but then decreased dramatically in the period from 1914 to 1979. The UK went from being more unequal in terms of wealth than the US to being less unequal. However, the decline in UK wealth concentration came to an end around 1980, and since then there is evidence of an increase in top shares, notably in the distribution of wealth excluding housing in recent years. We investigate the triangulating evidence provided by data on capital income concentration and on reported super fortunes.","[Alvaredo, Facundo] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] INET, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, Nuffield Coll, London, England; CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Morelli, Salvatore] CUNY, Stone Ctr Socioecon Inequal, New York, NY USA",Paris School of Economics; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，INET, Oxford, England.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England.",alvaredo@pse.ens.fr,"Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00023]; European Research Council [340831]; ESRC/DFID [ES/I033114/1]; University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; ESRC [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [340831] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Institute for New Economic Thinking; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC/DFID(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Venice Ca Foscari Guido Cazzavillan Fellowship; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We acknowledge financial support, at different stages, from the Institute for New Economic Thinking (F.

We find that while the entry and exit of firms and their product-portfolio choices exert countervailing forces over long-run total factor productivity (TFP), they reinforce each other in shaping the welfare gains from reversing misallocation.

Interpreting greater contributions as generosity, this has been seen as evidence of generosity being intuitive. We caution that fast decisions are more prone to error, and that mistakes, rather than preferences, may drive the observed comparative static. Varying the location of the equilibrium in public-good games with a unique dominant strategy, we show that the location of the equilibrium determines whether contributions are larger for fast decision-makers than for slow decision-makers. Replicating previous results, we find that fast decision-makers give more than slow decision-makers when the equilibrium is below the mid-point of the strategy set, but that this result is reversed when the equilibrium is above the mid-point. Consistent with fast decisions being more prone to error, we find that individuals who make (or have to make) fast decisions are insensitive to incentives, more often make mistakes, and are less likely to make equilibrium contributions. These findings make clear that we must control for the rate of errors if we are to draw inference on preferences from response time.","[Recalde, Maria P.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Riedl, Arno] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vesterlund, Lise] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Vesterlund, Lise] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Melbourne; Maastricht University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Vesterlund, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",vester@pitt.edu,,"Recalde, Maria P/0000-0001-7127-1607",,,,,82,31,31,3,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Using the methodology developed in Kehoe and Ruhl (2013), we define the set of least-traded goods as those that account for the lowest 10% of total exports and imports in 1995, and then trace its growth in several markets including the Baltics' main trade partners, the European Union and Russia. We find that, on average, by 2008 least-traded goods accounted for nearly 50% of total Baltic exports to their main trade partners. Moreover, we find that increases in the share of least traded exports coincided with the timing of the trade liberalization reforms implemented by the Baltic countries. Least-traded imports also grew at robust rates, but their growth was lower than that of exports, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of total imports, that is, about half of the exports value. Moreover, we find that the shares of least traded imports from the EU 15 and from Russia started diverging around the time the Baltic countries joined the EU, with the EU 15 share increasing and the Russian one declining. We also find that the Baltics' share of least-traded exports outpaced that of other economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Finally, exports of new goods from the Baltic countries suffered noticeably during the Global Financial Crisis. After the crisis ended, the restart in new goods exports growth displayed mixed patterns.

Is the corresponding Shapley value mechanism optimal in some sense? We consider the objective of minimizing worst-case inefficiency subject to a revenue constraint, and prove results in three different regimes. First, for the public excludable good problem, the Shapley value mechanism minimizes the worst-case efficiency loss over all truthful, deterministic, and budget-balanced mechanisms that satisfy equal treatment. Second, even with randomization and approximate budget-balance allowed and dropping equal treatment, the worst-case efficiency loss of the Shapley value mechanism is within a constant factor of the minimum possible. Third, for no-deficit mechanisms, we prove a general positive result: for every monotone cost function, a suitable blend of the VCG and Shapley value mechanisms is no-deficit and enjoys good approximate efficiency guarantees.

The first is a pure banking regime, in which firms borrow from banks for financing costs of labor, investment and intermediate goods for both the relatively riskless natural-resource traded sector and the non-traded sector. The second regime is more financially-inclusive banking/crowdfunding (BCF) regime, in which the households directly receive returns to capital from pooled lending to home-goods firms. Simulation results show that the banking regime better insulates the economy from negative shocks but limits the upside gain from positive shocks which would take place in the banking-crowdfunding regime.","[McNelis, Paul D.] Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Fordham University; Keio University,"McNelis, PD (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, New York, NY 10023 USA.",mcnelis@fordham.edu; nyoshino@adbi.org,,"McNelis, Paul D./0000-0001-9519-2372; Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,25,2,2,0,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

They show that as agents become patient enough, for any prior belief about the type of the privately informed seller, in any stationary equilibrium, prices in all transactions converge to the highest possible valuation of the informed seller. In the model, it was assumed that the privately informed seller's type is distributed on a two-point support. In this note, we argue that the asymptotic uniqueness result also holds when the privately informed seller's valuation is distributed on a continuous support.

We find that migrants who have come from within the province differ significantly from those who have come from outside of the province. Using a nested logit model, we find that overall, higher wage differentials, larger population size, higher GDP per capita, and faster employment growth rate are the attributes of a city that attract rural-to-urban migrants. In addition, moving beyond one's home province has a strong deterrent effect on migration, analogous to the border effect identified in international migration studies. We also explore the role of culture, institutional barriers, and dialect in explaining such a pronounced border effect.","[Su, Yaqin] Hunan Univ, Ctr Econ Finance & Management Studies, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tesfazion, Petros] Cent Coll, Pella, IA USA; [Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Renmin University of China,"Zhao, Z (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yaqinsu@hnu.edu.cn; ptesfazion@yahoo.com; zhao.zhong@ruc.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X; su, yaqin/0000-0003-2840-646X",Renmin University of China: the special developing and guiding fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) Project [16XNL005],Renmin University of China: the special developing and guiding fund for building world-class universities (disciplines) Project,"We are very grateful for comments from Belton M.

In addition, household consumption within the same proximity to the camp is 25% higher than in areas farther away. Price, household survey, and official statistics suggest that the mechanisms driving this positive effect are increased availability of new employment and price changes in agricultural and livestock markets that are favorable to local producers.","[Alix-Garcia, Jennifer] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Walker, Sarah] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bartlett, Anne] Univ New South Wales, Sch Humanities & Languages Int Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bartlett, Anne] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Refugee Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Onder, Harun; Sanghi, Apurva] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Oregon State University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; The World Bank,"Alix-Garcia, J (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jennifer.alix-sarcia@oregonstate.edu,"Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/W-1762-2019","Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/0000-0003-0200-0496; Walker, Sarah/0000-0002-8956-0359","University of Cantabria, Spain; World Bank [111303]","University of Cantabria, Spain; World Bank(The World Bank India)","We thank two anonymous referees for their useful comments.

In order to answer this question we characterize constrained-efficient allocations in an infinite horizon, two-good economy with limited commitment for two market structures, random pairwise meetings and centralized meetings. If agents meet bilaterally, then constrained-efficient allocations specify the highest stationary output level that is incentive feasible, and it is implemented with take-it-or-leave-it offers and not-too-tight solvency constraints. If agents meet in a centralized location, constrained-efficient allocations can be non-stationary, in which case they feature a credit boom followed by stagnation due to too-tight solvency constraints. We also characterize constrained-efficient allocations under partial commitment by the planner. If commitment is low, the economy experiences rare but pronounced credit crunches. If commitment is high, the economy experiences infrequent but large credit booms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Within countries, hours worked per worker are also decreasing in the individual wage for most countries, though in the richest countries, hours worked are flat or increasing in the wage.

A pari-mutuel mechanism produces a predicted probability distribution over box office amounts that is, with the exception of very small films, indistinguishable from the actual revenues. The second mechanism is based on guessing the guesses of others and when applied under conditions where incentives for accuracy are unavailable still performs well against data.","[Court, David] AFTRS, Moore Pk, NSW, Australia; [Gillen, Benjamin; Plott, Charles R.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [McKenzie, Jordi] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",California Institute of Technology; Macquarie University,"Plott, CR (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",cplott@hss.caltech.edu,"Mckenzie, Jordi/AFN-3907-2022","Mckenzie, Jordi/0000-0003-4081-6189",Australian Research Council [LP110200336]; Australian Research Council [LP110200336] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; the Lee Center; Australian Research Council (Linkage Grant LP110200336); University of Sydney; Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS); and the Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science.

We find that the hazard of PTSD is close to eight times higher among Marines returning from OEF/OIF compared to those never deployed, and just 1.33 times higher among those returning from HA/DR (and never participated in OEF/OIF). Those returning from OEF/OIF missions are 1.81 times more likely than those never deployed to die by suicide when they were still active duty, and the hazard increases to almost 3 after they have left the military.

The parties differ only in their redistributive preferences, with the left-wing party having a stronger preference for redistribution. Our analysis explicitly considers the possibility that society's preference for redistribution may change, as reflected in its future voting behaviour. The incumbent government respects the possibility that society's preference may change, and sets taxes to maximize expected social welfare. Our main result is that an incumbent left-wing (resp. right-wing) government will implement a regressive ( resp. progressive) savings tax policy. The incumbent government implements this policy not out of self-interest, but to accommodate the redistributive goals of the opposing party.","[Guo, Jang-Ting] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krause, Alan] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of York - UK,"Guo, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",guojt@ucr.edu; alan.krause@york.ac.uk,"Guo, Jang-Ting/AAY-8365-2021","Guo, Jang-Ting/0000-0001-9948-9691",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Towards this end, this study aimed to develop the life-cycle economic and environmental assessment model for establishing the optimal implementation strategy of the rooftop PV system. The robustness and reliability of the developed model were evaluated in terms of two perspectives: (i) for the effectiveness of the optimal solution, the optimization results were generated by considering the regional climate factors and building characteristics. Namely, the results for SIR25 (saving to investment ratio at year 25), which was set at the optimization goal, were 2.540 (Busan, southern part of South Korea), 2.485 (Daejeon, central part of South Korea), and 2.266 (Seoul, northern part of South Korea), respectively; and (ii) for the efficient computation time, the time required for determining the optimal solution was only 27 seconds.

It first examines the notion of a new combination - a core analytical concept in economic theories of innovation and explanations of emergent novelty through bottom-up processes. Following Schumpeter, different theorists have made different claims about the composition and structure of new combinations. Possible constituent elements include factors of production, capital goods, routines, information, ideas, technologies, and property rights. The article then looks synoptically at the institutional dimensions of innovation from alternative perspectives that focus upon different kinds of institutional rules and policy solutions to innovation problems. Neoclassical and evolutionary approaches tend to emphasize specific policy interventions in markets to channel behavior toward particular desired outcomes, whereas institutional and Austrian approaches tend to focus upon general institutional rules (e.g. property and contract) that frame markets and innovation processes.

Assignment to high performance pay via a market mechanism is roughly twice as effective as imposing the same contract exogenously. This positive effect is largely offset by a negative effect for workers that endogenously choose low performance pay. We decompose the positive effect of endogenous assignment to high performance pay into effects due to selection and strategic anticipation, and find that selection has a greater effect than strategic anticipation. We use a Reverse Sort treatment to show that the effect of selection is sufficiently strong to overcome the direct effect of lower performance pay, yielding coordination at high effort levels in spite of low incentives.

Gatekeeping is an essential task in many insurance systems. In this study we exploit exogenous shifts of general practitioners (GPs) occurring when physicians quit or retire. We find that these shifts induce changes in absenteeism for affected workers. By utilizing high-quality Norwegian matched employer-employee data with detailed individual information on certified sick leave during the period 2003-2012, we can study how the transfer of workers between GPs affects co-workers' absenteeism. We identify strong causal positive peer effects in absenteeism: a one day change in focal worker sickness absence transfers to a 0.41 day shift in peer absence. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The paper empirically tests the direction and strength of association of a range of objective and subjective factors with subjective well-being in the Middle East and North Africa in the years immediately preceding the Arab Spring uprisings (2009-10). The findings suggest a significant, negative association between life satisfaction levels and each of the main perceived grievances voiced during the 2011 uprisingsdissatisfaction with the standard of living, poor labor market conditions, and corruption in the form of nepotism or cronyism. The increased prevalence of dissatisfaction with the standard of living contributed the most to the decline in subjective well-being during this period, followed by worsening labor market conditions manifested in increased unemployment and decline in self-reported earnings. In addition, perceptions about corruption became more important for people's life satisfaction, particularly in the Arab Spring countries where the uprisings were most intense.","[Arampatzi, Efstratia; Burger, Martijn; Rohricht, Tina; Veenhoven, Ruut] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; The World Bank,"Arampatzi, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Happiness Econ Res Org, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",arampatzi@ese.eur.nl,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021; Veenhoven, Ruut/F-5052-2013","Veenhoven, Ruut/0000-0002-5159-393X",,,,,88,33,35,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This paper explores an additional challenge, for monetary policy. Although remittances expand bank balance sheets, providing a stable flow of interest-insensitive funding, they tend to increase banks' holdings of liquid assets. This both reduces the need for an interbank market and severs the link between policy rate and banks' marginal cost of funds, thus shutting down a major transmission channel. We develop a stylized model based on asymmetric information and a lack of transparent borrowers and undertake econometric analysis providing evidence that increased remittance inflows are associated with weaker transmission. As independent monetary policy becomes impaired, this result is consistent with earlier findings that recipient countries tend to favor fixed exchange rate regimes.","[Barajas, Adolfo; Chami, Ralph; Ebeke, Christian; Oeking, Anne] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Oeking, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",abarajas@imf.org; rchami@imf.org; cebeke@imf.org; aoeking@imf.org,,,,,,,37,11,13,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Individuals assigned to the treatment group of our experiment received a brochure that informed them about job search strategies and the consequences of unemployment, and motivated them to actively look for new employment. We study the causal impact of the brochure by comparing labor market outcomes of treated and untreated job seekers in administrative data containing comprehensive information on individuals' employment status and earnings. The effects of our treatment tend to be positive, but concentrated among job seekers who are at risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time. Specifically, treatment effects in our overall sample are moderately positive on average, but mostly insignificant. At the same time, we do observe pronounced and statistically significant effects for individuals who exhibit an increased risk of long-term unemployment. For this group, the brochure increases employment and earnings in the year after the intervention by roughly 4%. Given the low cost of the intervention, our findings indicate that targeted information provision can be a highly effective policy tool in the labor market.

In particular, we study the common practice of using confidence intervals (CIs) based on standard errors that are clustered by the running variable as a means to make inference robust to model misspecification (Lee and Card 2008). We derive theoretical results and present simulation and empirical evidence showing that these CIs do not guard against model misspecification, and that they have poor coverage properties. We therefore recommend against using these CIs in practice. We instead propose two alternative CIs with guaranteed coverage properties under easily interpretable restrictions on the conditional expectation function.","[Kolesar, Michal] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Kolesar, Michal] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Rothe, Christoph] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Mannheim,"Kolesár, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Kolesár, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mkolesar@princeton.edu; rothe@vwl.uni-mannheim.de,,"Kolesar, Michal/0000-0002-2482-7796",National Science Foundation [SES-1628878]; German Scholars Organization; Carl Zeiss Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); German Scholars Organization; Carl Zeiss Foundation,"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Penny Goldberg, Coeditor.

We use a unique data set that comprises tick by tick intervention and order book data, daily capital in- and outflows, and balance sheet information of financial institutions. We apply regression discontinuity methods to identify the surprise component of rule-based interventions and use this variation to measure how they affect exchange rates and capital flows. Our findings indicate that interventions had significant effects on the exchange rate, albeit short-lived (2-3 weeks). Moreover, capital controls amplify the effect of intervention, though some effect remains even in the presence of free capital flows. A methodological contribution of the paper is to extend regression discontinuity designs to a time-series environment and to show how these techniques can be used to identify and estimate local non-linear impulse response functions. A clearly defined policy rule and high frequency data are crucial in exploiting local variation around the policy cutoff. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a human capital economy, however, not only capital but also human capital generates externalities and an additional channel arises that has implications for the overaccumulation (under-accumulation) of capital (human capital). The income sources of the poor and the correlation between wealth and human capital are crucial for the implication of pecuniary externalities. Realistically calibrated models exhibit under-accumulation (overaccumulation) of capital (human capital).","[Park, Yena] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, 280 Hutchison Rd, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Park, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, 280 Hutchison Rd, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",yena.park@rochester.edu,,,,,,,32,6,7,3,25,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

I propose a general equilibrium model in which entrepreneurs finance their firm through a long-term contract with a financial intermediary. The contract is inefficient because firm cash flow is costly to monitor, and borrowers that repudiate cannot be excluded from capital markets. By investing in enforcement capacity, an intermediary can delay debt repayment and maintain incentive compatibility. Reforms that seek to decrease either the cost of monitoring or enforcing contracts, or both, affect firm dynamics and can generate complementaries. Estimating the model with data on Colombian manufacturing firms in the 1980s and 1990s, I find that financial frictions are responsible for a significant aggregate output loss. Most of this distortion can be attributed to private information. Reforms that only reduce private information create significant economic growth and welfare gains, while those that only improve enforcement do not. There are significant complementarities between different types of reforms, as moral hazard is less significant when contracts are more enforceable.

On one hand, migrants' disentitlement to local urban hukou creates financial insecurity through barriers to employment, social welfare, medical insurance, etc., thereby encouraging precautionary saving. On the other hand, it promotes temporary migration, allows divergence in tastes and values from local urban residents to persist, and incentivizes migrant households to save their transitory income. Factors reflecting these two channels, such as medical and pension insurances, the duration of migration, and local home-ownership, are specifically modeled, and they are found to contribute to the discrepancies in consumption between migrant and local urban households, among other factors. In addition, the marginal propensity to consume exhibits heterogeneity across migrant households; it is higher with a longer duration of migration, local homeownership, and self-employment. The lack of these attributes further reinforces the reluctance of migrant households to consume.","[Chen, Xiaofen] Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA",,"Chen, XF (通讯作者)，Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA.",xiaofen@truman.edu,,"Chen, Xiaofen/0000-0001-7220-1993",,,,,30,23,24,9,44,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

I examine a measure of self-reported evaluative wellbeing, the Cantril Ladder, and use data from Gallup to examine wellbeing over the life-cycle. I assess the validity of the measure, and show that it is hard to reconcile with familiar theories of intertemporal choice. I find a worldwide optimism about the future; in spite of repeated evidence to the contrary, people consistently but irrationally predict they will be better off five years from now. The gap between future and current wellbeing diminishes with age, and in rich countries, is negative among the elderly. I also use the measure to think about income transfers by age and sex.

The town of Basalt, in the southwestern part of the state, is split in half by two counties that chose different modes of voting. Our research design compares these two counties to understand whether turnout levels were altered by all-mail elections. Our analysis considers the possibility that social interactions may lead to spillover effects-a situation in which one unit's outcome may be affected by the treatment received by other units. In our application, treated and control voters lived in very close proximity and spillovers are possible. Using the potential outcomes framework, we consider different estimands under the assumption that interference occurs only when treated individuals are in close geographic proximity to a sufficiently high number of control individuals. Under our assumptions, our empirical analysis suggests that all-mail voting decreased turnout in Colorado, and shows no evidence of spatial interference between voters.","[Keele, Luke] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Keele, Luke] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Titiunik, Rocio] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 5700 Haven Hall,505 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Keele, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Keele, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, 304 Old North,37th & O St, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",lk681@georgetown.edu; titiunik@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1357561],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This manuscript was prepared for the CESifo Economic Studies special issue on geocoding to follow our keynote lecture presentation at the 2016 CESifo Economic Studies Conference on the Use of Geo-coded Data in Economic Research, held in Munich in 18 and 19 November 2016.

The first effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be seen as a cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as a trade-cost reducing effect. To test the empirical significance and size of these effects, we exploit differences in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets and a new firm-level dataset on U.K. service firms. We find that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. They also reduce the extent of country-specific off shoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks, and they increase country-specific exports, consistent with a reduction in bilateral communication and trade costs.

This approach has two main advantages. First, it allows us to run multiple long repeated games per session. Second, it allows us to incorporate the strategy method with minimal restrictions on the set of pure strategies that can be implemented. This gives us insight into what happens in long repeated games and into the types of strategies that subjects construct. We report results obtained from the indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma with a continuation probability of delta = .95. We find that during such long repeated prisoner's dilemma games, cooperation drops from the first period of a supergame to the last period of a supergame. When analyzing strategies, we find that subjects rely on strategies similar to those found in the literature on shorter repeated games-specifically Tit-For-Tat, Grim Trigger, and Always Defect. However, we also identify features of strategies that depend on more than just the previous period that are responsible for the drop in cooperation within supergames, but that may be overlooked when using the common strategy frequency estimation approach.

In contrast, we find strong evidence of a firm wage ladder that is highly procyclical. During the Great Recession, this firm wage ladder collapsed, with net worker reallocation to higher wage firms falling to zero.

By analyzing credible plans in a sticky-price economy with occasionally binding zero lower bound constraints, I find that the answer is yes if contractionary shocks hit the economy with sufficient frequency. In the best credible plan, if the central bank reneges on the promise of low policy rates, it will lose reputation and the private sector will not believe such promises in future recessions. Even with a very small probability of future contractionary shocks, the incentive to maintain reputation outweighs the short-run incentive to close consumption and inflation gaps and keeps the central bank on the originally announced path of low nominal interest rates.

Our findings suggest that M&A activity carries significant predictive power over oil return and volatility, while predictability displays remarkably distinct patterns across various quantiles representing normal, bull and bear market states. We also observe that M&A activity by oil firms, i.e. both the acquiring and target firms considered active in the oil and gas (O&G) industry, generally carries greater predictive power over both oil returns and volatility compared to M&A activity by non-oil acquirers, i.e. acquirers that have entered the O&G industry by buying an oil company. Our findings imply that M&A activity in the O&G industry carries valuable fundamental information regarding future expectations on oil price dynamics and should be taken into account in forecasting exercises.

Empirical results indicate that the CUSFTA had a stabilizing effect on the Canadian and U.S. equity markets while increasing the volatility of the CAD/USD exchange rate. NAFTA further reduced the two stock markets' volatility, however unlike CUSFTA, NAFTA also reduced the volatility of the CAD/USD exchange rate. Additional results indicate that during NAFTA, the Mexican stock market is more volatile than the other stock and bilateral exchange markets. Moreover, the exchange rate of the Mexican peso against both the U.S. and Canadian dollars has been more volatile than the Canadian dollar/US dollar exchange rate.

The earnings decline is substantial compared to the out-of-pocket spending increase, and is minimally insured prior to age-eligibility for Social Security Retirement Income.

Therefore, this paper guides us to formulate better economic policies to lower RER variability. Our goal is to test whether the extent and composition of international trade and financial integration would smooth the impact of shocks to the RER for 82 countries from 1974 to 2013. Our findings support existing theoretical models (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995; Hau, 2000). They confirm empirically that the composition of trade and financial openness matters for RER stabilization. We show that trade in manufacturing helps reduce RER volatility while non-manufacturing trade may contribute to higher RER volatility. Financial openness mitigates (amplifies) RER volatility in a country with higher (lower) share of foreign equity vis-a-vis foreign debt liabilities. A greater share of equity in external liabilities can improve the country's resilience to external shocks (Rogoff, 1999). Consequently, policies to lower RER volatility should account for a) the composition of financial openness as measured by the type of capital flows (i.e. equity vs. loan-related) accumulated in the domestic economy and b) the role of the structure of trade (i.e. manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) in the transmission process of shocks to the RER. Our evidence relates to findings of mitigating effects on sudden stops of trade openness (Cavallo and Frankel, 2008), and equity-rather than debt-related financial openness (Levchenko and Mauro, 2007; Calderon and Kubota, 2013).

We use this model to explore the relationship between a household's cereal purchases and its demographic variables. Households eligible to participate in the U.S. Government Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children are found to purchase a larger quantity of cereals when making a purchase and also buy more often. The model is estimated using data from Information Resources Inc.'s National Consumer Panel. These data are heavily censored at zero. The traditional approach for working with such data in demand estimation usually involves accounting for the missing unit value for non-purchase occasions and the evaluation of multivariate probabilities.

Using highly disaggregated firm-level data, we show that the quality upgrading made possible by China's tariff reductions was concentrated in the least productive Chinese exporters. These firms, which had been laggards in terms of quality prior to the tariff reduction, were the most aggressive in increasing the quality of their exports and their inputs and in redirecting their exports toward high income markets where demand for high quality goods is strong. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model featuring scale effect and non-Hicks' neutral productivity that disproportionately affects the efficiency with which firms use intermediate inputs. This latter feature does not appear in workhorse models of firm heterogeneity and endogenous quality choice which provide a distorted view of the impact of trade liberalization on quality upgrading.

One economic theory builds on this relationship and argues that rising inequality leads to greater differential fertility between rich and poor. We show that the relationship between income and fertility has flattened between 1980 and 2010 in the US, a time of increasing inequality, as high income families increased their fertility. These facts challenge the standard theory. We propose that marketization of parental time costs can explain the changing relationship between income and fertility. We show this result both theoretically and quantitatively, after disciplining the model on US data. We explore implications of changing differential fertility for aggregate human capital. Additionally, policies, such as the minimum wage, that affect the cost of marketization, have a negative effect on the fertility and labor supply of high income women. We end by discussing the insights of this theory to the economics of marital sorting.","[Bar, Michael] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Hazan, Moshe] Tel Aviv Univ, CEPR, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Leukhina, Oksana] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Weiss, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zoabi, Hosny] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",California State University System; San Francisco State University; Tel Aviv University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Tel Aviv University; New Economic School,"Hazan, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, CEPR, Tel Aviv, Israel.",mbar@sfsu.edu; moshehaz@post.tau.ac.il; oksana.m.leukhina@gmail.com; davidweiss@post.tau.ac.il; hosny.zoabi@gmail.com,"Hazan, Moshe/S-2470-2019","Hazan, Moshe/0000-0002-5459-5455",Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00466] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),,,48,22,23,5,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Lack of market integration and limited information on non-local products often leave consumers unaware of the prices and quality of non-local firms. They therefore mostly buy locally, limiting firms' potential market size (and competition). We explore this hypothesis using a natural experiment in the Kerala boat-building industry. As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high-quality builders gain market share and grow, while low-quality firms exit. Aggregate quality increases, as does labor specialization, and average production costs decrease. Finally, quality-adjusted consumer prices decline.","[Jensen, Robert] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jensen, Robert; Miller, Nolan H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Miller, Nolan H.] Univ Illinois, Gies Coll Business, 515 E Gregory Dr,MC-520, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Jensen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Jensen, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",robertje@wharton.upenn.edu; nmiller@illinois.edu,,,Harvard Kennedy School,Harvard Kennedy School,"We would like to thank Satish Babu, Peter Cherian, C.M.

However, the economic effects of such policies vary across countries' economic structures; for instance, developing countries face higher fixed trade costs (partly due to higher government border-crossing costs and weaker port infrastructures). We offer three potential contributions. First, we extend a standard Melitz general equilibrium trade model with firm heterogeneity to show how variable-cost and fixed-cost trade elasticities associated with trade liberalizations are heterogeneous and endogenous to levels of country-pairs' bilateral policy and non-policy, variable and fixed trade costs - even allowing for CES preferences and an untruncated Pareto distribution of productivities. Using associated comparative statics, we provide several explicit predictions of the heterogeneous (variable- and fixed-cost) bilateral extensive-margin, intensive-margin, and trade elasticities. Second, we provide empirical support for the theoretical hypotheses. Trade elasticities vary across particular settings. Third, we demonstrate the relevance of these theoretical and empirical results for ex ante trade-flow predictions of potential EIAs. For instance, we show that a 10 percent lower average per capita income of a country-pair is associated with a 60 percent higher partial EIA effect. Moreover, we show empirically that 95-99 percent of the welfare (or probability) estimates of EIA liberalizations between 1,358 North-North, North-South, and South-South country-pairs can be explained by our heterogeneous EIA partial treatment effects.","[Baier, Scott L.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Econ, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Clance, Matthew W.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa",Clemson University; University of Notre Dame; Ifo Institut; University of Pretoria,"Bergstrand, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Dept Finance, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",sbaier@clemson.edu; bergstrand.1@nd.edu; matthew.clance@up.ac.za,"Clance, Matthew/R-1518-2018","Clance, Matthew/0000-0002-9280-7324",Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; University of Pretoria's Research Development Program,Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; University of Pretoria's Research Development Program,"We thank the editor, Nathan Nunn, three anonymous referees, Costas Arkolakis, Antoine Gervais, Marc Melitz, Stephen Redding and seminar and conference participants at Arizona State University, Southern Methodist University, University of Nottingham, the International Economics and Finance Society, and the Latin American and Caribbean Economics Association for excellent comments on earlier drafts.

We then solve for revenue maximizing collusion-proof auctions.

This premise, however, does not seem validated as there is no consensus in the empirical literature regarding the impact of exchange rate changes on trade flows. We reexamine whether currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using a rich and unique Chinese customs dataset spanning the universe of bilateral Chinese transaction level trades over the 2000 to 2011 period. This dataset allows us to consider firm-level involvement in processing trade and firm-level dynamics in both export and import markets. Key findings of our firm-level estimations of trade elasticities include that the response of Chinese firms to exchanges rate changes depends strongly on the extent to which firms are involved in processing trade, i.e. heterogeneity in the extent of processing trade is crucial to understanding trade elasticities, and that the Chinese trade balance responds strongly to changes in the relative value of the Chinese Yuan, thereby implying that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is significant and that currency depreciations do in fact lead to export growth and trade balance improvement.

More specifically we argue that Americans' preferences for music will reflect dimensions of these political and economic divides. To test this proposition, our research examines the geographic variation of five key categories of music preferences across 95 of the largest US metropolitan areas. We use factor analysis to identify and map geographic variation of musical preferences, and we use both bivariate correlation analyses and regression analysis to examine the associations between metro-level musical preferences and key economic, demographic, political, and psychological variables.

The second group of papers consists of studies applying the techniques at hand to industrial organization (Reynolds and Rietzke in Econ Theory 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-016-0963-6; Cosandier et al. in Econ Theory, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-017-1050-3) and applied microeconomic theory (Dekel and Pauzner in Econ Theory, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-017-1083-7). Finally, the paper by Bich et al. (Econ Theory, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-017-1045-0) considers an alternative general formulation of a theoretical framework for dynamic programming.","[Amir, Rabah] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Amir, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",rabah-amir@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We use a quasiexperimental design to assess whether requiring undergraduate students in an introductory course to review prior to lecture the material that will be taught in class enhances their understanding of key concepts. We find that requiring rather than recommending preparation before class increases exam scores by about a quarter of a standard deviation, or roughly a third of a letter grade, for students in the second and third quartiles of the ability distribution but has little impact on very high- or low-ability students. We also estimate local average treatment effects, from which we draw a similar conclusion: reviewing the material before lecture benefits students in the middle of the ability distribution but has essentially no impact on the top and bottom quartiles.","[Andersen, Martin S.; Gicheva, Dora; Sarbaum, Jeffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, POB 26170, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Andersen, MS (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, POB 26170, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.",msander4@uncg.edu; d_gichev@uncg.edu; jksarbau@uncg.edu,"Andersen, Martin/J-7018-2019","Andersen, Martin/0000-0001-5982-2541",,,,,24,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Horse breeders possess superior information about their own horses and have strong financial incentives to buy the best of these back at auction. However, those they repurchase subsequently perform significantly worse on average, earning 30% less at the racetrack than horses purchased by outsiders. Moreover, this underperformance is concentrated in male horses, despite these being purchased exclusively for racing purposes. These puzzling findings cannot be explained by differences in horse risk or breeder abilities, or by nonfinancial objectives, or by behavioral or selection biases.","[Boyle, Glenn] Sapere Res Grp, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Boyle, Glenn] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Ward, Gerald] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Canterbury; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Boyle, G (通讯作者)，Sapere Res Grp, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.;Boyle, G (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",glenn.boyle@canterbury.ac.nz; geraldward@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,University of Canterbury School of Business and Economics,University of Canterbury School of Business and Economics,"We are grateful for the assistance of many people.

We examine the impact of competition from these surgical centres on the efficiency - measured by pre-surgery length of stay for hip and knee replacement patients - and case mix of incumbent public hospitals. We exploit the fact that the government chose the broad locations where these surgical centres (Independent Sector Treatment Centres or ISTCs) would be built based on local patient waiting times - not length of stay or clinical quality - to construct treatment and control groups that are comparable with respect to key outcome variables of interest. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that the government-facilitated entry of surgical centres led to shorter pre-surgery length of stay at nearby public hospitals. However, these new entrants took on healthier patients and left incumbent hospitals treating patients who were sicker. This paper highlights a potential trade-off that policymakers face when they promote competition from private, for-profit firms in markets for the provision of public services. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In contrast to most Europeans, who get universal health insurance from the government, most working-age Americans get health insurance through their employers. We find that the employment-based health insurance system provides Americans with an extra incentive to work and work full-time. In a calibrated version of the model, we assess the extent to which the different health insurance systems account for the differences in employment rate and full-time/part-time shares of workers between the U.S. and European countries. Our quantitative results suggest that the different health insurance systems can account for a significant fraction of the differences in employment rate and full-time/part-time shares of workers between the two regions. In addition, we find that the employment-based health insurance system is one of the reasons why many Americans work more than Europeans. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Informational frictions limit the amount of external funds that banks can raise. In this framework, I consider two types of financial intermediation: traditional banking and shadow banking. By pooling different loans, shadow banks achieve a higher endogenous leverage compared to traditional banks, increasing credit availability. However, shadow banks also make the financial sector more fragile because of the lower quality of the loans they finance and because of their exposure to bank runs. In this setting, unconventional monetary policy can reduce macroeconomic instability.","[Ferrante, Francesco] Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Ferrante, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",francesco.ferrante@frb.gov,,,,,,,65,17,22,4,34,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Our results demonstrate that the welfare consequences of a given policy vary substantially across these two groups. For agents born into the future steady state, the expected non-environmental welfare costs are minimized when carbon tax revenue is used to reduce an existing distortionary tax. In contrast, among the agents alive when the policy is adopted, recycling revenue through uniform, lump-sum rebates results in the largest welfare increase across the policies we examine. Moreover, we find that the regressivity or progressivity of a policy also differs within the living population versus the future steady state population. Overall, our results illustrate that estimates of the non-environmental welfare costs of carbon tax policies that are based on the long-run outcomes miss-represent the near-term consequences. Given the potential importance of these near-term effects on the political feasibility of a policy, our findings indicate that, when designing a carbon tax, policy makers must pay careful attention to not only the long-run outcomes, but also to the transitional welfare effects of the policy.

The study finds significant variation in the time and cost to obtain an electricity connection across countries. In low-income countries, for instance, the cost of an electricity connection is 70 times higher than in high income countries. The study finds that income levels and a newly constructed Getting Electricity index that combines data for the three measures (procedures, cost and time) are strongly correlated and that the new index cannot predict electrification rates and losses in the electricity system once differences in income level are considered. However, the new index presented has explanatory power for economic losses that firms report due to the poor quality of electricity supply and the likelihood of bribe payments asked from firms by electric utilities. The paper also finds that procedures for connection processes tend to be more cumbersome in countries where other regulatory processes are also complex, suggesting a persistence of bureaucracy across public sector entities in countries. Finally, the study finds that simpler and less costly electricity connection processes are associated with better firm performance in industries with high electricity needs, such as manufacturing motor vehicles.

Their Phillips curve was vertical in the long run at the natural unemployment rate, and their short-run curve shifted up whenever unemployment was pushed below the natural rate. This paper criticizes the underlying assumption of the Friedman-Phelps approach that the labor market continuously clears and that changes in unemployment down or up occur only in response to 'fooling' of workers, firms, or both. A preferable and resolutely Keynesian approach explains quantity rationing by inertia in price and wage setting. The positive correlation of inflation and unemployment in the 1970s and again in the 1990s is explained by joining the negatively sloped Phillips curve with a positively sloped dynamic demand curve. For any given growth of nominal GDP, higher inflation implies slower real GDP growth and higher unemployment. This 'triangle' model based on demand, supply, and inertia worked well to explain why inflation and unemployment were both positively and negatively correlated between the 1960s and 1990s, but in the past decade the slope of the short-run Phillips curve has flattened as inflation exhibited a muted response to high unemployment in 2009-2013 and low unemployment in 2016-2018.","[Gordon, Robert J.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Gordon, Robert J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gordon, RJ (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Gordon, RJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Smith-Richardson Foundation,Smith-Richardson Foundation,This research has been supported by the Smith-Richardson Foundation.

Decades after the SDY program ended, increased access to migration in cities that sent SDY leads to higher rates of migration from provinces where those SDY temporarily resided. We find that improved access to migration leads to lower consumption volatility and lower asset holding. Furthermore, household production shifts into high-risk, high-return activities.","[Kinnan, Cynthia] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wang, Shing-Yi] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 1456 Steinberg Hall,Dietrich Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Yongxiang] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Finance & Business Econ Dept, Los Angeles, CA USA",Tufts University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Southern California,"Kinnan, C (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",cynthia.kinnan@tufts.edu; was@wharton.upenn.edu; yongxiaw@marshall.usc.odu,"Wang, Yongxiang/HGB-4562-2022",,China National Science Foundation [71472180]; Australian Research Council [DP150102339],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"A previous version of this paper was circulated as Relaxing Migration Constraints for Rural Households.

Energy-economic planning models are often used to develop future projections of these technologies, and although it is well-understood that model outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about technology developments and market conditions, it is less clear how underlying model structures might impact outcomes. For wind and solar technologies, model structures might be an even larger driver due to the complexity required to represent their variability, uncertainty, and location-dependence. Here, we apply three state-of-the-art electric sector planning models to evaluate variable renewable generation under different conditions with both harmonized and native input assumptions to isolate the impact that model structures might have on deployment outcomes. We find growth in wind and solar deployment in all models under a business-as-usual scenario (without new policies), where the median value for variable renewable energy generation share is found to be 27% by 2050 but with a wide range of estimates (18-43%), types of renewable technologies deployed, and regional distributions across models. With harmonized assumptions about technology costs and market conditions the range narrows slightly, but a large range in penetration outcomes remains (24-41% by 2050) suggesting that model representations play significant roles in projections of future wind and solar deployment. We also assess the implications of achieving 55% wind and solar penetration by 2050-to assess potential challenges at higher penetration levels and the magnitude of variable generation under a carbon-constrained future. Finally, we identify research needs to better assess the future deployment of variable renewable energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Capital flows reduce inefficient output fluctuations in this region by inducing exchange rate movements that reallocate expenditure towards the goods it produces. Restricting capital mobility hampers such an adjustment. From a global perspective, constrained efficiency entails subsidizing capital flows to address an aggregate demand externality associated with exchange rate movements. Absent cooperation, however, dynamic terms-of-trade manipulation motives drive countries to inefficiently restrict capital flows, impeding aggregate demand stabilization. (C)2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model sheds light on the ambiguous empirical results reported in the literature regarding the growth effects of the policy of devolving fiscal responsibility to local governments. We find that the distribution of civicness within a country determines the magnitude of the effects of decentralization on its regional convergence, as well as whether decentralization fosters or dampens the country's national growth. We perform a series of simulated reforms using Monte Carlo methods parameterized using OECD countries data set. We then test our findings using a panel data set of 23 OECD countries covering the period 1975-2010. We find that the short and the long run growth effect of decentralization policy depends on the size of the policy reform and can range from extremely negative to positive depending on the rule of law, the level of social capital and its regional dispersion, in line with the model predictions.

Intuitively, in these equilibria, players exchange favors by taking individually suboptimal actions if these actions create a gain for the opponent larger than the player's loss from taking them. In exchange, the player who provides a favor implicitly obtains from the opponent a chip that entitles the player to receiving a favor at some future date. Players are initially endowed with a number of chips, and a player who runs out of chips is no longer entitled to receive any favors until she provides a favor to the opponent, in which case she receives one chip back. We show that such simple chip strategies approximate efficient outcomes in a class of repeated symmetric games with incomplete information, in which each player has two possible types, when discounting vanishes. This class includes many important applications, studied in numerous previous papers, such as the favor-exchange model of Mobius (), repeated auctions, and the repeated version of Spulber duopolies of Athey and Bagwell (), among others. We also show the limitation of chip strategies. For example, if players have more than two types, then such simple chip strategies may not approximate efficient outcomes even in symmetric games.","[Olszewski, Wojciech] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Safronov, Mikhail] Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge, England",Northwestern University; University of Cambridge,"Olszewski, W (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",wo@northwestern.edu; mikhailsafronov2014@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,28,3,6,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We study how aggregate shocks transmit to recruiting intensity, and whether this channel can account for the dynamics of aggregate matching efficiency during the Great Recession. Productivity and financial shocks lead to sizable procyclical fluctuations in matching efficiency through recruiting effort.

Wealth holdings are small in childhood but they have strong predictive power for future wealth in adulthood. At age 18, asset holdings of children are more informative than parental wealth in predicting wealth of children when they are in their 40s. We investigate why and rule out that childhood wealth in itself can accumulate enough to explain later wealth inequality.

This has been attributed to macroeconomic policy, social spending, and increased returns to education. This paper explores this issue from a gender perspective by econometrically evaluating how changes in economic structure and policy have impacted gendered employment and unemployment rates, as well as gender inequality in these variables, using country-level panel data for a set of 18 Latin American countries between 1990 and 2010. Three variables stand out as having consistent gender-equalizing effects in the labor market: social spending, minimum wages, and public investment. Less important or consistent were the effects of external factors (such as terms of trade), economic structure, and GDP growth.","[Braunstein, Elissa] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Seguino, Stephanie] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT USA",Colorado State University; University of Vermont,"Braunstein, E (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,,,International Labour Organization,International Labour Organization,"We are grateful for helpful comments from Sarah Gammage, an anonymous referee, and the editors of Review of Keynesian Economics, and for financial support from the International Labour Organization.",,37,16,25,4,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We use population censuses and largescale household surveys to compile detailed data on the ethnolinguistic composition of each region and match all reported ethnicities to Ethnologue, a comprehensive catalog of world languages. This matching allows us to standardize the notion of an ethnolinguistic group and account for relatedness between language pairs, a correlate of shared history and culture, when calculating diversity indices. Exploiting within-country variation provided by our new dataset, we find that local public goods provision, as reflected in metrics of education, health, and electricity access, is negatively related to ethnolinguistic diversity, but only if the underlying basic languages are first aggregated into larger families or if linguistic distances between groups are taken into consideration. In other words, only deep-rooted diversity, based on cleavages formed in the distant past, is strongly inversely associated with a range of regional development indicators. Furthermore, we show that subnational diversity has been remarkably persistent over the past two-three decades implying that population sorting in the short to medium run is unlikely to bias our main findings.","[Gershman, Boris; Rivera, Diego] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Gershman, B (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",boris.gershman@american.edu,,"Gershman, Boris/0000-0002-7688-053X",,,,,59,19,23,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

However, explicit and implicit barriers to movement both within and between countries can hinder migration, potentially affecting welfare improvement. In this article, we use a unique panel dataset of tracked migrants and non-migrants that originate from 18 peasant associations in Ethiopia to examine the welfare impacts of internal migration. Using several techniques, we measure the association of migration with improved welfare among migrants relative non-migrants. We find that migrant welfare improves in a number of different ways; their non-food consumption rises by at least 145%, and we find that migrants also have improved diets relative to non-migrants. Gains are larger among male and urban migrants, as well as migrants who left a longer time in the past. The large welfare contribution of migration, conditional on migrating for employment, suggest that barriers exist, even within countries such as Ethiopia, against the free movement of people to places where they would be objectively better off.","[de Brauw, Alan; Mueller, Valerie] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mueller, Valerie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Woldehanna, Tassew] Addis Ababa Univ, POB 170175, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Addis Ababa University,"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org,,,,,,,33,15,17,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In doing so, growth strategies and change trajectories of countries, regions, and firms are analyzed. The papers use extensive data that enable the models to provide a rich picture of how academic institutions, companies, and regional governments contribute to regional development. As a result, these studies provide new perspectives on regional entrepreneurial transformation. Theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and their application to several contexts provide an advancement of our understanding about Geography and Entrepreneurship. Perspectives on R&D and knowledge, internationalization strategies, high-growth businesses, technological entrepreneurs, university spin-offs, transnational entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial networks are dominant themes included in this special issue.

In addition to offer flexibility benefits, random parameter models allow researchers to make conditional (posterior) inference on preference parameters at the individual-specific level. In this paper we extend the individual-specific experimental approach, that was conducted by Revelt and Train (2000) for the continuous heterogeneity distributions of a mixed logit, to the discrete case of the latent class logit model. Our Monte Carlo study results confirm the expectation that for a given number of individuals, the density of the conditional means converges to the conditional population as the number of choice situations increases. We also add to the analysis the behavior of interval estimates using two methods for the derivation of standard errors of the individual-specific estimates. In general, as we have more information of the choices made by the individuals, we are in better shape to identify individual-specific preferences. Our main conclusion is that accurate individual-specific estimation is possible - including correct assignment to classes, but a large number of choice situations is needed to correctly approximate the true underlying distribution.","[Sarrias, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Cornell University,"Sarrias, M (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile.",mauricio.sarrias@ucn.cl; daziano@cornell.edu,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014; Sarrias, Mauricio/L-7627-2018","Sarrias, Mauricio/0000-0001-5932-4817",National Science Foundation CAREER Award [CBET-1253475]; FONDECYT [11160104],National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER Award CBET-1253475 and FONDECYT Grant 11160104.,,35,20,21,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Ease of identifying who has engaged in theft varies across the two communication treatments, but is of minor importance to the outcome. We find several coding-amenable elements of message content to be statistically significant predictors of group and individual outcomes.

In a month-long experiment with Indian manufacturing workers, we randomize whether coworkers within production units receive the same flat daily wage or differential wages according to their (baseline) productivity ranks. When coworkers' productivity is difficult to observe, pay inequality reduces output by 0.45 standard deviations and attendance by 18 percentage points. It also lowers coworkers' ability to cooperate in their own self-interest. However, when workers can clearly perceive that their higher-paid peers are more productive than themselves, pay disparity has no discernible effect on output, attendance, or group cohesion. These findings help inform our understanding of when pay compression is more likely to arise in the labor market.","[Breza, Emily] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Breza, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Shamdasani, Yogita/GNM-5606-2022","Breza, Emily/0000-0002-4745-4689; Shamdasani, Yogita/0000-0002-9633-9476",JPAL South Asia; National Science Foundation; IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; AEA RCT Registry [0000569],JPAL South Asia; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; AEA RCT Registry,"We gratefully acknowledge operational support from JPAL South Asia and financial support from the National Science Foundation, the IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program, and the Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative.

While regular calibration can be guaranteed only by randomized forecasting procedures, we show that smooth calibration can be guaranteed by deterministic procedures. As a consequence, it does not matter if the forecasts are leaked, i.e., made known in advance: smooth calibration can nevertheless be guaranteed (while regular calibration cannot). Moreover, our procedure has finite recall, is stationary, and all forecasts lie on a finite grid. To construct the procedure, we deal also with the related setups of online linear regression and weak calibration. Finally, we show that smooth calibration yields uncoupled finite-memory dynamics in n-person games-smooth calibrated learning in which the players play approximate Nash equilibria in almost all periods (by contrast, calibrated learning, which uses regular calibration, yields only that the time averages of play are approximate correlated equilibria).

We extend existing NGO models by distinguishing between local workers and expatriates. The model covers both NGO monopoly and competition in the market for donations. Assuming that NGOs maximize output, we show that regulations in the form of a quota on the number of expatriates or a work permit fee for foreigners reduces NGO output, but increases employment of locals. The optimal quota is more likely to bind in the market structure generating the highest total fundraising surplus. An optimal work permit fee is equivalent to an optimal quota in both the monopoly and duopoly cases. For both instruments, the optimal tightness of regulation is decreasing in the weight the government attaches to the public good relative to domestic incomes and in the importance of NGO output to the supply of the public good. Aggregate NGO output and the level of the public good produced could be higher with a monopoly NGO.","[Glazer, Amihai] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Hagen, Rune Jansen] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Rattso, Jorn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Bergen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Rattso, J (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Dragvoll Campus, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",jorn.rattso@svt.ntnu.no,"Hagen, Rune Jansen/I-8522-2019",,,,,,23,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives. We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a meta-analysis of similar treatments in the literature.

Simultaneous equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous equations models are not point identified. Important features of these models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the coefficients' marginal distributions conditional on exogenous covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are necessary for point identification. The second requires full support instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient conditions for point identification of the distributions of these endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments. I apply my results to the Add Health data to analyse peer effects in education.","[Masten, Matthew A.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Masten, MA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,University Research Grants Committee at Northwestern University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01 HD040428-02]; National Science Foundation [REC-0126167]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Child Development [5 R24 HD042849],University Research Grants Committee at Northwestern University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Child Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This is a revised version of my November 3, 2012 job market paper (chapter 1 of my Northwestern University Ph.D. dissertation, Masten, 2013b).

The agent uses a Bayesian learning algorithm with a bias towards recent observations to assign probability to each process. While the true process is stationary, the consumer's beliefs change as he misinterprets a drift in dividends from their steady state value as an increased likelihood that the dividend process is non-stationary. Belief changes result in large swings in asset prices which are subsequently reversed. The model then is consistent with a broad array of asset pricing puzzles. It predicts the negative correlation between current returns and future returns and the PE ratio and future returns. Consistent with the data, I also find that consumption growth negatively correlates with future returns and the PE ratio and consumption growth forecast future consumption growth. The model amplifies return volatility over the benchmark rational expectations case and exactly matches the standard deviation of consumption. Finally, the model generates time varying volatility consistent with the data on quarterly equity returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It then introduces an ethnography of the GD implementation by a Japanese multinational firm (2013-2017). It analyzes the firm's pedagogical effort to correct the unconscious cultural bias to retool the existing habitus of managers and employees. The firm's cultural strategies parallel its human resources (HR) reforms in its attempt to change organizational norms regarding how corporate men and women should work. Deploying theoretical perspectives of cultural neuroscience, semiotics, learning theory and interpretive anthropology, the author then identifies seven strategic foci for this firm's cultural transformation, and terms this habitus-shifting program as MRS-PARC: M=magical messages and messengers; R=rites of passage and rituals; S=signs and symbols; P=rewarding and punishing task performances; A=clarifying alternatives and affordance; R=dealing with unexpected results, resistance and rear guards; and C=communication, complexity and continuity. Once MRS-PARC starts, corporate social drama and critical incidents lead the observer to the nexus of symbolic resistance and representation that in turn helps clarify how to modify the existing accommodation-and-redress mechanism for reform. MRS-PARC offers an empirically derived, action-oriented, process-based, analysis for those interested in moderating the people's referential frameworks and cognitive/emotional orientations for organizational transformation.","[Hamada, Tomoko] Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Hamada, T (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",thamad@wm.edu,,,,,,,21,4,4,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In a theoretical model, we demonstrate that, in the presence of regime-dependent macro feedback relations, a highly leveraged banking system can result in instabilities and downward spirals. To investigate this question empirically, we analyze time series from eight advanced economies on industrial production and the components of the country-specific financial stress indices constructed by the IMF. Employing nonlinear, multiregime vector autoregressions, we examine how industrial production is affected by the individual risk drivers making up the indices. Our results strongly suggest that financial-sector stress has a substantial, nonlinear influence on economic activity and that individual risk drivers affect output rather differently across stress regimes and across groups of countries.","[Mittnik, Stefan] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Semmler, Willi] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Munich; The New School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Bielefeld; European Central Bank,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Mittnik, Stefan/0009-0006-9558-2729; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW),Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW),"A previous version, entitled Estimating a Banking-Macro Model for Europe Using a Multi-regime VAR, was presented at a conference on The Future of the Euro and Europe, Sapienza University, Rome, July 2013, organized by Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, at the 7th International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics, University of London, December 2013, and at the conference of the Society of Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, New York, April 2014.

Focusing on emerging markets, we ask whether this conventional wisdom still holds in our contemporary world. Our results show that, despite recent structural and regulatory changes, much of it survives. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are more stable than non-FDI inflows. Within non-FDI inflows, portfolio debt and bank-intermediated flows remain the most volatile. Whereas FDI inflows are driven mainly by pull factors, portfolio debt and equity are driven mainly by push factors; bank-intermediated flows are driven a combination of push and pull factors. Capital outflows from emerging markets behave differently, however. FDI outflows from emerging markets have grown and become significantly more volatile. There is similarly an increase in the volatility of bank-intermediated capital outflows from emerging markets. Our findings underscore that outflows from emerging markets, both FDI and bank-related flows, have come to play a growing role and warrant greater attention from analysts and policymakers.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Poonam; Masetti, Oliver] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; The World Bank,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eichengr@berkeley.edu; pgupta5@worldbank.org; omasetti@worldbank.org,,,,,,,5,20,21,0,39,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We motivate our analysis using Becker's model of racial bias, which predicts that rates of pretrial misconduct will be identical for marginal white and marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially unbiased. In contrast, marginal white defendants will have higher rates of misconduct than marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially biased, whether that bias is driven by racial animus, inaccurate racial stereotypes, or any other form of bias. To test the model, we use the release tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to identify the relevant race-specific misconduct rates. Estimates from Miami and Philadelphia show that bail judges are racially biased against black defendants, with substantially more racial bias among both inexperienced and part-time judges. We find suggestive evidence that this racial bias is driven by bail judges relying on inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of releasing black defendants.","[Arnold, David] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Arnold, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,48,136,188,5,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

One way to reduce these costs could be to encourage delegation of giving decisions to better-informed others. At the same time, because it involves a loss of agency, delegating these decisions may reduce one's charitable impulse. Unfortunately, the importance of agency in charitable decisions remains largely unexplored. In this paper we shed light on this issue using a laboratory experiment with real donations in which we systematically vary the monetary and agency costs associated with making informed and effective giving decisions,. Our main finding is that agency seems to play a small role in promoting giving. In particular, people do not reduce donations when giving decisions are made by algorithms that guarantee efficient recipients but limit donors' control over giving recipients. Moreover, we find that participating in giving groups - a weaker form of delegated giving -is also effective in that they are appealing to donors who would not otherwise make informed donations, and thus improves overall effective giving. Our results suggest that one path to promoting effective giving may be to create institutions that facilitate delegated generosity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A negative quality of capital shock in the United States generates a global financial crisis.

Heckman-type selection models relax this assumption, but have been criticized because they typically require a selection variable which predicts non-response but not the outcome of interest, and can impose bivariate normality. In this paper we illustrate an application using a copula methodology which does not rely on bivariate normality. We implement this approach in data on HIV testing at a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa which are affected by non-response. Randomized incentives are the ideal selection variable, particularly when implemented ex ante to deal with potential missing data. However, elements of survey design may also provide a credible method of correcting for non-response bias ex post. For example, although not explicitly randomized, allocation of food gift vouchers during our survey was plausibly exogenous and substantially raised participation, as did effective survey interviewers. Based on models with receipt of a voucher and interviewer identity as selection variables, our results imply that 37% of women in the population under study are HIV positive, compared to imputation-based estimates of 28%. For men, confidence intervals are too wide to reject the absence of non-response bias. Consistent results obtained when comparing different selection variables and error structures strengthen these conclusions. Our application illustrates the feasibility of the selection model approach when combined with survey metadata. (C) 2018 The Authors.

A continuum of players arrives continuously over time, and each player chooses once-and-for-all between a safe action (which succeeds with known probability) and a risky action (which succeeds with fixed but unknown probability, depending on the state of the world). The actions also differ in their costs. Before choosing, a player observes the outcomes of K earlier players. There is always an equilibrium in which success is more likely in the good state, and this alignment property holds whenever the initial generation of players is not well informed about the state. In the case of an outcome-improving innovation (where the risky action may yield a higher probability of success), players take the correct action as K -> infinity. In the case of a cost-saving innovation (where the risky action involves saving a cost but accepting a lower probability of success), inefficiency persists as K -> infinity in any aligned equilibrium. Whether inefficiency takes the form of under-adoption or over-adoption also depends on the nature of the innovation. Convergence of the population to equilibrium may be nonmonotone.","[Wolitzky, Alexander] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wolitzky, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",wolitzky@mit.edu,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Department of Economics, MIT, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02142 (email: wolitzky@mit.edu).

Using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), this paper implements six case studies of well-known waves of reforms, those of New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, Ireland and Netherlands in the 1990s, and the labor market reforms in Germany in the early 2000s. In four of the six cases, GDP per capita was higher than in the control group as a result of the reforms. No difference between the treated country and its synthetic counterpart could be found in the cases of Denmark and New Zealand, which in the latter case may have partly reflected the implementation of reforms under particularly weak macroeconomic conditions. Overall, also factoring in the limitations of the SCM in this context, the results are suggestive of a positive but heterogenous effect of reform waves on GDP per capita.","[Adhikari, Bibek] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Duval, Romain; Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Hu, Bingjie] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",Illinois State University; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Adhikari, B (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",badhik1@ilstu.edu; rduval@imf.org; Bhu1@worldbank.org; ploungani@imf.org,,"Adhikari, Bibek/0000-0002-5698-7575",,,,,39,12,15,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Costs of motion are represented by a Riemannian metric, i.e., a state-dependent inner product on the set of population states. The replicator dynamics and the (Euclidean) projection dynamics are the archetypal examples of the class we study. Like these representative dynamics, all Riemannian game dynamics satisfy certain basic desiderata, including positive correlation, local stability of interior ESSs, and global convergence in potential games. When the underlying Riemannian metric satisfies a Hessian integrability condition, the resulting dynamics preserve many further properties of the replicator and projection dynamics. We examine the close connections between Hessian game dynamics and reinforcement learning in normal form games, extending and elucidating a well-known link between the replicator dynamics and exponential reinforcement learning.

In general, governments face trade-offs in choosing between alternative taxes. A source-based cash-flow tax creates welfare-impairing production and consumption distortions, but falls partially on firm owners who may be nonresident. By contrast, a destination-based cash-flow tax does not distort behavior, but falls only on domestic residents.

We estimate a general equilibrium model of costly labour adjustment from data prior to the policy to study the effects of the interventions.

For workers without a college education these figures are 3.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. Why are earnings profiles flatter for recent cohorts? We build a parsimonious model of schooling and human capital accumulation on the job, and calibrate it to earnings statistics of workers from the 1940 cohort. The model accounts for 99% of the flattening of earnings profiles for workers with a college education between the 1940 and the 1980 cohorts (52% for workers without a college education). The flattening in our model results from a single exogenous factor: the increasing price of skills. The higher skill price induces (i) higher college enrollment for recent cohorts and thus a change in the educational composition of workers and (ii) higher human capital at the start of work life for college-educated workers in the recent cohorts, which implies lower earnings growth over the life cycle.

However, with the global urban population currently generating two-thirds of all carbon emissions, global policymakers are urging mayors and regional leaders to make difficult decisions to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization on the environment. The authors begin their examination of the implications of local and regional factors by applying the Dynamic Spatial Durbin Panel Data Model to empirically examine aspects of developing low-carbon strategies for the rapidly expanding size and number of the world's urban areas. The results indicate that the contribution of urbanization to carbon emissions can be positively affected when regional policy makers collaborate to focus on spillover effects to simultaneously manage the scope, diversity, and complexity of economic and environmental issues from the perspective of creating a balance between rapid urbanization and relevant regional factors. Regional leaders can make a difference by creating both short-term goals and long-term strategies for maintaining low-carbon urbanization, nurturing regional coordination, monitoring and managing eco-friendly regional spillover effects, supporting low-carbon technology innovations, and maintaining optimal city size.","[Niu, Honglei] Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lekse, William] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Xuzhou University of Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Niu, HL (通讯作者)，Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",niuhonglei@126.com,,,China's Ministry of Education [17YJCZH132]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education [2015SJD473]; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development [2014-R4-015]; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System [2014ZD45]; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents,"China's Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents","We would like to thank Professor Shang for her valuable and insightful comments on this manuscript.

Comparing these quantities to realized earnings losses for those who separate suggests that the value of nonwork time and other factors (e.g., private and public transfers) offset less than one-third of the earnings losses caused by exiting the military into a weak labor market.","[Borgschulte, Mark] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 West Gregory Dr,214 David Kinley Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Martorell, Paco] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Educ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Borgschulte, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 West Gregory Dr,214 David Kinley Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,"Borgschulte, Mark/0000-0003-1422-8201",,,,,60,11,12,0,4,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

Entry and revenue are much more responsive to tariffs than they are to real exchange rates. Our estimates translate into an elasticity of aggregate exports with respect to tariff changes of between -1.5 and -3.5 on impact, and between -2 and -5 in the long run. Comparable elasticities for real exchange rate changes are around 0.5 on impact, and between 0.6 and 0.8 in the long run. These estimates are consistent with estimates in the literature based on aggregate data. They provide further evidence that workhorse models of international trade and business cycles which impose identical responses must be modified in order to answer policy questions touching on both international trade and the current account.

The reallocation was greater for workers in more internationally integrated provinces and for younger cohorts. We estimate the gap in labor productivity within manufacturing across the informal and formal sectors.

Following up on a conjecture by Smith (1976a), we test whether the well-known equilibrating power of the double auction institution is robust to the presence of complete information about traders' values and costs and the presence of symmetric market power. We find that complete information is insufficient to impede convergence to CE prices; however, introducing market power consistently causes prices to deviate from the CE, whether or not subjects possess complete information. Our design highlights the value of boundary experiments in understanding how market institutions shape behavior, and our findings help delineate the limits of the double auction institution to generate competitive outcomes.

We exploit the identification in international trade data of parent markets (countries) to investigate whether exporting employee spinoffs of exporting parents have an advantage in accessing their parents' markets over exporting comparison firms well positioned to learn those markets at arm's length. We find that, controlling for the greater overlap of spinoffs with their parents' export products, at entry spinoffs access 51 percent more parent markets than exporting firms in the same 4-digit industries and municipalities as the parents. This advantage shrinks monotonically with time, becoming statistically insignificant four years after entry, indicating that intrafirm learning provides spinoffs with a four-year head start over learning at arm's length. Spinoffs do not overlap more than comparison firms with parent markets that the parents did not serve at spinoff entry, providing evidence against the alternative hypothesis that product overlap inadequately controls for greater technological similarity of spinoffs to parents. Firm entry into parent markets predicted by spinoff status does not lead to entry into adjacent markets the following year. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper clarifies a mechanism through which an inefficient financial system can reduce productivity growth. Using a two-sector model, second, we examine the implications for employment and the distribution of income. Both classical and Keynesian versions of the model are considered; saving decisions are central in the classical version while firms' investment and pricing decisions take center stage in the Keynesian version. We find that, although boosting the asymptotic rate of growth, a relaxation of credit constraints may reduce the share of the formal sector, increase inequality and underemployment, and have little or no effect on the medium-run rate of growth.

Increasing expenditures result from increased electricity use for cooling; and are offset to varying degrees, depending on the region, by decreased energy consumption for heating. The analysis is conducted using a model of the global buildings sector within the GCAM integrated assessment model. The integrated assessment framework is valuable because it represents socioeconomic and energy system changes that will be important for understanding building energy expenditures in the future. Results indicate that changes in net expenditures are not uniform across the globe. Net expenditures decrease in some regions, such as Canada and Russia, where heating demands currently dominate, and increase the most in areas with less demand for space heating and greater demand for space cooling. We explain these results in terms of the basic drivers that link building energy expenditures to regional climate.

First, we document that commodity prices exhibit strong comovement with other macro variables along the business cycle of these economies; and that a common factor accounts for most of the time series dynamics of these commodity prices. Guided by these stylized facts, we embed a commodity sector into a dynamic, stochastic, multi-country business cycle model of EMEs where exogenous fluctuations in commodity prices coexist with other driving forces. Commodity prices follow a common dynamic factor structure in the model. When estimated with EMEs data, the model gives to commodity shocks, mostly in the form of perturbations to their common factor, a paramount role when accounting for aggregate dynamics: more than a third of the variance of real output across the EMEs considered is associated to commodity price shocks. The model also performs well when accounting for other business cycle facts. A further amplification mechanism is a spillover effect from commodity prices to interest rates. Yet, sometimes, positive commodity price shocks have also cushioned other negative domestic shocks, particularly during the fast recovery from the world financial crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that in a duopoly model with linear demand and quadratic cost functions, both a partially privatized public firm and a profit-maximizing firm offers flatter supply functions as equilibrium strategies, resulting in a larger social surplus, when the public firm focuses more on social welfare. This implies that the full nationalization is optimal if firms compete in SFE, in contrast to a Cournot case, which has been used as an approximation of the wholesale electricity markets.

When the choice data are binary, a canonical method for making these types of predictions is the logistic choice model. This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve out-of-sample predictions by changing two aspects of the canonical approach: 1) Using response times in addition to the choice data, and 2) Combining them using a model from the psychology and neuroscience literature, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). Two experiments compare the out-of-sample choice prediction accuracies of both methods and in both cases the DDM method outperforms a logistic prediction method. Furthermore, the DDM allows for out-of-sample process predictions. Both experiments validate the DDM as a method for predicting out-of-sample response times. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Corruption in courts affects the incentives to bring forth private antitrust lawsuits. This, in turn, along with corruption in antitrust agency enforcement, alters the incentives to commit antitrust violations. The social welfare effect of enabling private antitrust enforcement in the presence of corruption depends on whether corrupt officials in the ensuing bribery contests favor a particular firm and if so which one and to what extent. Under some circumstances, corruption actually increases the social desirability of private antitrust enforcement relative to the no-corruption scenario. Our analysis highlights that the effects of a given legal arrangement for antitrust enforcement critically depend on the corruption environment and, thus, that the appropriate design of antitrust institutions is context-specific.

In this paper we analyze the problem of parametric inference from combined individual-level data when data combination is based on personal and demographic identifiers such as name, age, or address. Our main question is the identification of the econometric model based on the combined data when the data do not contain exact individual identifiers and no parametric assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of information that is common across the combined data set. We demonstrate the conditions on the observable marginal distributions of data in individual data sets that can and cannot guarantee identification of the parameters of interest. We also note that the data combination procedure is essential in a semiparametric setting such as ours. Provided that the (nonparametric) data combination procedure can only be defined in finite samples, we introduce a new notion of identification based on the concept of limits of statistical experiments. Our results apply to the setting where the individual data used for inferences are sensitive and their combination may lead to a substantial increase in the data sensitivity or lead to a de-anonymization of the previously anonymized information. We demonstrate that the point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of individual disclosure. If the data combination procedure guarantees a bound on the risk of individual disclosure, then the information available from the combined data set allows one to identify the parameter of interest only partially, and the size of the identification region is inversely related to the upper bound guarantee for the disclosure risk. This result is new in the context of data combination as we notice that the quality of links that need to be used in the combined data to assure point identification may be much higher than the average link quality in the entire data set, and thus point inference requires the use of the most sensitive subset of the data. Our results provide important insights into the ongoing discourse on the empirical analysis of merged administrative records as well as discussions on the disclosive nature of policies implemented by the data-driven companies (such as internet services companies and medical companies using individual patient records for policy decisions).","[Komarova, Tatiana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Yakovlev, Evgeny] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Virginia; New Economic School,"Komarova, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.komarova@lse.ac.uk; denis@virginia.edu; eyakovlev@nes.ru,"Yakovlev, Evgeny Y./Q-4931-2017; Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023","Komarova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6581-5097",NSF; STICERD,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); STICERD,"Support from the NSF and STICERD is gratefully acknowledged.

Our empirical findings support the view that the contractionary effect of US monetary normalization on global dollar liquidity would be offset by an expansionary effect from continued supply of US dollar loans by euro area and Japanese banks. The net effect, however, is crucially dependent on the stability of global foreign exchange markets and investor perceptions of the default risks of global banks.

Durables prices are estimated to be as sticky as those of nondurables, leading to a flat relative price response to a monetary policy shock. Conversely, house prices are estimated to be almost flexible. Such results survive several robustness checks and a three-sector extension of the NK model.

A tax on lending can correct the over-lending problem by reducing the returns from lending. Imposition of the tax has a perverse effect on the composition of lending, however, because it falls more heavily on banks that incur expenses to reduce loan losses. Hence, along the external margin, the share of banks that voluntarily monitor loans decreases. In contrast, monetary policy tightening can produce the optimal level of lending without generating any distortion of monitoring incentives.","[Dia, Enzo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantit & Strategie Impr, Milan, Italy; [Van Hoose, David] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",University of Milano-Bicocca; Baylor University,"Dia, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantit & Strategie Impr, Milan, Italy.",,,"Dia, Enzo/0000-0002-4602-4011",,,,,25,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Empirical evidence suggests that income and credit constraints can only account for a part of this under-investment. Recent experimental evidence shows that families' misperceptions about the returns to education play a role in their low-investment levels. This paper builds a heterogeneous-agent model of human capital and growth that incorporates an adaptive learning mechanism to capture the way agents form perceptions about returns to education. We find natural conditions guaranteeing existence of stable equilibria. Along transition paths, agents' misperceptions about returns to education depress realized returns, which serves to reenforce and perpetuate low human-capital investment. If human capital investments have both private and public returns, we find multiple stable equilibria, including those which are characterized by low investment and low returns.","[Emerson, Patrick M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Mcgough, Bruce] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Oregon State University; University of Oregon,"Emerson, PM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",patrick.emerson@oregonstate.edu; bmcgough@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Moreover, choosing a certain level of human capital, agents can differently affect their endogenous earning ability. Finally, agents differ in their human capital disposition: different agents face a different cost to acquire a certain amount of human capital. In this framework we study the problem of assessing tax reforms when a policy maker wants to reduce inequalities due to unequal skills while accepting inequalities due to diverse preferences. Consistent with the findings of the fair income taxation literature, when evaluating a tax reform, in order to obtain a social improvement one should always give priority to agents with the most disadvantaged characteristics who work full time. However, in our framework, this corresponds to a whole range of earnings depending on the corresponding level of human capital. We show how subsidies on human capital affect the level of earnings that gets most priority in order to single out more precisely the population that should be the focus of the reform. Relying on these findings we also study the shape of the optimal tax function.","[Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Valletta, Giacomo] EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59100 Roubaix, France",Princeton University; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Valletta, G (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59100 Roubaix, France.",giacomo.valletta@edhec.edu,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022",,Institute for Global Studies (Paris),Institute for Global Studies (Paris),"We thank the associate editor, two anonymous referees, Francois Maniquet, Paolo Piacquadio, and Emmanuel Saez for comments and suggestions, as well as seminar and conference participants at CORE, Institute for Global Studies, Luiss, the Social Choice and Welfare Meeting 2012 (New Delhi) and the ASSA meeting 2013 (San Diego).

A standard labor supply framework implies a negative effect of the nonpecuniary cost of work on the employee's effort. In contrast, a model of worker morale that is consistent with a widely used theory of Akerlof and Yellen (QJE, 1990) predicts this negative effect is stronger (weaker) for low-morale (high-morale) workers. We exploit a natural experiment design of a firm relocation from Milwaukee's Central Business District to the area's suburban ring in 1992. There is an exogenous source of variation on the adjusted commuting distance among those who stay at the firm. Some workers received a windfall gain, whereas other workers experienced an unforeseen cost in longer commuting time. The estimates suggest that low-morale workers are responsive to the shock in commuting time for some of the dimensions of morale. We conclude that the results give some indication of the model of worker morale.","[Hassink, Wolter H. J.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hassink, Wolter H.

A sufficient condition for the STT is that the ex-ante advantages, the winning probabilities when all the players exert the same amount of effort regardless of their environment, are the same for those two environments. I claim that this sufficient condition for the STT is so weak that players can easily be tempted to choose the second-tier environment, which is the wrong decision. Lab experiments strongly support this claim.","[Kim, Duk Gyoo] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",California Institute of Technology,"Kim, DG (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dgkim@caltech.edu,,"Kim, Duk Gyoo/0000-0002-8906-5630",Cornell Population Center,Cornell Population Center,"I would especially like to thank an anonymous referee, Robert H.

The core idea is that by deliberately inducing demand in a structured way we can bound its influence. We present a model in which participants respond to their beliefs about the researcher's objectives. Bounds are obtained by manipulating those beliefs with demand treatments. We apply the method to 11 classic tasks, and estimate bounds averaging 0.13 standard deviations, suggesting that typical demand effects are probably modest. We also show how to compute demand-robust treatment effects and how to structurally estimate the model.","[de Quidt, Jonathan] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Haushofer, Johannes] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, 427 Peretsman Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Haushofer, Johannes] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 427 Peretsman Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Haushofer, Johannes] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Haushofer, Johannes] Busara Ctr Behav Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Roth, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Keble Coll, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PG, England; [Roth, Christopher] CSAE, Toronto, ON, Canada",Stockholm University; Princeton University; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford,"de Quidt, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",jonathan.dequidt@iics.su.sc; haushofer@princeton.edu; christopher.roth@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Roth, Christopher/ABF-2653-2021",,Handelsbanken's Research Foundations [B2014-0460:1]; Princeton University,Handelsbanken's Research Foundations; Princeton University(Princeton University),"de Quidt: Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm University, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden, and CESifo (email:jonathan.dequidt@iies.su.se); Haushofer: Department of Psychology and Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, 427 Peretsman-Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540, NBER, and Busara Center for Behavioral Economics (email: haushofer@princeton.edu); Roth: Department of Economics, University of Oxford, Keble College, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PG, United Kingdom, and CSAE (email:christopher.roth@economics.ox.ac.uk).This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Stefano DellaVigna, Coeditor.

Firms first choose how much to invest in information acquisition and then engage in dynamic price competition. In equilibrium firms acquire too little information from the perspective of industry profit and the perspective of social welfare. We consider two policies that an industry trade association may institute in light of this: (i) the trade association invests directly to acquire private information for each firm, and (ii) firms individually invest in acquiring private information on their costs, and the trade association collects this information and disseminates it after first period prices have been set. Allowing the trade association to acquire information increases firms' profits and may also increase consumer surplus. Information sharing eliminates firms' signaling incentives, and as a result leads to more information acquisition by the firms and higher consumer surplus as well as higher social welfare. However, information sharing increases firms' profits only when the ex ante uncertainty about cost is large, and it reduces profits otherwise. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data derived from credit reports, we begin by documenting an association between debt characteristics - including credit risk, delinquency and loan balances on student loans, auto loans and credit cards - and subsequent entry into, and durations in parental co-residence. We find relationships consistent with parental co-residence as a smoothing mechanism for young adults facing borrowing constraints. We then formally test the hypothesis that credit accessibility affects co-residence choice by analyzing plausibly exogenous reductions in credit card limits initiated by banks during the Great Recession. We find that young adults who experienced limit reductions were 5% more likely to enter co-residence, and stayed 4% longer in co-residence. The effects of credit limit reductions were larger for young adult borrowers who were closer to their credit limit before the reduction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Examples include law firm associates, surgical residents, and untenured faculty at research-intensive universities. High female exit rates are sometimes blamed on the inability of new mothers to survive the sustained negative productivity shock associated with childbearing and early childrearing in these environments. Gender-neutral family policies have been adopted in some professions in an attempt to level the playing field. The gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies adopted by the majority of research-intensive universities in the United States in recent decades are an excellent example. But to date, there is no empirical evidence showing that these policies help women. Using a unique dataset on the universe of assistant professor hires at top-50 economics departments from 1980-2005, we show that the adoption of gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies substantially reduced female tenure rates while substantially increasing male tenure rates. However, these policies do not reduce the probability that either men or women eventually earn tenure in the profession.","[Antecol, Heather] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Bedard, Kelly] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Stearns, Jenna] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Antecol, H (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",hantecol@cmc.edu; kelly.bedard@ucsb.edu; jestearns@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,28,152,180,7,40,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We find a negative and statistically significant correlation between time perception and time discounting: subjects who overestimate objective time intervals are less willing to delay gratification.

The challenge is to design a replication plan open to both supporting the original findings and uncovering potential problems. The purpose of this paper is to provide replication researchers with an objective list of checks or tests to consider when planning a replication study. The authors present tips for diagnostic replication exercises in four groups: validity of assumptions, data transformations, estimation methods, and heterogeneous impacts. For each group, the authors present an introduction to the issues, a list of replication tests and checks, some examples of how these checks are employed in replication studies of development impact evaluations, and a set of resources that provide statistical and econometric details.

We first estimate a fixed effects model that is identified by analyzing families who move across counties with children of different ages. We then use these fixed effect estimates to (i) quantify how much places matter for intergenerational mobility, (ii) construct forecasts of the causal effect of growing up in each county that can be used to guide families seeking to move to opportunity, and (iii) characterize which types of areas produce better outcomes. For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5%. There is substantial variation in counties' causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families. Boys' outcomes varymore across areas than girls' outcomes, and boys have especially negative outcomes in highly segregated areas. Areas that generate better outcomes have higher house prices on average, but our approach uncovers many opportunity bargains-places that generate good outcomes but are not very expensive.","[Chetty, Raj] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"IRS [TIRNO-12-P-00374]; National Science Foundation; Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","IRS; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","An earlier version of this article was circulated as the second part of the article, The Impacts of Neighborhoods on Intergenerational Mobility: Childhood Exposure Effects and County Level Estimates.

Using monthly data ranging from January 2001 through December 2012. we identify a structural breakpoint in the multivariate time series model of prices of the three staple foods (sorghum, millet, and wheat) and conflict measure (number of conflict events) in September of 2011. Applying structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), we find that wheat price fluctuation is a root cause of conflict events in Sudan.

Francois Bourguignon and Branko Milanovic have written insightful and timely books on global inequality, emphasizing the role of globalization. The books are complementary: Milanovic provides an ambitious broad-brush picture, with some intriguing hypotheses on the processes at work; Bourguignon provides a deep and suitably qualified economic analysis. This paper questions the thesis of both books-that globalization has been a major driving force of inequality between or within countries. The paper also questions the robustness of the evidence for declining global inequality, and notes some conceptual limitations of standard measures in capturing the concerns of many observers in the ongoing debates about globalization and the policy responses.","[Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,75,70,77,4,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

It is argued that the level of intragenerational redistribution in public pension plans is related to a country's cultural background. The level of intragenerational redistribution is measured by Krieger and Traub's Bismarckian factor. The countries' cultural background is operationalized using cultural dimensions developed by Hofstede. The empirical results are in line with our hypotheses. Uncertainty avoidance appears to have a significant, positive association with the Bismarckian factor (low intragenerational redistribution in public pensions), whereas the relation with individualism is negative (high intragenerational redistribution). Moreover, a positive association is found between the Bismarckian factor and inflation shocks in the first half of the 20th century. While the sample size is limited, the results are robust to the inclusion of different economic, institutional, and demographic control variables as well as to using alternative model specifications. These findings have important public policy implications. We argue that pension reform proposals suggesting a transformation of public to private pension provision should consider the cultural background of countries.

We first consider a simple model with utility functions linear in consumption and featuring heterogeneous utility for wealth. In this case, there are no transitional dynamics, the steady-state is reached immediately and has finite elasticities of capital with respect to the net-of-tax rate. This allows for a tractable optimal tax analysis with formulas expressed in terms of empirical elasticities and social preferences that can address many important policy questions. These formulas can easily be taken to the data to simulate optimal taxes, which we do using U.S. tax return data on labor and capital incomes. Second, we show how these results can be extended to the case with concave utility for consumption. The same types of formulas carry over by appropriately defining elasticities. We show that one can recover all the results from the simpler model using a new and non standard steady state approach that respects individual preferences even with a fully general utility function.","[Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stantcheva, Stefanie] Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St,Littauer 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Stantcheva, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St,Littauer 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",saez@econ.berkeley.edu; sstantcheva@fas.harvard.edu,,,MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,"We thank Alan Auerbach, Stephen Coate, Emmanuel Farhi, Mike Golosov, Henrik Eleven, Thomas Piketty, Joel Slemrod, Daniel Waldenstrom, Matthew Weinzierl, Nicolas Werquin, and numerous seminar and conference participants for useful discussions and comments.

Central bank control over the long-run inflation rate depends on whether fiscal policy is Ricardian or Non-Ricardian. The optimal monetary policy follows a generalized Friedman rule that eliminates the liquidity premium on scarce treasury debt.

We investigate whether merely alerting individuals to an upcoming prosocial ask - that is neither avoided nor occurs in an environment with flexibility - results in reduced prosocial behavior. That is, we investigate whether individuals use time to quickly find ways to decline prosocial asks and thus whether surprising individuals with prosocial asks increases compliance.

A long-run player and a market share a common prior about the initial value of a Gaussian hidden state, and learn about its subsequent values by observing a noisy public signal. The long-run player can nevertheless control the evolution of this signal, and thus affect the market's belief. The public signal has an additive structure, and noise is Brownian. I derive conditions for an ordinary differential equation to characterize equilibrium behavior in which the long-run player's actions depend on the history of the game only through the market's correct belief. Using these conditions, I demonstrate the existence of pure-strategy equilibria in Markov strategies for settings in which the long-run player's flow utility is nonlinear. The central finding is a learning-driven ratchet principle affecting incentives. I illustrate the economic implications of this principle in applications to monetary policy, earnings management, and career concerns.","[Cisternas, Gonzalo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Cisternas, G (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gcistern@mit.edu,,,,,,,45,19,26,3,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Gender gaps in workforce participation have a direct negative effect on market, while gender gaps in entrepreneurship affect negatively market output not only by reducing wages and labor force participation but also by reducing the average talent of entrepreneurs and aggregate productivity. We estimate the effects of these gender gaps for 37 European countries, as well as the United States, and find that gender gaps cause an average loss of 17.5% in market output and 13.2% in total output, which also includes household output. Interestingly, the total output loss would be similar (12%) in a model without household sector, since the market output loss is larger when the female labor supply is endogenous. Eastern Europe is the region with the lowest income fall due to gender gaps, while Southern Europe is the region with the largest fall. Northern Europe is the region with the largest productivity fall, which is due to the presence of high gender gaps in entrepreneurship.","[Cuberes, David] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Teignier, Marc] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Teignier, Marc] BEAT, Barcelona, Spain",Clark University; University of Barcelona,"Cuberes, D (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",dcuberes@clarku.edu,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-66701-R]; Generalitat of Catalonia [SGR2014-493],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia,"We would like to thank the editor, Tiago V. de V.

Recent literature on trade with heterogeneous firms has emphasized the third of these effects, while the first two effects are ruled out when using a Pareto distribution for productivity with a support that is unbounded above, and no fixed costs. The goal of this paper is to restore a theoretical role for product variety and pro-competitive gains from trade by using a bounded Pareto distribution for productivity, and to demonstrate their empirical importance. For the U.S. economy over 1992-2005, we find that product variety and the reduction in markups jointly contribute about 75% to the increase in welfare resulting from trade expansion, whereas an upper bound to the selection effect is that it contributes the remaining 25% to the increase in U.S. welfare.

Exploiting heterogeneity in UI generosity across US states and over time, we find that UI helps the unemployed avoid mortgage default. We estimate that UI expansions during the Great Recession prevented more than 1.3 million foreclosures and insulated home values from labor market shocks. The results suggest that policies that make mortgages more affordable can reduce foreclosures even when borrowers are severely underwater. An optimal UI policy during housing downturns would weigh, among other benefits and costs, the deadweight losses avoided from preventing mortgage defaults.","[Hsu, Joanne W.] Fed Reserve Board Governors, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Matsa, David A.; Melzer, Brian T.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Matsa, David A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hsu, JW (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",joanne.w.hsu@frb.gov; dmatsa@kellogg.northwestern.edu; b-melzer@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,"Hsu, Joanne/0000-0002-0715-6230",Northwestern University's Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research,Northwestern University's Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research,"We thank Northwestern University's Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research for financial support and Grant Clayton, Jonathan Cohen, Jesse Davis, Naveen Gohndi, Eric Kennedy, Jake Krimmel, Paolina Medina-Palma, and Kanis Saengchote for research assistance.

The inhibition against collection of expectations data has gradually lessened, generating a substantial body of recent evidence on the expectations of broad populations. This paper first summarizes the history leading to development of the modern literature and overviews its main concerns. I then describe research on three subjects that should be of direct concern to macroeconomists: expectations of equity returns, inflation expectations, and professional macroeconomic forecasters. I also describe work that questions the assumption that persons have well defined probabilistic expectations and communicate them accurately in surveys. Finally, I consider the evolution of thinking about expectations formation in macroeconomic policy analysis. I favorably observe the increasing willingness of theorists to study alternatives to rational expectations assumptions, but I express concern that models of expectations formation will proliferate in the absence of empirical research to discipline thinking. To make progress, I urge measurement and analysis of the revisions to expectations that agents make following occurrence of unanticipated shocks.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Manski, CF (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,173,57,65,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

This paper empirically analyzes the role of culture in determining the labor market engagement of women within the context of collective models of household decision making In particular, we use the epidemiological approach to study the relationship between gender in language and labor market participation among married female immigrants to the U.S. We show that the presence of gender in language can act as a marker for culturally acquired gender roles and that these roles are important determinants of household labor allocations. Female immigrants who speak a language with sex-based grammatical rules exhibit lower labor force participation, hours worked, and weeks worked. Our strategy of isolating one component of culture reveals that roughly two thirds of this relationship can be explained by correlated cultural factors, including the role of bargaining power in the household, and the impact of ethnic enclaves and that at most one third is potentially explained by language having a causal impact.","[Gay, Victor] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 5757S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hicks, Daniel L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Santacreu-Vasut, Estefania] ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Santacreu-Vasut, Estefania] THEMA, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Shoham, Amir] Temple Univ, 1801N Brd St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Shoham, Amir] COMAS, 1801N Brd St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Chicago; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; ESSEC Business School; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Santacreu-Vasut, E (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.;Santacreu-Vasut, E (通讯作者)，THEMA, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",santacreuvasut@essec.edu,"Gay, Victor/AAV-7441-2020","Gay, Victor/0000-0001-9912-3841",,,,,41,26,29,2,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

But after the financial crises and Great Recession, in which roughly eight million homes were foreclosed on and about $7 trillion in home equity was erased, economists and policymakers are re-evaluating the role of homeownership in the American Dream. Many question whether the American Dream should really include homeownership or instead focus more on other aspects of upward mobility, and most acknowledge that homeownership is not for everyone. We take a detailed look at US homeownership from three different perspectives: 1) an international perspective, comparing US homeownership rates with those of other nations; 2) a demographic perspective, examining the correlation between changes in the US homeownership rate between 1985 and 2015 and factors like age, race/ethnicity, education, family status, and income; 3) and, a financial benefits perspective, using national data since 2002 to calculate the internal rate of return to homeownership compared to alternative investments. Our overall conclusion: homeownership is a valuable institution. While two decades of policies in the 1990s and early 2000s may have put too much faith in the benefits of homeownership, the pendulum seems to have swung too far the other way, and many now may have too little faith in homeownership as part of the American Dream.","[Goodman, Laurie S.] Urban Inst, Housing Finance Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Mayer, Christopher] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Real Estate, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mayer, Christopher] Natl Bur Econom Res, Cambridge, MA USA",Urban Institute; Columbia University,"Goodman, LS (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Housing Finance Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",lgoodman@urban.org; cm310@gsb.columbia.edu,,,Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute; Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School,Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute; Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School,"The opinions, analysis, and conclusions of this paper are those of the authors.

Friedman focused on two real measures, the unemployment rate and the real interest rate, but the message was broaderin the longer run, monetary policy controls only the price level. We call this the monetary-policy invariance hypothesis. By 1968, macroeconomics had adopted the basic Phillips curve as the favored model of correlations between inflation and unemployment, and Friedman used the Phillips curve in the exposition of the invariance hypothesis. Friedman's presidential address was commonly interpreted as a recommendation to add a previously omitted variable, the rate of inflation anticipated by the public, to the right-hand side of what then became an augmented Phillips curve. We believe that Friedman's main message, the invariance hypothesis about long-term outcomes, has prevailed over the last half-century based on the broad sweep of evidence from many economies over many years. Subsequent research has not been kind to the Phillips curve, but we will argue that Friedman's exposition of the invariance hypothesis in terms of a 1960s-style Phillips curve is incidental to his main message.","[Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sargent, Thomas J.] NYU, Econ & Business, New York, NY USA; [Sargent, Thomas J.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; New York University,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rehall@stanford.edu; thomas.sargent@nyu.edu,,,,,,,28,20,21,3,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

An ETF is an investment vehicle, with a specific architecture that typically seeks to track the performance of a specific index. The first US-listed ETF, the SPDR, was launched by State Street in January 1993 and seeks to track the S&P 500 index. It is still today the largest ETF by far, with assets of $178 billion. Following the introduction of the SPDR, new ETFs were launched tracking broad domestic and international indices, and more specialized sector, region, or country indexes. In recent years, ETFs have grown substantially in assets, diversity, and market significance, including substantial increases in assets in bond ETFs and so-called smart beta funds that track certain investment strategies often used by actively traded mutual funds and hedge funds. In this paper, we begin by describing the structure and organization of exchange-traded funds, contrasting them with mutual funds, which are close relatives of exchange-traded funds, describing the differences in how ETFs operate and their potential advantages in terms of liquidity, lower expenses, tax efficiency, and transparency. We then turn to concerns over whether the rise in ETFs may raise unexpected risks for investors or greater instability in financial markets. While concerns over financial fragility are worth serious consideration, some of the common concerns are overstated, and for others, a number of rules and practices are already in place that offer a substantial margin of safety.","[Lettau, Martin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Madhavan, Ananth] Black Rock Inc, ETF & Index Investing Res, San Francisco, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",lettau@berkeley.edu; ananth.madhavan@berkeley.edu,"Lettau, Martin/P-4844-2018","Lettau, Martin/0000-0003-4049-4706",,,,,41,57,67,4,151,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our model accounts for several important institutional features of the labor market for lawyers, including differences in the work hours across occupational tracks and learning about the prospects of promotion to partner. Some female students need to take on large amounts of student debt to finance their education and hence start their careers with large amounts of negative wealth. The empirical findings suggest that student debt has negative effects on marriage prospects, career prospects, and investments in educational quality of female lawyers. The analysis also provides new insights into the design of public policies that aim to increase public sector employment.

In our analysis we simulate a competitive benchmark based on estimated marginal costs, startup costs and opportunity costs of thermal and hydro plants. We compare the differences between the self-commitment for the period 2006-2009 and the competitive benchmark to the differences between the bid-based centralized unit commitment and the competitive benchmark after the transition. Based on these comparisons we estimate changes in deadweight losses due to misrepresentation of cost by bidders and dispatch inefficiency. The results suggest that centralized unit commitment has improved economic efficiency, reducing the relative deadweight loss by at least 3.32%. This result could in part be explained by the observation that, before 2009, there was an underproduction of thermal energy relative to the competitive benchmark and it supports the claim that dispatch efficiency has improved after the transition.

In a calibrated non-Ramsey decentralized equilibrium, labor market volatility is inefficient. Keeping fixed the structural parameters, the Ramsey government achieves efficient labor market volatility; doing so requires labor-income tax volatility that is orders of magnitude larger than the tax-smoothing results based on Walrasian labor markets, but a few times smaller than the results based on search and matching markets.

The paper uses a unique Georgian firm-level dataset, in which firm characteristics and output dynamics are matched with their customs export transactions, for the period 2006-2012. We adopt a discrete survival model to explore the role of firm-level characteristics, diversification strategies and network effects on the survival rates of export flows. Low survival rates at the product level limit the ability of Georgian firms to consolidate new products in international markets. The analysis finds that it is production efficiency, rather than size, that boosts export survival chances, that firms' diversification strategies matter for the prospects of survival, and that there is strong evidence of network effects in export survival. We also find that ratified foreign trade agreements contribute to increase the survival of export flows by reducing policy-induced trading costs and increasing information about destination markets.","[Martuscelli, Antonio] Univ Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Varela, Gonzalo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Naples Federico II; The World Bank,"Martuscelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Federico II, Naples, Italy.",antonio.martuscelli@unina.it,,"Varela, Gonzalo/0000-0001-9326-8417",,,,,27,7,9,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

The Knight-Pigou Debate Revisited,ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-THEORY; MARKET PROVISION; CLUB GOODS; TRANSPORTATION; OWNERSHIP; NETWORKS; AIRPORT; ROADS; AREA,"This paper clarifies issues debated by A. C. Pigou and Frank Knight about correcting inefficient use of congestible resources, focusing for concreteness on their original example of road congestion. Instead of government-imposed Pigouvian access fees, Knight favoured access fees set by private toll-setters. We consider the case of n2 congestible roads and an uncongestible road of arbitrary speed. Knight argued that in the case of a single congestible road, a private toll-setter would always choose the toll that Pigou recommended, hence the allocation would minimize aggregate commute time without government meddling. We find instead that two or more toll-setters would never choose Pigouvian tolls except in the special case of a sufficiently fast uncongestible road. Moreover, for uncongestible roads of slower speed, the allocation of motorists under Knight's proposal is almost never efficient. Whenever it is inefficient, motorists are strictly worse off when they pay tolls set by private firms instead of paying government-imposed tolls, and aggregate toll revenue is also lower. Nevertheless, if the private sector does set tolls, then the full cost to motorists can be limited if the government provides an uncongestible alternative, such as a train, to offer potential competition along the same route.","[Salant, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Seegert, Nathan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Salant, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,,47,4,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85,339,,,,,428,448,,10.1111/ecca.12259,0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000434412400002,0

In practice, however, centralized organizations can have its own inefficiencies and decentralized management can do relatively well. Empirically testing relative efficiency is difficult because distinct organizations emerge endogenously in various contexts. This paper, in contrast, draws upon the unique history of New Mexico, leveraging a natural experiment to assess how the partial transition in the early 20th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. My results confirm that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33%. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we track wages for up to 20 years among women and men born in the years 1960-70 who completed a university degree in business or economics. These women and men have similar wages and earnings at the start of their careers, but their career paths diverge substantially as they age. These men and women also have substantial differences in wage paths associated with becoming a parent. We look at whether firm effects account for the differences we observe between women's and men's wage profiles. We document differences between the firms where men work and those where women work. However, a wage decomposition suggests that these differences in firm characteristics play only a small role in explaining the gender log wage gap among these workers. We then examine whether gender differences in firm-to-firm mobility help explain the patterns in wages that we see. Men and women both exhibit greater mobility early in their careers, but there is little gender difference in this firmto-firm mobility. We find that the main driver of the gender difference in log wage profiles is that men experience higher wage gains than women do both as switchers and as stayers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find different responses to fluctuations and long-run growth, both heterogeneous over the life cycle.

Consistent with other developed economies, consumption inequality in Australia is lower on average than income inequality. Both have increased since the early 1990s, with income inequality increasing by more. We decompose the trend in income inequality into four components: (i) changes in observed household characteristics; (ii) changes in the returns to unobserved skills; (iii) changes in the size of persistent income shocks; and (iv) changes in the size of transitory income shocks. We find that changes in the size of persistent and transitory income shocks, rather than changes in observed household characteristics, explain most of this trend. Since the middle of the 2000s, the source of income inequality has shifted from transitory to persistent factors, which is consistent with the rise in consumption inequality over the corresponding period. We find that accounting for imputed rents lowers estimates of the level of inequality in Australia, but has a negligible effect on the trends.","[Kaplan, Greg] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kaplan, Greg] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kaplan, Greg] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [La Cava, Gianni; Stone, Tahlee] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Chicago; University of New South Wales Sydney; National Bureau of Economic Research; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gkaplan@uchicago.edu,"La Cava, Gianni/GXF-5173-2022","La Cava, Gianni/0000-0003-0128-372X",,,,,20,10,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Even in developing countries, households have access to a wide array of new technologies. However, factors affecting households' technology adoption decisions remain poorly understood. Using data on solar microgrid adoption from rural India, we investigate the determinants of household technology adoption. We offer all households identical solar products to avoid bias from product differentiation. Households pay a monthly fee for technology use, allowing us to abstract away from credit constraints as a barrier to adoption. The results show that household expenditures and savings as well as the household head's entrepreneurial attitude are strong predictors of adoption. In contrast, past fuel expenditures, risk acceptance, and community trust are not associated with technology adoption decisions. These findings suggest new directions for research on the microeconomics of household technology adoption, which is critical for sustainable development among the poor in developing countries.

Two notable examples are the Long-Run Risk and rare disaster frameworks. Such models are difficult to characterize from consumption data alone. Accordingly, concerns have been raised regarding their specification. Acknowledging that both phenomena are naturally subject to ambiguity, we show that an ambiguity-averse agent may behave as if Long-Run Risk and disasters exist even if they do not or exaggerate them if they do. Consequently, prices may be misleading in characterizing these phenomena since they encode a pessimistic perspective of the data-generating process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We generate a panel of attitudes in urban Pakistan, in which respondents are randomly exposed to fact-based statements describing the US in either a positive or negative light. Anti-American sentiment is high and heterogenous in our sample at the baseline, and systematically correlated with intended behavior (such as intended migration to the US). We find that revised attitudes are significantly different from baseline attitudes: attitudes are, on average, revised upward (downward) upon receipt of positive (negative) information, indicating that providing information had a meaningful effect on US favorability. The within-subject design and data on respondents' priors allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We find that revisions are largely a result of salience-based updating. We reject unbiased information-based updating as the only source of revisions. In addition, a substantial proportion of individuals do not respond to the information. This heterogeneity in revision processes means that there is no convergence in attitudes following the provision of information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Visualizations were presented to survey respondents that varied both the number of turbines and their proximity to shore. Results indicate that there is not a scenario for which respondents would be willing to pay more to rent a home with turbines in view, as compared to the baseline view with no turbines in sight. Further, there is a substantial portion of the survey population that would change their vacation destination if wind farms were placed within visual range of the beach. The rental discounts required to attract the segment of the survey population most amenable to viewing wind farms still indicate that rental value losses of up to 10% are possible if a utility-scale wind farm is placed within 8 miles of shore.

We employ household-level data for Spain for years 2000-2015, a period characterized by high economic growth and large immigration that was halted by a long and severe recession. Our estimates reveal that increases in immigrant density at the school level triggered an important native flight from tuition-free, public schools toward private ones. We also find strong evidence of cream-skimming as more educated native households are the most likely to switch to private schools in response to immigration. Furthermore, we find that immigration leads to higher student teacher ratios in public schools.

In this paper, we provide clean evidence that previous transactions play an important role in shaping perceptions of fairness. Buyers used to high market prices, for example, are more likely to perceive high prices as fair than buyers used to low market prices. Similarly, employees used to high wages are more likely to perceive low wages as unfair. Our data further allows us to decompose this history-dependence into the effects of pure observation versus the experience of payoff-relevant outcomes. We propose two classes of models of path-dependent fairness preferences-either based on endogenous fairness reference points or based on shifts in salience-that can account for our data. Structural estimates of both types of models imply a substantial deviation from existing history-independent models of fairness. Our results have implications for price discrimination, labor markets, and dynamic pricing.","[Herz, Holger] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Taubinsky, Dmitry] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of Fribourg; Dartmouth College,"Herz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.",holger.herz@unifr.ch; dtaubinsky@gmail.com,,"Herz, Holger/0000-0003-3495-1640",Center for Foundations of Economic Preferences at the University of Zurich; Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation; Harvard Business School doctoral program; ERC grant on the Foundations of Economic Preferences,Center for Foundations of Economic Preferences at the University of Zurich; Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation; Harvard Business School doctoral program; ERC grant on the Foundations of Economic Preferences(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Philippe Aghion, Bjoern Bartling, Tom Cunningham, Stefano DellaVigna, Ernst Fehr, Oliver Hart, Michael Kosfeld, David Laibson, Michael Luca, Alex Peysakhovich, Al Roth, Klaus Schmidt, Florian Zimmermann, as well as seminar participants at Berkeley, Frankfurt, Fribourg, Harvard, Mainz, Vienna and Zurich, as well as participants at IMEBE 2013, THEEM 2013, the ESA World meeting 2013, the ESEM World meeting 2015, as well as at the V IIBEO workshop for helpful comments and discussions.

In this paper, we assert that travel demand modeling should be one of the many fields that focuses on the production of valid causal inferences, and we hypothesize about reasons for the current disconnect between the two bodies of research. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of uniting these two disciplines. We consider what travel demand modeling can gain from greater incorporation of techniques and perspectives from the causal inference literatures, and we briefly discuss what the causal inference literature might gain from the work of travel demand modelers. In this paper, we do not attempt to solve issues related to the drawing of causal inferences from travel demand models. Instead, we hope to spark a larger discussion both within and between the travel demand modeling and causal inference literatures. In particular, we hope to incite discussion about the necessity of drawing causal inferences in travel demand applications and the methods by which one might credibly do so.","[Brathwaite, Timothy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Brathwaite, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",timothyb0912@berkeley.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,90,7,10,4,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

We find that Moore-Repullo mechanisms fail to implement truth-telling in a substantial number of cases even under perfect information about the valuation of the good. Our data further suggests that a substantial proportion of these lies are made by subjects who hold pessimistic beliefs about the rationality of their trading partners. Although the mechanism should-in theory-provide incentives for truth-telling, many buyers in fact believe that they can increase their expected monetary payoff by lying. The deviations from truth-telling become significantly more frequent and more persistent when agents face small amounts of uncertainty regarding the good's value. Our results thus suggest that both beliefs about irrational play and small amounts of uncertainty about valuations may constitute important reasons for the absence of Moore-Repullo mechanisms in practice.

An intuition for herding is that this coarseness of the action space relative to the space of potential beliefs is responsible for herding, and were the action space sufficiently rich, learning would be complete. That intuition is false: simple examples illustrate that learning may be incomplete even if the action space is isomorphic to the space of beliefs. What then distinguishes models with coarse versus rich action spaces? This paper develops the language of responsiveness to formalize this distinction. Responsiveness assesses the sensitivity of optimal actions with respect to their rationalizing beliefs. If the optimal action always changes with beliefs, then complete learning is guaranteed regardless of the information structure. By contrast, if the action that is optimal at certainty remains optimal near-certainty, then complete learning is guaranteed if and only if information can induce unbounded likelihood ratios. The lens of responsiveness unifies results across coarse and rich action spaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ali, S.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining governments effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","[Arora, Puneet; Chong, Alberto] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Chong, Alberto] Univ Pacifico, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Chong, Alberto] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Chong, A (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Chong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.;Chong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru.",achong6@gsu.edu,"Arora, Puneet/GZN-1044-2022","Arora, Puneet/0000-0001-5899-1386",,,,,33,15,16,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Yet, serious weaknesses in these statistics persist. The extent of bias in smallholder labor data is examined by conducting a randomized survey experiment among farming households in rural Tanzania. Agricultural labor estimates obtained through weekly surveys are compared with the results of reporting in a single end-of-season recall survey. The findings show strong evidence of recall bias: people in traditional recall-style modules reported working up to four times as many hours per person-plot as those reporting labor on a weekly basis. Recall bias manifests both in the intensive and extensive margins of labor reporting: while hours are over-reported in recall, the number of people and plots active in agricultural work are under-reported. The evidence suggests that this recall bias is driven not only by failures in memory, but also by the mental burdens of reporting on highly variable agricultural work patterns to provide a typical estimate. All things equal, studies suffering from this bias would understate agricultural labor productivity.","[Arthi, Vellore] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Beegle, Kathleen; Palacios-Lopez, Amparo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",University of Essex; The World Bank; University of Antwerp; KU Leuven,"Beegle, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",kbeegle@worldbank.org,,"De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",IZA/DFID Growth and Labour Markets in Low Income Countries Program (GLM-LIC) [GA-C3-RA1-360]; World Bank Research Committee,IZA/DFID Growth and Labour Markets in Low Income Countries Program (GLM-LIC); World Bank Research Committee,"This study is an output of the Minding the (Data) Gap: Improving Measurements of Agricultural Productivity through Methodological Validation and Research project led by the Living Standards Measurement Study team of the World Bank and funded by the U.K. Department for International Development.

A fiscal distress episode is identified as a period when government experiences extreme funding difficulties. Most EWSs employ a specific set of only fiscal leading indicators predetermined by the researchers, which casts doubt on their robustness. We revisit this issue using extreme bounds analysis, which allows identifying robust leading indicators of fiscal distress from a large set. A robust leading indicator's effect does not strongly depend on the model specification. Consistent with the theoretical predictions of latest generation crisis models, we find that both fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators are robust. In addition, we find that a fiscal vulnerability indicator based on fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators offers a 29% gain in predictive power compared to a traditional one based only on fiscal leading indicators. This suggests that both fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators should be taken into account when assessing country's vulnerability to fiscal distress.","[Bruns, Martin] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Poghosyan, Tigran] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; International Monetary Fund,"Bruns, M (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany.",mbruns@diw.de,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To investigate the mechanism, this paper has employed Ho & Zhu (2004) two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to decompose banks' efficiency into operational efficiency (ability to expand their business with given inputs), and market efficiency (ability to make maximum profits with given business scale), and test the impacts of foreign capital participation on sixteen Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency. The Tobit regression method has been employed since the market efficiency measured with the two-stage DEA approach is always positive and hence not random. The findings indicate that the foreign capital participation has significant and positive impact on the Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency even as a minority shareholder, while the weight of the foreign ownership is not so important. Besides, the banks are all significantly influenced by macroeconomic fluctuations. These findings are important for both China and the other transitional economies and developing economies to improve the policies of financial liberalisation.","[Xu, Tao] Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Tao] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA",Soochow University - China; University of Notre Dame,"Xu, T (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Xu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA.",tylersu@sina.com,,,Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790071]; Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program,"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program",The author is grateful for the sponsorship of the Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of China (Fund No.: 15YJA790071) and the Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program.,,35,1,1,3,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We show that if firm risk is ambiguous, while stocks always induce the agent to perceive a high risk, options can induce him to perceive a low risk. As a result, options can be less costly in incentivizing the agent than stocks in the presence of ambiguity. In addition, we show that providing the agent with more incentives would induce the agent to perceive a higher risk, and there is a discontinuous jump in the compensation cost as incentives increase, which makes the principal reluctant to reset contracts frequently when underlying fundamentals change. Thus, compensation contracts exhibit an inertia property. Lastly, the model sheds some light on the use of relative performance evaluation and provides a rationale for the puzzle of pay-for-luck in the presence of ambiguity.","[Liu, Qi] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lei] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Sun, Bo] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Peking University; University of Manitoba; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiliu@gsm.pku.edu.cn; Lei.Lu@umanitoba.ca; bo.sun@frb.gov,"Lu, Lei/GLS-7419-2022",,,,,,48,4,4,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This paper introduces an econometric strategy for estimating individual or household-level development resilience from panel data. Estimation of multiple conditional moments of a welfare function-itself specified to permit potentially nonlinear path dynamics-enables the computation and forecasting of individual-specific conditional probabilities of satisfying a normative minimum standard of living.

This study uses U.S. micro-data from 2000 to 2012 (thus including effects of the Great Recession) to examine how displacement (i.e., exogenous job loss) affects the probability of divorce. The author finds displacement significantly increases the probability of divorce but only if the husband is the spouse that is displaced, and his earnings represented approximately half or less of the household's earnings prior to displacement. Similarly, results show that the probability of divorce increases if the wife is employed and as her earnings increase. While the mechanism behind these asymmetric results remains unclear, these results are consistent with recent research that finds a destabilizing effect on marriages when a wife earns more than her husband.","[Banzhaf, Melissa Ruby] US Bur Census, Atlanta Fed Stat Res Data Ctr, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",,"Banzhaf, MR (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Atlanta Fed Stat Res Data Ctr, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",Melissa.r.banzhaf@census.gov,,,,,,,32,4,4,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

I study public housing demolitions in Chicago, which forced low-income households to relocate to less disadvantaged neighborhoods using housing vouchers. Specifically, I compare young adult outcomes of displaced children to their peers who lived in nearby public housing that was not demolished. Displaced children are more likely to be employed and earn more in young adulthood. I also find that displaced children have fewer violent crime arrests. Children displaced at young ages have lower high school dropout rates.","[Chyn, Eric] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Chyn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ericchyn@virgina.edu,,,NICHD [T32 HD007339],NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Department of Economics, University of Virginia, PO Box 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 (email: ericchyn@virgina.edu).

We are interested in the role that historical precedents may play for equilibrium selection between these two repeated games. We find that a precedent for efficient play in the repeated Stag Hunt game does not carry over to the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game despite the possibility that efficient play can be sustained as an equilibrium of the indefinitely repeated game. Similarly, a precedent for inefficient play in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game does not extend to the repeated Stag Hunt game. We conclude that equilibrium selection between similar repeated games may have less to do with historical precedents and might instead depend more on strategic considerations associated with the different payoffs of these similar repeated games.","[Duffy, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Fehr, Dietmar] WZB, Berlin, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Duffy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",duffy@uci.edu; dietmar.fehr@wzb.eu,"Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 1029],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),For helpful comments and suggestions we thank an anonymous referee and participants at the Workshop in Memory of John Van Huyck held at SMU in October 2015.

Empirical evidence indicating negative investment effects of the regulation played a key role in this reversal, though the quantification of these investment effects were a matter of substantial controversy. This article surveys the studies cited in the recent decision and the Commission's scrutiny of them. In all, the Commission considered eight primary works but relied on only two of them, a culling process that relied on four principles: (1) simply comparing outcomes before-and-after an event is not a valid impact analysis; (2) before-and-after comparisons are more probative if regression analysis is used to condition the outcomes by accounting for potentially relevant factors like economic growth, sales, and so forth; (3) the causal effects of a regulation are best determined with reference to a counterfactual; and (4) the application of proper methods does not excuse the use of bad data. These principles are mostly uncontroversial and are consistent with the modern practice of impact analysis.","[Ford, George S.] Phoenix Ctr Adv Legal & Econ, 5335 Wisconsin Ave NW,Ste 440, Washington, DC 20015 USA",,"Ford, GS (通讯作者)，Phoenix Ctr Adv Legal & Econ, 5335 Wisconsin Ave NW,Ste 440, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",ford@phoenix-center.org,,,,,,,31,3,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We start with an overview of the measurement of offshoring, organizing our discussion around the three key elements of offshoring: that it involves intermediate inputs for production (versus final goods for consumption); that it involves imported inputs (versus domestically produced ones); and that the inputs involved could have been produced internally within the same firm. We then briefly discuss the theories of offshoring and survey the literature that examines the wage effects of offshoring: the wave of studies using industry-level data; the wave using firm-level data; the wave using worker-level data; and the wave using matched worker-firm data. For each wave, we highlight the identification strategies used, critically assess its strengths and weaknesses, discuss its connections with theory, and draw out potential policy implications of its findings. Finally, we survey the literature that examines how offshoring affects employment and displacement. We highlight the recent development of a novel cohort-based approach that is specifically designed to address selection with displacement, and capable of identifying the overall effects of offshoring, including wage, displacement, and all other types of transitions.","[Hummels, David; Xiang, Chong] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hummels, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Munch, Jakob R.] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Munch, Jakob R.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Copenhagen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Hummels, D (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Hummels, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Munch, Jakob Roland/0000-0002-4387-1039",,,,,129,62,70,5,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Theoretically, we exploit a structural gravity model to derive a closed-form solution for a widely-used measure of market potential. We are thus able to express market potential as a function of directly observable and easily estimated variables. Empirically, we collect a large dataset on aggregate and bilateral trade flows as well as output for 51 countries. We find that market potential exhibits an upward trend across all regions of the world from the early 1930s and that this trend significantly deviates from the evolution of world GDP. Finally, using exogenous variation in trade-related distances to world markets, we demonstrate a significant causal role of market potential in driving global income growth over this period.

We contribute to this agenda developing the first general equilibrium model designed to study how the geographic distribution of police protection affects the decision to pursue illegal activities, the intensity and location of crime, residential choices, housing prices, and the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. The target is to explore the positive and normative long-run effects of different ways of spatially allocating police forces in an urban area. We find that, when the police protect some neighborhoods (concentrated protection), the city becomes segregated, while when the police are evenly deployed across the city (dispersed protection), an integrated city emerges. Unequal societies face a difficult dilemma in that concentrated protection maximizes aggregate welfare but exacerbates social disparities. Taxes and subsidies can be employed to offset the disadvantages of police concentration. Private security makes an integrated city less likely to occur in equilibrium. Even under dispersed public protection, rich agents may use private security to endogenously isolate themselves in closed neighborhoods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper remedies that omission for the most recent fiscal consolidation attempt in the U.S.: the 2011-mandated budget sequestration spending cuts in discretionary spending slated to begin in 2013. The credibility of those cuts is assessed with a novel methodology that draws on the event study and Business Cycle Accounting traditions. The paper finds that the fiscal austerity program had little, if any, credibility around the time it was scheduled to become effective and that studies that don't take this lack of credibility into account might overestimate the quantitative impact of the budget sequestration on key macroeconomic variables by a factor of three or more. These findings expose the dangers of extrapolating policy lessons extracted from the budget sequestration experience to other fiscal stabilization programs, without gauging first their credibility. Properly adapted and extended, the methodology the paper developed with that purpose could prove useful for the systematic assessment of the credibility of other fiscal stabilization programs, of the impact of their credibility on aggregate outcomes and, ultimately, of the chances of those programs to successfully eliminate structural fiscal imbalances.

When calibrated to the US, the model-implied degree of EOP differs substantially depending on whether one considers it ethical to reward offspring for the effort of previous generations. Despite reducing intragenerational inequality, education subsidies do little to promote EOP. This is because if one thinks intergenerational investments should be rewarded, there is little room for improvement to begin with; in the opposite case, much stronger redistribution is needed for the policies to have a quantitative impact.","[Lee, Sang Yoon (Tim)] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lee, SY (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France.",sylee.tim@tse-fr.eu,"Lee, Tim/JGD-7558-2023",,,,,,55,4,4,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

We find that the technological substitutability between clean and dirty energy inputs may not be that strong, especially in the case of a final-goods sector for which the inter-energy elasticity of substitution statistically exceeds one for at most a third of industries/countries.

This paper focuses on the effects of technology and market assumptions with projections out to 2050. A total of 15 models contributed projections based on a set of standardized scenarios. The scenarios include a range of assumptions about the price of natural gas, costs of end-use energy efficiency, retirements of nuclear power, the cost of renewable electricity, and overall electricity demand. The range of models and scenarios represent similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of analytical methods. One similarity across almost all results from all models and scenarios is that the share of electricity generation and capacity fueled by coal shrinks over time, although the rate at which coal capacity is retired depends on the price of natural gas and the amount of electricity that is demanded. Another similarity is that the models project average increases in natural gas power generating capacity in every scenario over the 2020-2050 period, but at lower average annual rates than those that prevailed during the 2000-2015 period. The projections also include higher gas capacity utilization rates in the 2035-2050 period compared to the 2020-2050 period in every scenario, except the high gas price sensitivity. Renewables capacity is also projected to increase in every scenario, although the annual new capacity varies from modest rates below the observed 2000-2015 wind and solar average to rates more than 3 times that high. Model estimates of CO2 emissions largely follow from the trends in generation. Low renewables cost and low gas prices both result in lower overall CO2 emission rates relative to the 2020-2035 and 2035-2050 reference. Both limited nudear lifetimes and higher demand result in increased CO2 emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that imposing a pollution tax causes substantial reductions in employment in the regulated (polluting) industry, but this is offset by increased employment in the unregulated (nonpolluting) sector. As a result, while the policy causes a substantial shift in employment between industries, the net effect on overall employment (and unemployment) is small, even in the short run. An environmental performance standard causes a substantially smaller sectoral shift in employment than the emissions tax, with roughly similar net effects. Thus, policymakers who want to minimize sectoral shifts in employment might prefer performance standards over environmental taxes. The effects on the unregulated industry suggest that empirical studies of environmental regulation that focus only on regulated firms can be misleading, significantly overstating the net employment effects (and those that use nonregulated firms as controls for regulated firms will be even more misleading, overstating both the net effects and effects on the regulated industry). This implies that overall effects on employment are less of an issue for environmental policy than the empirical literature might suggest.","[Hafstead, Marc A.

Households choose where to live and how much to invest in their child's human capital. The return on parents' investment is determined in part by their child's ability and in part by a neighborhood externality. We calibrate the model using data from Chicago in 1960, assuming that in previous decades households were randomly allocated to, and then could not move from, neighborhoods with different total factor productivity (TFP). This restriction on neighborhood choice allows us to overcome the fundamental problem of endogenous neighborhood selection. We use the calibrated model to study Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that racial equality under the law need not ensure equality of opportunity due to neighborhood dynamics. We examine the consequences of allowing for mobility, equalizing TFP, or both. In line with Wilson, 1987, sorting can lead to persistent inequality of opportunity across locations if initial conditions are unequal. Our results highlight the importance of forward-looking agents.","[Aliprantis, Dionissi; Carroll, Daniel R.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Aliprantis, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",dionissi.aliprantis@clev.frb.org; daniel.carroll@clev.frb.org,,"Carroll, Daniel R./0000-0003-2708-3232; Aliprantis, Dionissi/0000-0002-7013-9353",,,,,92,3,4,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid up front, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just 1 month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.","[Casaburi, Lorenzo] Univ Zurich, Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Willis, Jack] Columbia Univ, 1022 IAB,420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Zurich; Columbia University,"Casaburi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",lorenzo.casaburi@econ.uzh.ch; jw3634@columbia.edu,"Casaburi, Lorenzo/AAM-7956-2020","Casaburi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7752-1125",SIEPR; USAID BASIS,SIEPR; USAID BASIS(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We wish to thank the anonymous referees, as well as Vojta Bartos, Emily Breza, John Campbell, Michael Carter, Shawn Cole, Brian Dillon, David Dorn, Pascaline Dupas, Ram Fishman, Siddharth George, Ed Glaeser, Oliver Hart, Nathan Hendren, Cynthia Kinnan, Michael Kremer, David Laibson, Guilherme Lichand, Craig McIntosh, Mushfiq Mobarak, Sendhil Mullainathan, Nathan Nunn, Matthew Rabin, Gautam Rao, Martin Rotemberg, Frank Schilbach, Andrei Shleifer, Tavneet Suri, Alessandro Tarozzi, Argyris Tsiaras, Chris Udry, Eric Verhoogen, Andrew Weiss, and seminar audiences at ABCA conference, BASIS Technical Meeting, Barcelona Summer Forum, BREAD pre-conference, Cambridge, Columbia, Cornell (Dyson), CREST, CSAE Oxford conference, DIAL conference, ECBE conference, Harvard, IGC International Growth Week, IIES, INSEAD, Lindau meetings, NBER/BREAD development meeting, NBER insurance meeting, NEUDC conference, NOVAFRICA conference, PACDEV conference, PSE, Princeton, Sciences Po, Stanford, TSE, UCL, and UCSD for useful comments.

In particular, we propose a framework for analyzing the tension between static efficiency (pricing behavior) and dynamic efficiency (investment behavior). The investment behavior is rendered endogenous by means of a dynamic model where the current investment depends on the expected future profits. We then use a forward simulation procedure to analyze the effect of an open-access market structure where a new firm uses the network of one of the biggest railroad firm. Under a simple access charge equaled to the marginal cost of access, investment in network infrastructure decreases by 10% per year, leading to a significant decrease in network quality over time. Under this setting, despite the increase of price competition, the decrease in network quality leads to a fall in consumer welfare. Other types of (more evolved) access charges might even allow to relax the tension between static efficiency and dynamic efficiency, allowing more price competition while preserving investment incentives. This topic deserves further research and is beyond the scope of this paper.","[Ivaldi, Marc] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Coublucq, Daniel] Compass Lexecon, Brussels, Belgium; [McCullough, Gerard] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",marc.ivaldi@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The novel approach adopted here is to utilise its predictive ability for the whole distribution of future growth, rather than predicting the center of this distribution directly. Our results confirm previous findings that the yield spread does contain additional information about the future GDP growth, which varies over time. Most importantly, utilising the information contained in the whole conditional distribution of predicted GDP growth, rather than concentrating on the center of it, provides additional forecasting power for shorter (3-9 months) horizons. This approach is also superior in forecasting future expansionary phases, notably a more common phenomenon than recessions for which the traditional, OLS-based forecasts seem to perform better.","[Gebka, Bartosz] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Mammel Hall 332S, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Gebka, B (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",bartosz.gebka@ncl.ac.uk; mwohar@mail.unomaha.edu,"Gebka, Bartosz/I-5189-2019","Gebka, Bartosz/0000-0003-4510-0374; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,60,5,7,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The main challenge is that the aggregate state vector contains the distribution of agents, which is typically infinite-dimensional. I approximate the distribution with a flexible parametric family, reducing its dimensionality to a finite set of endogenous parameters, and solve for the dynamics of these endogenous parameters by perturbation. I implement the method in Dynare and show that it is fast, general, and easy to use. As an illustration, I use the method to perform a Bayesian estimation of a heterogeneous firm model with aggregate shocks to neutral and investment-specific productivity. I find that the behavior of investment at the firm level quantitatively shapes inference about the aggregate shock processes, suggesting an important role for micro data in estimating DSGE models.","[Winberry, Thomas] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Winberry, Thomas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Winberry, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Winberry, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Thomas.Winberry@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,35,21,33,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Keeping higher levels of reserves provides a hedge against rollover risk, but this is costly because using reserves to pay down debt allows the government to reduce sovereign spreads. Our model, parameterized to mimic salient features of a typical emerging economy, can account for significant holdings of international reserves, and the larger accumulation of both debt and reserves in periods of low spreads and high income. We also show that income windfalls, improved policy frameworks, and an increase in the importance of rollover risk imply increases in the optimal holdings of reserves that are consistent with the upward trend in reserves in emerging economies.

High-speed Internet promotes the use of electronic devices, video games and Internet addiction (e.g., online games and cyberloafing). Exposure to artificial light from tablets and PCs can alterate individuals' sleep patterns. However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that access to high-speed Internet (DSL) access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction.

We provide a complete characterization of equilibrium outcomes for regular environments by relying on techniques developed elsewhere for aggregate games and for the mechanism design delegation literature. The set of equilibria includes those with nondifferentiable payoffs and discontinuous choices, as well as equilibria that are smooth and continuous in types. We identify one equilibrium, the maximal equilibrium, which is the unique solution to a self-generating optimization program with the largest (or maximal) domain, and the only equilibrium that is supported with biconjugate (i.e., least-concave) tariffs. The maximal equilibrium exhibits a n-fold distortion caused by each of the n principal's non-cooperative behavior in overharvesting the agent's information rent. Furthermore, in any equilibrium, over any interval of types in which there is full separation, the agent's equilibrium action corresponds to the allocation in the maximal equilibrium. Under reasonable conditions, the maximal equilibrium maximizes the agent's information rent within the class of equilibrium allocations. When the principals' most-preferred equilibrium allocation differs from the maximal equilibrium, we demonstrate that the agent's choice function exhibits an interval of bunching over the worst agent types, and elsewhere corresponds to the maximal allocation. The optimal region of bunching trades off the principals' desire to constrain inefficient n-fold marginalizations of the agent's rent against the inefficiency of pooling agent types.","[Martimort, David] Paris Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France; [Semenov, Aggey] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Stole, Lars A.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Paris School of Economics; University of Ottawa; University of Chicago,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France.",david.martimort@psemail.eu; aggey.semenov@uottawa.ca; lars.stole@chicagobooth.edu,,"Simons, Aggey/0000-0002-0350-9027",,,,,30,2,2,0,1,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Through a narrative analysis, we identify historical policy changes leading to expansions or contractions in agency mortgage holdings. Based on those regulatory events that we classify as unrelated to short-run cyclical or credit market shocks, we find that an increase in mortgage purchases by the agencies boosts mortgage lending, in particular refinancing, and lowers mortgage rates. Agency purchases also influence prices in other asset markets, stimulate residential investment, and expand homeownership. We compare these effects to those of conventional monetary policy shocks, and we provide evidence on the interactions between housing credit and monetary policies.","[Fieldhouse, Andrew J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Dallas, TX USA; UCL, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Ctr Macroecon, London, England",Cornell University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University College London,"Fieldhouse, AJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Mertens, Karel/F-1275-2011","Ravn, Morten/0000-0003-2703-2558","ADEMU (H2020) [649396]; ESRC Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC [ES/R009295/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649396] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme",ADEMU (H2020); ESRC Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"We are grateful to the editor and referees for their comments, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as Shane Sherlund for providing data, and to conference discussants and participants at various seminars for useful comments.

An economy's resilience to crises and recessions can also be strengthened. Minimizing risks requires the accurate monitoring of home-grown vulnerabilities in realtime; coping with the consequences means identifying and putting in place policy settings and mechanisms that can help absorb the impact of a severe downturn and facilitate a swift rebound of economic activity.

Legal-economic theorists argue that legal philosophies such as common law and civil law have developed differently over centuries and have persistent effects. In this paper, we argue that the effects of culture and institutions should not be analyzed in isolation from each other, as this disregards their interactions. We merge the two separate literatures on cultural attributes and legal origin theories, and derive a hypothesis regarding their joint effects on labor market regulations. We hypothesize that the effect of individualism on the political determination of labor regulations should be particularly pronounced in more market-oriented economic systems (as in British common law countries) compared to more rigid and bureaucratic state-centered systems (as in French civil law countries). Market oriented economies give individual effort and ability greater room to flourish, which in individualistic cultures yields weaker labor regulations. The effect of individualism should be smaller in state centered systems. Using data on the average rigidity of labor regulations during the years 1950-2004 in 86 countries, we find that the negative effect of individualism on the rigidity of labor regulations is enhanced by the presence of a common law legal system. In fact, individualism has no effect on the rigidity of labor market regulations in civil law countries. Analogously, the negative effect of common law legal origin on labor market regulations is found to be conditional on the level of individualism. Individualism and common law legal systems are complements in the determination of labor regulations.","[Ang, James B.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Fredriksson, Per G.] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",Nanyang Technological University; University of Louisville,"Ang, JB (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",James.Ang@ntu.edu.sg; per.fredriksson@louisville.edu,"Ang, James B/N-4115-2013","Ang, James/0000-0001-9497-0187; ren, xiao peng/0000-0002-6032-8249",Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2,"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We thank the Editor Hongbin Li, two helpful referees, Michael Baker, Mike Barone, Dann Millimet, Beth Munnich, Bill Neilson, and Laura Tetreault for guidance and insightful comments.

Findings indicate that individuals are financially illiterate while interventions to increase the level of financial literacy are ineffective. The effect of financial literacy on financial behavior reported in correlation studies may be driven by some unknown third variable, such as individual cognitive ability. The current study investigated the role of cognitive and emotional factors in attaining financial literacy. In a representative sample of the general population, our regression models indicate that a central component of financial literacy can be traced to numeracy and the emotional attitude towards numbers (i. e. mathematics anxiety). Thus, a driving force behind becoming financially literate resides in the ability to understand numbers and having an emotional attitude towards numbers that does not interfere with an individual's daily engagement in activities involving mathematics and financial decisions.","[Skagerlund, Kenny; Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Skagerlund, Kenny; Lind, Therese; Stromback, Camilla; Tinghog, Gustav; Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Div Econ, JEDILab, Linkoping, Sweden; [Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Natl Ctr Prior Setting Hlth Care, Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Skagerlund, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.;Skagerlund, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Div Econ, JEDILab, Linkoping, Sweden.",kenny.skagerlund@liu.se,"Västfjäll, Daniel/F-9629-2014; Tinghög, Gustav/K-2961-2012","Tinghög, Gustav/0000-0002-8159-1249; Vastfjall, Daniel/0000-0003-2873-4500; Stromback, Camilla/0000-0002-0269-0899; Skagerlund, Kenny/0000-0003-1894-3595",,,,,41,90,100,2,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

When tax and expenditure policies can affect the market distribution of income in ways that cannot be directly offset, those effects need to be taken into account, reducing the burden imposed on distortionary redistribution. The paper extends the 1976 Atkinson-Stiglitz results to a dynamic, overlapping generations model, correcting a misreading of the result on the desirability of a zero capital tax. That result required separability of consumption from labor and that the only unobservable differences among individuals were in (fixed) labor productivities. In a general equilibrium model, one needs to take into account the effects of policy changes on binding self-selection constraints. In a simple model with time separability but with non-separability between consumption and leisure, capital taxation depends on the complementarity/substitutability of leisure during work with retirement consumption. The final section constructs a simple two class model, capitalists who maximize dynastic welfare and workers who save for retirement, whose productivity can be enhanced by (publicly provided) education. It derives a simple expression for the optimal capital tax, which is positive, so long as the social welfare function is sufficiently equalitarian and the productivity of educational expenditures is sufficiently high.","[Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jes322@columbia.edu,,,INET; Roosevelt Institute; Inequality Project,INET; Roosevelt Institute; Inequality Project,"I am indebted to INET and the Roosevelt Institute, and the supporters of its Inequality Project for financial support; to Matthieu Teachout and to Naafis Mateen for research assistance; to Debarati Ghosh for editorial assistance; and to Simcha Barkai, Martin Guzman, Linus Mattauch, the editor, Henrik Eleven, and an anonymous referee for comments on an earlier draft.",,108,10,10,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

The average immigrant from a middle-income or poor country increases their wage by a factor of two to three upon migration. This wage gain is small relative to the underlying gap in GDP per worker. In a development accounting framework, this finding implies that switching countries accounts for 40% of cross-country income differences, while human capital accounts for 60%. Wage gains decline with education, consistent with imperfect substitution between skill types. We augment our analysis to allow for this possibility and bound the human capital share in development accounting to between one-half and two-thirds.

Those with pro-cyclical payoffs, such as foreign currency debt, generate substantial negative pecuniary externalities because they lead to large repayments and contractionary exchange rate depreciations during financial crises. Conversely, capital flows with an insurance component, such as FDI or equity, are largely benign. We construct an externality pricing kernel and use sufficient statistics and DSGE model simulations to quantify the externalities that materialized during past financial crises. We find stark differences depending on the payoff profile, justifying taxes of up to 3% for dollar debt but close to zero for FDI. These findings contrast with the existing literature, which has suggested that policymakers should focus on reducing over-borrowing rather than changing the composition of external liabilities.

While this may have intuitive appeal, this paper shows that it might be wishful thinking. Economic theory tells us that flexible retirement policies can have a zero or positive effect on labour force participation (LFP) while the effect on hours worked can be positive or negative depending on the distribution of leisure preferences. Thus, the overall effect is ex ante unclear. Empirical results from nine OECD countries show that the effect on LFP is ex post small and positive while the effect on hours worked is negative. Overall, there is no evidence of the desired positive effect on total labour supply (TLS). We conclude that the flexibility reforms enacted so far are dangerous instruments if one wants to increase TLS because they postpone or even replace the instalment of more effective policies and may, even worse, reduce total labour volume.","[Boersch-Supan, Axel] Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Munich, Germany; Max Planck Inst fu Sozialrecht & Sozialpolit, Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Technical University of Munich; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Börsch-Supan, A (通讯作者)，Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Munich, Germany.",boersch-supan@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de,,,,,,,72,18,18,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We draw on models of fictitious play and adaptive learning to analyze how this convergence occurs and show that these models predict behavior better than an equilibrium model prior to convergence.","[Doraszelski, Ulrich] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doraszelski, Ulrich] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Doraszelski, Ulrich; Lewis, Gregory; Pakes, Ariel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lewis, Gregory] Microsoft Res New England, Microsoft Res, 1 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pakes, Ariel] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 117,1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Microsoft; Harvard University,"Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Doraszelski, U (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",doraszelski@wharton.upenn.edu; glewis@microsoft.com; apakes@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,54,32,56,1,46,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Exploiting a reform in Germany that induced school districts to expand ECC at different points in time, we find strong but diverging effects on children's motor and socio-emotional skills. Children who were most likely to attend ECC benefit in terms of their motor skill development. Children who were least likely to attend ECC gain in terms of their socio-emotional skill development, especially boys and children from disadvantaged families, such as those with low education or migration backgrounds. Simulating expansions of ECC, we find that a moderate expansion fosters motor skills for all children and language skills for boys and immigrant children. A progressive expansion of ECC improves all children's socio-emotional development but neither their motor skills nor their language skills.","[Felfe, Christina] Univ St Gallen, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Felfe, Christina; Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Lalive, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lalive, Rafael] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of St Gallen; Ifo Institut; University of Lausanne; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Christina.Felfe@unisg.ch; Rafael.Lalive@unil.ch,,"Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives (NCCR LIVES) - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-160590]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Economic Policy Profile Area of the University of St. Gallen,Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives (NCCR LIVES) - Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Economic Policy Profile Area of the University of St. Gallen,"We would like to thank Olof Aslund, Michael Baker, Mark Dusheiko, Martin Eckhoff Andresen, Maria Fitzpatrick, Eric French, Martin Huber, Steven Lehrer, Edwin Leuven, Michael Kosfeld, Patrick Kline, Claudia Senik, Marianne Simonsen, Mark Stabile, Sergio Urzua, Chris White, Ludger WOssmann, Danny Yagan, the editor and three anonymous referees for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

In the model, continuing restaurants cannot change employment, and thus industry-level adjustment occurs gradually through exit of labor-intensive restaurants and entry of capital-intensive restaurants. Interestingly, the putty-clay model matches the small estimated short-run disemployment effect of the minimum wage found in other studies, but produces a larger long-run disemployment effect.","Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; UCL, IFS, London, England; CEPR, London, England; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Unaffiliated, Cambridge, MA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"French, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",eric.french.econ@gmail.com,,,"ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/P001831/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,49,65,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Agents are randomly matched in pairs to engage in a prisoner dilemma. The matching process is assortative in actions, that is, cooperators are more likely to be matched with cooperators, defectors are more likely to be matched with defectors. Agents exhibit a form of cultural intolerance: when two agents of different cultures are matched, they suffer a cost due to their cultural differences. We find that when cultural intolerance is sufficiently strong, homophily emerges together with perfect correlation between culture and behavior: all agents from one cultural group cooperate, while all agents from the other cultural group defect, and interactions among agents within the same cultural group are more frequent. The relation between cultural intolerance and societal welfare is non-monotonic. In particular, stronger cultural intolerance can increase cooperation when action-assortativity is weak, while it can increase defection when action-assortativity is strong. Moreover, everyone cooperating does not necessarily maximize total welfare unless cultural intolerance can be made sufficiently weak. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the impact of state CON programs for HHAs, and for potential substitute service providers, on quality ratings for HHAs. HHA quality ratings were obtained from the Home Health Compare database developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the last quarter of 2010 through the last quarter of 2013. The HHA-level data were augmented with county-level area characteristics for each HHA in the CMS database. An ordered logit model was used to estimate the association between state CON restrictions and Low, Medium, and High quality categories, adjusted for HHA and area characteristics. The results indicated that HHAs in states with CON for HHAs were less likely to have High quality ratings, and more likely to have Medium quality ratings, compared to agencies in states without CON for home health. Additional research is needed to assess whether the apparent adverse impact of CON on HHA quality is related to diminished competition among HHAs in states with CON.","[Ohsfeldt, Robert L.] Texas A&M Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 1266 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Ohsfeldt, RL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 1266 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",rohsfeldt@tamu.edu; penli@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,"Ohsfeldt, Robert/AAG-6514-2019","Ohsfeldt, Robert/0000-0002-6117-056X",Arkansas Center for Research in Economics,Arkansas Center for Research in Economics,Partial funding support was provided by the Arkansas Center for Research in Economics.,,32,5,7,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We derive a conceptual model showing how the level and variability of price perceptions outside the task at hand might affect choice behavior, and we conduct an experiment to test the model by manipulating information provided to respondents in a way to alter the outside the experiment perceptions. Mixed logit, error component models show that reference-dependent models best describe the choice data, and we find that consumer choice is significantly affected by the experiment manipulations. The predictions of the model are borne out in the data. As expected, price sensitivity is generally higher for price changes above a price reference point than below. Also as predicted, exogenously increasing external reference prices and exogenously reducing the variability in references prices both serve to increase the probability of making a purchase and reduce the probability of choosing none. These results have important implications for the design and practice of choice experiments, as they show that consumer choice is affected by perceptions of the level and variability of prices outside the experiment. More generally, the results highlight the need to understand the formation and distribution of reference prices when predicting consumer choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This has not been the case in Louisiana since a 1995 constitutional amendment required a two-thirds majority of the state legislature for any tuition increase. In November of 2016, voters in Louisiana rejected Amendment 2, a constitutional amendment that would have given state institutions of higher education autonomy in setting tuition. We examine parish-level voting on Amendment 2 using an empirical political economy model and find that parishes with a greater percentage of African-Americans and university employees were more likely to vote yes.

This type of temptation is ubiquitous, as it refers to any temptation that is present until one either gives in or makes a costly commitment decision to have it removed. Subjects in our experiment are repeatedly offered an option with instantaneous benefit that also entails a substantial reduction to overall earnings. We show that this option is tempting in the sense that a substantial fraction of our subjects incur pecuniary costs to eliminate the choice, and thus commit not to choose this alternative. We find that commitment and giving in to temptation generally occur at the first opportunity, though a non-negligible fraction of subjects delay either making the commitment decision or giving in to temptation. This delay is consistent with the costs of self-control increasing with its use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, research on the fetal origins hypothesis is flourishing and has expanded to include the early childhood (postnatal) environment. Why does this literature have a second act? We summarize the major themes and contributions driving the empirical literature since our 2011 reviews, and try to interpret the literature in light of an overarching conceptual framework about how human capital is produced early in life. One major finding is that relatively mild shocks in early life can have substantial negative impacts, but that the effects are often heterogeneous reflecting differences in child endowments, budget constraints, and production technologies. Moreover, shocks, investments, and interventions can interact in complex ways that are only beginning to be understood. Many advances in our knowledge are due to increasing accessibility of comprehensive administrative data that allow events in early life to be linked to long-term outcomes. Yet, we still know relatively little about the interval between, and thus about whether it would be feasible to identify and intervene with affected individuals at some point between early life and adulthood. We do know enough, however, to be able to identify some interventions that hold promise for improving child outcomes in early life and throughout the life course.","[Almond, Douglas] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Almond, Douglas; Currie, Janet] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Currie, Janet] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Duque, Valentina] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Almond, D (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Almond, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES-1357608],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Almond: Columbia University and NBER.

We identify structural breaks in macroeconomic aggregates during the 1990s and associate them with the zero interest-rate policy pursued by the Bank of Japan and the surprise increase in the consumption tax rate in April 1997. Formal estimation using the generalized methods of moments shows that the mid-1990s are characterized by breaks in the structural parameters governing household consumption and labour supply decisions. Specifically, following the tax hike and during the low nominal rate period, Japanese households became less risk averse and exhibited a higher degree of habit formation.","[Lecznar, Jonathon] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lubik, Thomas A.] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Dept Econ, Richmond, VA USA",Boston University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Lubik, TA (通讯作者)，Res Dept, POB 27622, Richmond, VA 23261 USA.",thomas.lubik@rich.frb.org,,,,,,,15,1,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We estimate the parameters of the model using US Census microdata on firm-level output, R&D, and patenting. The model provides a good fit to the dynamics of firm entry and exit, output, and R&D. Taxing the continued operation of incumbents can lead to sizable gains (of the order of 1.4 percent improvement in welfare) by encouraging exit of less productive firms and freeing up skilled labor to be used for R&D by high-type incumbents. Subsidies to the R&D of incumbents do not achieve this objective because they encourage the survival and expansion of low-type firms.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Akcigit, Ufuk; Bloom, Nicholas] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Akcigit, Ufuk; Bloom, Nicholas; Kerr, William] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Akcigit, Ufuk] Univ Chicago, Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Alp, Harun] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 133 South 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kerr, William] Harvard Sch Business, Rock Ctr 212, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kerr, William] Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of Pennsylvania; Stanford University; Harvard University; Bank of Finland,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.;Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",daron@mit.edu; uakcigit@uchicago.edu; harun.alp@gmail.com; nbloom@stanford.edu; wkerr@hbs.edu,"Akcigit, Ufuk/IXD-8968-2023; Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019","Akcigit, Ufuk/0000-0002-8908-7645",Harvard Business School; Innovation Policy and the Economy forum; National Science Foundation; University of Pennsylvania; NSF [ITR-0427889]; Kauffman Foundation,Harvard Business School; Innovation Policy and the Economy forum; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Pennsylvania; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Kauffman Foundation,"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Martin Eichenbaum, Coeditor.

In both countries, support for increased education spending and teacher salaries falls when respondents receive information about existing levels. Treatment effects vary by prior knowledge in a manner consistent with information effects rather than priming. Support for salary increases is inversely related to salary levels across American states, suggesting that higher salaries could explain much of Germans' lower support for increases. Information about the tradeoffs between specific spending categories shifts preferences from class-size reduction towards alternative purposes.

In this paper we provide measures of inequality of opportunity in wages and consumption for Egypt at different points in time from 1988 to 2012 that shed light on the gap between popular perceptions and measured indices of inequality. Our findings indicate that although measures of inequality of wage income have increased over time in Egypt starting in 1998, the share attributable to circumstances declined steadily throughout the whole period.

In this model, asset prices are volatile, and price-earnings ratios are persistent, even though there is no fundamental uncertainty and financial markets are sequentially complete. I show that the model can explain a substantial risk premium while generating smooth time series for consumption. In my model, asset price fluctuations are Pareto inefficient and there is a role for treasury or central bank intervention to stabilize asset price volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluate the effect of countercyclical policy by estimating a Vector Autoregression (VAR) with regime switching. Because the size of the policy shock is important in our model, we can evaluate the effect of smoothing the interest rate on the path of macro variables. Our model also allows for variation in transition probabilities across regimes, depending on the level of output growth. Thus, changes in the stance of monetary policy affect the macroeconomic variables in a nonlinear way, both directly and indirectly through the state of the economy. We also incorporate a factor summarizing overall sentiment into the VAR to determine if sentiment changes substantially around turning points and whether they are indeed important to understanding the effects of policy.

Our paper extends evidence on this question by subjecting the hypothesis to an alternative context that eliminates many competing hypotheses. We do this by aggregating representative individual-level data for high schools from a single US state (Wisconsin) in 1957, when the population was composed nearly entirely of individuals of European ancestry. Using this sample of high school aggregations, we too find a strong association between school-level genetic diversity and a range of student socioeconomic outcomes. Our use of survey data also allows for a greater exploration into the potential mechanisms of genetic diversity. In doing so, we find positive associations between genetic diversity and indexes for openness to experience and extraversion, two personality traits tied to creativity and divergent thinking.","[Cook, C.

The model is motivated by novel facts that relate container usage to shipment, destination and firm characteristics. We find container transport to have a higher first-mile cost and a lower distance elasticity, making it cost effective in longer distances. At the median distance across all country pairs, the container decreases variable shipping costs between 16 and 22%. Containerization explains a significant amount of the global trade increase since its inception: a quantitative exercise suggests that, in the absence of containers, Turkish and U.S. maritime exports in a typical sector to the average destination market would have been about two-thirds, and aggregate maritime exports 14 to 21% lower than what they are today, respectively.

Exploiting variation in the age of children when families move, we find that neighborhoods have significant childhood exposure effects: the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood-as measured by the outcomes of children already living there-improve linearly in proportion to the amount of time they spend growing up in that area, at a rate of approximately 4% per year of exposure. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles to implement overidentification tests. The findings show that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility primarily through childhood exposure, helping reconcile conflicting results in the prior literature.","[Chetty, Raj] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"IRS [TIRNO-12-P-00374]; National Science Foundation; Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","IRS; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","An earlier version of this article was circulated as Part I of The Impacts of Neighborhoods on Intergenerational Mobility: Childhood Exposure Effects and County Level Estimates.

By using a large dataset on Italian public procurement, we empirically study the effects of court inefficiency on public work performance. Where courts are inefficient, we find the following: public works are delivered with longer delays; delays increase for more valuable contracts; contracts are more often awarded to larger suppliers; and a higher share of the payment is postponed after delivery.

This study presents evidence that women's preferences over competition change with age such that the gender gap, while large for young adults, disappears in older populations due to the fact that older women are much more competitive. Our finding that tastes for competition appear just as strong among older women as they are among men suggests a simple gender-based view of competitiveness is misleading; age seems just as important as sex.

Consistent with the findings of a large empirical literature, we find that parental migration has a significantly negative impact on left-behind children's educational outcomes as measured by test scores in Chinese and math. But unlike much of the existing studies on the subject, we focus on the remediation effect of return migrant parents on once left-behind children's performance. This empirical strategy allows us to avoid the endogeneity issue concerning the migration decision that may have contaminated previous studies. We find evidence that return migrant parents help alleviate the harms caused by parental migration, and the remediation effect is stronger for children attending middle schools, and stronger for daughters. We also find suggestive evidence that return migrant parents improve children's performance through increases in after-school study time and education-related expenditures, following the return of migrant parents.","[Liu, Zhiqiang] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY USA; [Liu, Zhiqiang; Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiang] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Central University of Finance & Economics; Boston College,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zliu@buffalo.edu; liyu@cufe.edu.cn; zhengxr@bc.edu,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Yu, Li/0000-0003-0067-6548; Zheng, Xiang/0000-0002-1880-650X",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9154034]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403303]; Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan at Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP1604],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan at Central University of Finance and Economics,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Project No. 9154034), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71403303), Program for Innovation Research and Talented Youth Plan (Project No. QYP1604) at Central University of Finance and Economics.

We use a composed error model to estimate the stochastic part of firms' strategic pricing equation. This part is formed by two random variables: a traditional error term, which captures random shocks, and a random conduct term, which measures the degree of market power. This approach allows for the conduct parameter to vary flexibly across firms and within firms over time, and avoids ad hoc structural restrictions for identifying firms' conduct. The empirical application of our approach is based on a well-known California wholesale electricity market data set, which has been rigorously used to study market power. Our results suggest that realization of market power varies over both time and firms, and reject the assumption of a common or time-invariant conduct parameter.

RTOs are designed to be stakeholder-driven organizations, with rules and policies crafted through a highly participatory process. While the decisions that RTOs make have implications for industry, society and the environment, their decision processes have not been modeled in any systematic way. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework for the stakeholder process of PJM, an RTO serving thirteen states plus the District of Columbia, adapting some of the seminal literature from political science and political economy on the theory of voting systems. This modeling framework can generate predictions of stakeholder process outcomes, identify strong coalitions among stakeholders and identify shifts in political power in the formulation of RTO market rules. We illustrate this analysis framework using a detailed data set from stakeholder deliberations of capacity market reform in PJM. Our model predicts that the current structure of the stakeholder process in PJM makes the passage of capacity market reforms through the stakeholder process virtually impossible because it creates strong coalitions that would favor or oppose changes to capacity market rules.

There is widespread acknowledgement that the prevailing dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models performed poorly, but little agreement on what alternative future paradigm should be pursued. This article is the elaboration of four blog posts that together present a clear message: current DSGE models are flawed, but they contain the right foundations and must be improved rather than discarded. Further, we need different types of macroeconomic models for different purposes. Specifically, there should be five kinds of general equilibrium models: a common core, plus foundational theory, policy, toy, and forecasting models. The different classes of models have a lot to learn from each other, but the goal of full integration has proven counterproductive. No model can be all things to all people.","[Blanchard, Olivier] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Blanchard, Olivier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Blanchard, O (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Blanchard, O (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",blanchar@mit.edu,,,,,,,19,106,115,4,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Using the restructuring of the U.S. electricity market as our case study, we find support for our theoretical predictions. Our findings imply a greater emphasis on efficiency at coal mines contracting with restructured plants. The evidence suggests a 17% improvement in productivity at these mines, relative to those contracting with regulated plants. We find, on the other hand, that transaction costs may have increased.

Among these benchmarks are a variety of breakeven points (also called breakeven costs or breakeven prices), widely used to predict producer responses to market conditions. These analyses have not proved reliable because (1) there has been no broadly accepted agreement on the definitions of breakeven points, (2) there are various breakeven points (and other benchmarks) each of which is applicable only at a certain stage of the development of a resource, and (3) each breakeven point is considerably more dynamic than many observers anticipated, changing over time in response to internal and external drivers. In this paper we propose standardized definitions of each breakeven point, showing which elements of field and well development are included in each. We clarify the purpose of each breakeven point and specify at which stage of the development cycle the use of each becomes appropriate. We discuss in general terms the geological, geographical, product quality, and exchange rate factors that affect breakeven points. We describe other factors that contribute to tight oil market dynamics, including factors that accelerate the growth and retard the decline of production; technological and legal influences on the behavior of market participants; and infrastructure, labor, and financial inelasticities. The role of tight oil in short-term and medium-term oil market stability is discussed. Finally, we explore the implications of a broader, more rigorous, and more consistent application of the breakeven point concept, taking into account the inelasticities that accompany it.

We characterize the planner's problem and show that relative quantities between any two firms are the same in both planner's allocation and the decentralized economy. As a result, any inefficiency is driven by a discrepancy in the firm entry and exit thresholds. We calibrate the model using Colombian plant-level data and demonstrate how policies directly affecting firm entry and exit can be welfare enhancing.

Therefore, we propose that in examining exchange rate volatility effect on trade, consideration must be given to not just asymmetric effects of exchange rate volatility but also asymmetric effects of the third-country effect.

While existing studies define land productivity or yields as self reported production divided by plot size, we consider an alternative approach to estimating yields based on crop cuts. The crop-cut method entails measuring and harvesting randomly selected subplots by trained technicians, and is recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization for the accurate measurement of crop production. Using data of rural Ethiopia, our analysis indicates that the IR is strong when based on self-reported production, but disappears when based on crop-cut estimates. Our inference from these findings is that the IR is an artifact of systematic over-reporting of production by farmers on small plots, and under-reporting on larger plots. We also discuss how rejecting the inverse plot-size productivity relationship has significant implications for the inverse farm-size productivity relationship.","[Desiere, Sam] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jolliffe, Dean] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jolliffe, Dean] Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",Ghent University; The World Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Desiere, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",sam.desiere@gmail.com; djolliffe@worldbank.org,,,UK Department for International Development Ethiopia (EFO) [936-DEC00071]; FWO Research Organization [V404816N],UK Department for International Development Ethiopia (EFO); FWO Research Organization,The authors are grateful to the UK Department for International Development Ethiopia (EFO number 936-DEC00071) and Tim Conway for generous funding assistance.

We shed light on the role medical residents play in hospital production by using a data-driven parametric approach based on the directional technology distance function. Our primary goal is to assess the extent to which one of the two roles of medical residents empirically dominates the other and to see whether the role varies across different types of hospital. Using the American Hospital Association data from 1994 to 2010, we find that residents are inputs in all rural and public non-teaching hospitals, but they are outputs in urban-area not-for-profit teaching hospitals. We also demonstrate that the status of residents is related to the case-mix index and can vary with hospital size.","[Ferrier, Gary D.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Leleu, Herve; Valdmanis, Vivian G.] IESEG Sch Management, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Lille, France; [Leleu, Herve; Vardanyan, Michael] LEM CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France; [Valdmanis, Vivian G.] Western Michigan Univ, Program Publ Hlth, Grand Rapids, MI USA; [Vardanyan, Michael] IESEG Sch Management, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Socle Grande Arche 1, F-92044 Paris, France",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Western Michigan University; IESEG School of Management,"Vardanyan, M (通讯作者)，IESEG Sch Management, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Socle Grande Arche 1, F-92044 Paris, France.",m.vardanyan@ieseg.fr,"Leleu, Hervé/B-5729-2013","Leleu, Hervé/0000-0003-4027-5175; Vardanyan, Michael/0000-0002-6895-9045; Ferrier, Gary/0000-0001-7301-7928",,,,,30,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Towards the first objective, we apply linear and non-linear methods for delineating the production gap cycle in the Macedonian economy. As for the second objective, we apply autoregressive methods to assess the size and speed of cyclical adjustment of the Macedonian economy to output shocks to the Euro-zone economy. The results of our analysis suggest a high degree of synchronization of the Macedonian business cycles with the cycles of the EU economy. Also, the shocks in economic activity in the Euro-zone economy are transmitted almost instantaneously, and with a large magnitude, to the Macedonian economy. Finally, the impact of the Euro-zone output contraction is less pronounced than the impact of the Euro-zone output expansion, suggesting an impact of the country's autonomous countercyclical economic policies.","[Filipovski, Vladimir; Trpeski, Predrag] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia; [Bogoev, Jane] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje; The World Bank,"Filipovski, V (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",vladfil@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; predrag@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; jbogoev@worldbank.org,,"Filipovski, Vladimir/0000-0002-3910-9770; Trpeski, Predrag/0000-0003-2454-6342",,,,,23,2,2,0,1,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65,5,,,,,609,631,,10.2298/PAN160209017F,0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000454464700005,0

When the informativeness of private signals is unbounded, it is known that agents converge to the correct action and correct belief. We study how quickly convergence occurs, and show that it happens more slowly than it does when agents observe signals. However, we also show that the speed of learning from actions can be arbitrarily close to the speed of learning from signals. In particular, the expected time until the agents stop taking the wrong action can be either finite or infinite, depending on the private signal distribution. In the canonical case of Gaussian private signals we calculate the speed of convergence precisely, and show explicitly that, in this case, learning from actions is significantly slower than learning from signals.

Even allowing for general measurement error (e.g., the measurement error is endogenous), it is still possible to obtain finite bounds on the local average treatment effect. Notably, the Wald estimand is an upper bound on the local average treatment effect, but it is not the sharp bound in general. I also provide a confidence interval for the local average treatment effect with uniformly asymptotically valid size control. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the identification strategy of this paper offers a new use of repeated measurements for tightening the identified set.","[Ura, Takuya] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ura, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",takura@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,52,11,11,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The expansion removes the requirement that young individuals need to be enrolled as full-time students in order to remain on their parents' health insurance past the age of 18 and expands the coverage mandate to age 26 irrespective of student status. This changes the incentives for the full-time college enrollment decisions of young individuals. We use panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for the years 2003-2013 and estimate that the dependent coverage expansion under the ACA decreases the probability to enroll as full-time student by 3 percentage points using a difference-in-differences framework. Furthermore, we find that part-time college enrollment is unaffected by the new policy. The results are robust to changes in the model specification and become stronger when we increase the sample overlap between treatment and control groups using trimming based on propensity scores.","[Jung, Juergen; Shrestha, Vinish] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Jung, J (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",jjung@towson.edu; vshrestha@towson.edu,,"Shrestha, Vinish/0000-0003-3062-7931; Jung, Juergen/0000-0003-3791-6293",,,,,67,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

These plans should specify at least three characteristics that would act as stopping rules for the replicator: (1) how much flowtime the replicator will spend, (2) how much money and effort (working hours) the replicator will spend, and (3) the intended results and the precision of the replication necessary for success. A researcher's replication will be successful according to context-specific criteria in the preanalysis plan. The author also argues that the two biggest drawbacks of preanalysis plans-(1) that they discount unexpected but extraordinary findings and (2) that they make it difficult for researchers to prespecify all possible actions in their decision trees-are less relevant for replications compared with new research. He concludes with describing a preanalysis plan for replicating a paper on housing demand and household formation.","[Chang, Andrew C.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Chang, AC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",a.christopher.chang@gmail.com,,"Chang, Andrew/0000-0002-9769-789X",,,,,14,4,4,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 22,2018,12,,,,,,,,201839,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-39,0,,,8,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GK6RF,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436316300001,0

The effect of geopolitical risks (GPRs) is found to be heterogeneous across the BRICS stock markets, suggesting that news regarding geopolitical tensions do not affect return dynamics in these markets in a uniform way. GPRs are generally found to impact stock market volatility measures rather than returns, and often at return quantiles below the median, indicating the role of GPRs as a driver of bad volatility in these markets. While Russia bears the greatest risk exposure to GPRs in terms of both return and volatility, India is found to be the most resilient BRICS nation in the group. Noting that geopolitical shocks and in particular terrorist incidents are largely unanticipated, our findings underscore the importance of a strong financial sector that can help return the market to stability and an open economy that allows local investors to diversify country-specific risks in their portfolios.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Bonato, Matteo] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Demirer, Riza] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; Montpellier Business School; University of Johannesburg; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Demirer, R (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; mbonato@uj.ac.za; rdemire@siue.edu; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Demirer, Riza/D-2981-2015; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","Demirer, Riza/0000-0002-1840-8085; BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,43,149,154,9,82,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Using the cointegration approach, we find a significant and complete pass-through for SME lending rates. For consumer lending rates, we estimate the pass-through as unreliable. For both the mortgage and corporate rates, the passthrough shows significant structural shifts that can be entirely and largely explained by bank deleveraging. The markup for all lending rates, except for the corporate rates, increases with a growing spread between the government bond and monetary policy rates.

Previous experimental studies have shown that these higher-order risk preferences affect the choices of individuals deciding privately on lotteries that only affect their own payoff. Yet, many risky and financially relevant decisions are made in the social settings of households or organizations. We elicit higher-order risk preferences of individuals and systematically vary how an individual's decision is made (alone or while communicating with a partner) and who is affected by the decision (only the individual or the partner as well). In doing so, we can isolate the effects of other-regarding concerns and communication on choices. Our results reveal that the majority of choices are risk averse, prudent, and temperate across social settings. We also observe that individuals are influenced significantly by the preferences of a partner when they are able to communicate and choices are payoff-relevant for both of them.","[Heinrich, Timo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Stralsund Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business Studies, Stralsund, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA USA; [Mayrhofer, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Durham University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",timo.heinrich@ibes.uni-due.de,,"Mayrhofer, Thomas/0000-0001-6287-5185; Heinrich, Timo/0000-0001-6827-1374",German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 655]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies [01UC1304],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the IN-EAST School of Advanced Studies,"We thank the co-editor Charles N.

We conduct laboratory experiments in which subjects choose between a risky (in terms of exposure to unemployment) and a secure job after being assigned in early rounds to both types of jobs. Both jobs involve the same typing task. The risky job adds the element of a known probability that the typing opportunity will not be available in any given period. Subjects were informed of the exogenous risk premium being offered for the risky job. Women were more likely than men to select the secure job, and these job choices accounted for between 40% and 77% of the gender wage gap in the experiments. A method for classifying subjects according to risk preferences is derived from the theoretical framework and further demonstrates the higher incidence of risk aversion among women.","[Jung, SeEun] Inha Univ, Incheon, South Korea; [Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, ERICA Campus, Seoul, South Korea; [Oaxaca, Ronald L.] Univ Arizona, PRESAGE, LISER, IZA, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Inha University; Hanyang University; University of Arizona,"Choe, C (通讯作者)，55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr,"Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",University of Arizona; Georgia State University; Kent State University; University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics [Fond de Recherche PSE 2014/2015-Dossier N4],University of Arizona; Georgia State University; Kent State University; University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"We gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from Alberto Davila, Martin Dufwenberg, Jungmin Lee, Alston Mackenzie, Gary Solon, and from conference and seminar participants at the University of Arizona, Georgia State University, Kent State University, and the University of Paris I/Paris School of Economics.

Although revenue has declined sharply, evidence that weakened effective copyright protection undermines creation has been elusive. Instead, because of cost-reducing effects of digitization, the number of new recorded music products - and their apparent quality - has increased. This study examines movie production in India during a period of technological change that facilitated large-scale piracy. The diffusion of the VCR and cable television in India between 1985 and 2000 created substantial opportunities for unpaid movie consumption. We undertake a case study of this episode to shed light on possible impacts of piracy on supply. We first document, from narrative sources, conditions conducive to piracy as these technologies diffused. We then provide strong circumstantial evidence of piracy in diminished appropriability: movies' revenues fell by a third to a half, conditional on their ratings by movie-goers and their ranks in their annual revenue distributions. Weaker effective demand undermined creative incentives. While the number of new movies released had grown steadily from 1960 to 1985, it fell markedly between 1985 and 2000, suggesting a supply elasticity in the range of 0.2-0.7. Thus, our study provides suggestive evidence on a central tenet of copyright policy, that stronger effective copyright protection effects more creation. We contrast our findings with evidence from other contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We present experimental evidence on this question in the context of a policy change in Indonesia that led to a permanent doubling of teacher base salaries. Using a large-scale randomized experiment across a representative sample of Indonesian schools that accelerated this pay increase for teachers in treated schools, we find that the large pay increase significantly improved teachers' satisfaction with their income, reduced the incidence of teachers holding outside jobs, and reduced self-reported financial stress. Nevertheless, after two and three years, the increase in pay led to no improvement in student learning outcomes. The effects are precisely estimated, and we can rule out even modest positive impacts on test scores. Our results suggest that unconditional pay increases are unlikely to be an effective policy option for improving the effort and productivity of incumbent employees in public-sector settings.","[de Ree, Joppe] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands",The World Bank; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"de Ree, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,"This evaluation would not have been possible without generous financial support from the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

We also use our method to build a Millennium Development Goals (MDG) index as an example of constructing a more complex index. We find the living standard dimension provides a greater contribution to human development than the official HDI suggests, while the longevity dimension provides a lower proportional contribution. Our results also show considerable levels of disagreement relative to the ranks of official HDI.

First, we derive sup-norm convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series two-stage least squares) estimators of h(0) and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating h(0) and its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax rates when h(0) is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for collections of nonlinear functionals of h(0) under primitive conditions, allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications, we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss (DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated via sieve NPIV. Our real data application of UCBs for exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand reveals interesting patterns and is applicable to other goods markets.","[Chen, Xiaohong] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Christensen, Timothy M.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",Yale University; New York University,"Chen, XH (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",xiaohong.chen@yale.edu; timothy.christensen@nyu.edu,,,Cowles Foundation,Cowles Foundation,"This paper is a revised version of the preprint arXiv:1508:03365v1 (Chen and Christensen (2015a)) which was submitted to Econometrica in March 2015 and was a major extension of Sections 2 and 3 of the preprint arXiv:1311.0412 (Chen and Christensen (2013)).

We contend that the endogenous industrialization of the inter-war period generated political changes that paved the way for import-substitution industrialization during the post-war period.

In a field experiment requiring real effort, we investigate how schools can increase students' perseverance in math by shaping students' beliefs in their abilities to learn, a concept referred to by psychologists as mindset. Using protocols adapted from psychology, we experimentally manipulate students' beliefs in their ability to learn. Three weeks after our treatment, we find persistent treatment effects on students' perseverance and academic performance in math.

We show that the mortgage expansion was shared across the entire income distribution; that is, the flow and stock of debt rose across all income groups (except for the top 5%). The mortgage expansion was especially pronounced in areas with increased house prices, and the speed at which houses turned over (churn) in these areas went up significantly. However, the average loan-to-value ratios (LTV) at origination did not increase over the boom period. While homeownership rates increased for the middle- and upper-income households, there was no increase in homeownership for the lowest income groups. Finally, default rates postcrisis went up predominantly in areas with large house price drops, especially for high-income and high-FICO borrowers. These results are consistent with a view that the run-up in mortgage debt over the precrisis period was driven by rising home values and expectations of increasing prices.","[Adelino, Manuel] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Adelino, Manuel; Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schoar, Antoinette] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Severino, Felipe] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Dartmouth College,"Adelino, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Adelino, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Adelino, Manuel/AAK-2869-2020","Adelino, Manuel/0000-0002-6308-8930",,,,,49,16,19,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

We use person fixed effects within both linear and two-part models, the latter to explore changes at extensive and intensive margins. A lower educated group (likely affected by minimum wages) is compared with higher educated groups (likely unaffected). Within the lower educated group, we find higher minimum wages are associated with lower rates of absence due to own and others' illness combined and due to own illness alone, but not associated with absence due to others' illness. A $1 increase in the real minimum wage results in 19 % (in DD model) and 32 % (DDD) decreases in the absence rate due to own illness evaluated at the mean. These findings are strongest for persons who are not employed year-round and among the lowest wage earners. In additional analysis, we show that these effects are likely not due to changes in labor supply or job-related attributes. Instead, we find a possible mechanism: higher minimum wages improve self-reported health for lower educated workers.","[Du, Juan] Old Dominion Univ, Econ, Constant Hall 2034, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Leigh, J.

Censored and double-hurdle regression models are used to estimate the relative contributions of bond-level, issuer-level, and macroeconomic factors that determine this distance, separately for those rated at or below the sovereign rating and those rated above. For the three quarters or more of sub-sovereign bond ratings that are constrained by the sovereign rating ceiling, a Tobit regression model shows a smaller distance - suggesting stronger sovereign-corporate linkages - for public sector enterprises and financial firms relative to other firms. Riskier global financial conditions are also associated with sub-sovereign bonds being rated closer to the sovereign rating. For the small number of sub-sovereign bonds rated higher than the sovereign rating, a double-hurdle model shows that certain debt features - such as bonds backed by future-flow receivables or other collateral or structured as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) - significantly raise the likelihood of piercing the sovereign rating ceiling and also increase the distance above the sovereign ceiling.","[Mohapatra, Sanket] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Nose, Manabu] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Ratha, Dilip] World Bank, Migrat & Remittances Unit, Dev Econ Vice Presidency, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Mohapatra, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, IIM Old Campus, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",sanketm@iima.ac.in,"Ratha, Dilip/AAY-6419-2021",,"DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India","DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India","This work was supported by the DEC Research Support Budget, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA; Research and Publications Committee, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India.",,41,13,13,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the statistics literature, one explanation for class imbalance that has been hypothesized is an asymmetric (rather than the typically symmetric) choice probability function. Unfortunately, few relatively simple models exist for testing this hypothesis in transportation settings-settings that are inherently multinomial. Our paper fills this gap. In particular, we address the following questions: how can one construct asymmetric, closed-form, finite-parameter models of multinomial choice and how do such models compare against commonly used symmetric models? Methodologically, we introduce (1) a new class of closed-form, finite-parameter, multinomial choice models, (2) a procedure for using these models to extend existing binary choice models to the multinomial setting, and (3) a procedure for creating new binary choice models (both symmetric and asymmetric). Together, our contributions allow us to create new asymmetric, closed-form, finite-parameter multinomial choice models. We demonstrate our methods by developing four new asymmetric, multinomial choice models. Empirically, most of our models strongly dominate the multinomial logit (MNL) model in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample log-likelihoods. Moreover, analyzing two policy applications, we find practical differences between the MNL and our new asymmetric models. Our results suggest that while asymmetric models may not always outperform symmetric ones, asymmetric choice models are worth testing because they might have better statistical performance and entail substantively different policy and financial implications when compared with traditional symmetric models, such as the MNL.","[Brathwaite, Timothy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Brathwaite, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",timothyb0912@berkeley.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,,UCCONNECT; Caltrans [65A0529 TO 27],UCCONNECT; Caltrans,"We thank James A.

I analyze the institutions that drove the incentives for both, and show that they came together to produce the Great Enrichment. These incentives were both material and social: between 1500 and 1700, the search for financial security and reputation cooperated in producing a unique institutional environment in which the elites in Western Europe produced the three legged-stool of European modernity: the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under different gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty levels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic factor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six different indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary policy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of uncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe haven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be sensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and to whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a positive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty composite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under normal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio composed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.","[Bouoiyour, Jamal; Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, CATT, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",jamal.bouoiyour@univ-pau.fr; refk.selmi@univ-pau.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,"Jamal, Bouoiyour/0000-0003-1920-1155",,,,,41,73,77,4,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using the proposed estimator, we estimate a dynastic model and use the estimated model to conduct counterfactual simulations to investigate the role Nature versus Nurture in intergenerational mobility. We find that Nature accounts for 20 percent of the observed intergenerational immobility at the bottom of income distribution. That means that 80 percent of mobility at the bottom of the income distribution is explained by economic decision and economic/institutional constraints.","[Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Soytas, Mehmet A.] Ozyegin Univ, Grad Sch Business, Istanbul, Turkey",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Ozyegin University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",ggayle@wustl.edu; lgolan@wustl.edu; mehmet.soytas@ozyegin.edu.tr,"Soytas, Mehmet Ali/L-7687-2019","Soytas, Mehmet Ali/0000-0001-5839-6069",,,,,55,4,4,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The approach identifies the combinations of preferences over the sex and number of children that best explain observed childbearing. Empirical estimates indicate that a majority of parents in Africa, Asia, and the Americas consider the sex of children when making childbearing decisions. Many parents prefer sons and many prefer daughters. Comparisons with reported preferences suggest that survey respondents tend to underreport the degree to which they prefer sons or daughters. Estimates indicate that, although sex preferences are widespread, they have little effect on aggregate fertility levels.","[Norling, Johannes] Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Econ, 50 Coll St, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA",Mount Holyoke College,"Norling, J (通讯作者)，Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Econ, 50 Coll St, S Hadley, MA 01075 USA.",jnorling@mtholyoke.edu,,"Norling, Johannes/0000-0002-5696-2001",NICHD as part of the University of Michigan Population Studies Center training program [T32 HD007339]; NICHD Center Grant [R24 HD041028]; University of Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics,NICHD as part of the University of Michigan Population Studies Center training program; NICHD Center Grant; University of Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics,This work was supported by the NICHD (T32 HD007339) as part of the University of Michigan Population Studies Center training program.

Using a laboratory experiment, participants jointly produce a surplus using a real effort task with the entire surplus given to the person who put in higher effort. Participants then bargain over the surplus in a series of ultimatum games. Treatments varied whether the proposer or responder received the surplus prior to bargaining and the threat point of the responder. The results suggest that proposers respect prior ownership when the responder has a strong ability to punish, but not when punishment is weak. Responders respect prior ownership when their ability to punish is weak, but reject at high rates when they have strong punishment. An independent measure of individual sensitivity to rule following can explain some of the results, adding support to the theory that individual behavior in bargaining is driven in part by adherence to social norms.

Absent panel data, we construct synthetic panels using repeated cross sections of household expenditure surveys and subjective wellbeing surveys conducted during the 2000s and early 2010s. Objective welfare dynamics indicate mixed trends. About half of the poor in the 2000s moved out of poverty by the end of the decade, but chronic poverty remained high; upward mobility was strong in Syria and Tunisia, but downward mobility was pronounced in Yemen and Egypt. The analysis with subjective wellbeing data suggests negative developments in most countries during the Arab Spring transitions and provides evidence on the eroding middle-class consensus in Arab countries before and after the Arab Spring. Low education achievement, informal worker status, and rural residency are positively associated with lower chances for upward mobility and greater chances for downward mobility for both types of welfare measures.","[Dang, Hai-Anh H.] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dang, Hai-Anh H.] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecast, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, Chief Economists Off Latin Amer & Caribbean Reg, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecast, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hdang@worldbank.org; eianchovichina@worldbank.org,"Dang, Hai-Anh/AAW-5169-2021; Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021","Dang, Hai-Anh/0000-0003-4913-5291",UK Department of International Development,UK Department of International Development,"We would like to thank the editor Stephan Klasen, two anonymous reviewers, Ragui Assaad, Martijn Burger, Sami Bibi, Hadi Salehi Esfahani, Francisco Ferreira, Ravi Kanbur, Peter Lanjouw, Norman Loayza, and participants at a workshop for the MENA Inequality Report (Washington, DC), the IARIW-CAPMAS conference (Cairo, Egypt), DECRG Hub seminar (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and the NEUDC conference (MIT) for helpful discussions on earlier versions.

In this regard, we, first, estimate a dynamic factor model with time-varying loadings and stochastic volatility (DFM-TV-SV). Then, in the second step, we use a quantile-on-quantile (QQ) predictive regression model to capture the effect of EPU on the common factor and stochastic volatility derived from the DFM-TV-SV for the states and MSAs. Our results show that EPU has a significant negative effect on the common economic activity of both the states and MASs, and it also significantly increases the common volatility. However, the impact of uncertainty varies substantially depending on the initial states (quantiles) of both common output or volatility and EPU. Thus, our results tend to suggest that policy design should be state-dependent.","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Ma, Jun] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 301 Lake Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Risse, Marian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Northeastern University; Helmut Schmidt University; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; ju.ma@northeastern.edu; marian.risse@hsu-hh.de; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,"Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,90,64,66,0,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and the introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Restrepo, Pascual] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; pascual@bu.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,Bradley Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Toulouse Network on Information Technology,Bradley Foundation; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Working with a new dataset on issuance activity in domestic and international markets and firm performance, the paper finds that capital raising through these markets has grown rapidly since the early 1990s and involved an increasing number of firms. Whereas the amounts raised in equity and loan markets (relative to gross domestic product) stand well relative to international standards, bond issuance activity lags behind. However, bond financing has gained importance over time. Equity issuances take place primarily in domestic markets, whereas bonds and loans are mostly issued internationally, display long maturities and entail low levels of credit risk. Issuing firms from the Arab region are very large compared to international standards. They also tend to be larger, faster growing and more leveraged than non-issuing firms in Arab countries.","[Cortina, Juan J.; Ismail, Soha; Schmukler, Sergio L.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Schmukler, SL (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jcortinalorente@worldbank.org; sismail2@worldbank.org; sschmukler@worldbank.org,,,World Bank's Development Economics Department; Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); Middle East and North Africa Region; Economic Research Forum (ERF) in Egypt,World Bank's Development Economics Department; Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); Middle East and North Africa Region; Economic Research Forum (ERF) in Egypt,"We are grateful to Shanta Devarajan and Ibrahim Elbadawi for encouraging us to write the paper.

In some cases, intensity standards are associated with tradable credit markets to help reduce firms' compliance costs. I develop a jurisdictional model of credit trading under an intensity standard, framed in terms of a Renewable Portfolio Standard for electric utilities. I find that regulators of firms with low compliance costs always allow for inter jurisdictional credit trade. Regulators of firms with high costs of compliance allow for credit trade under the condition that extra-jurisdictional credits count less towards compliance compared to credits generated within the jurisdiction. Counter-intuitively, increasing the stringency of the intensity standard when credit trading is possible can have the opposite of the intended effect and actually decrease renewable electricity generation. Using numerical simulations, I show that heterogeneity in terms of renewable costs or externalities across jurisdictions are not sufficient for inter jurisdictional credit trading to be a stable equilibrium outcome.","[Rudik, Ivan] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 475J Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Rudik, I (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 475J Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",irudik@cornell.edu,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Control communities are provided with block grants to fund local public goods, while households in treatment communities are provided with vouchers that they may either contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for a private capital good.

In its basic version, a control group is untreated at two dates, whereas a treatment group becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of the treatment effect is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if the effect of the treatment is stable over time, and if the effect of the treatment is the same in the treatment and in the control group. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal. Finally, we use our results to reassess the returns to schooling in Indonesia.","[De Chaisemartin, C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [D'Haultfoeuille, X.] Ctr Res Econ & Stat, Stockholm, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"De Chaisemartin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,research grant Labex Ecodec: Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047],research grant Labex Ecodec: Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank Yannick Guyonvarch for outstanding research assistance, and are very grateful to Esther Duflo for sharing her data with us.

This allows the self interested policymakers to extract rents in the bailout process. In equilibrium, such a banking union can actually lower the welfare of citizens in the country receiving transfers compared to the autarky case, as the receiving country must increase its share of the overall burden of the bailout, in order to compensate for the rent-seeking distortion.

From an investment forecasting model that coherently analyzes firm- or group-specific effects of uncertainty, we find that the direction and the size of investment adjustment vary considerably across firms, with a significant but small negative average impact.

We evaluate the performance of inflation forecasts based on the single-equation forecasting specification implied by the model, exploiting the spatial pattern of international linkages underpinning global inflation. We find that incorporating cross-country interactions yields significantly more accurate forecasts of local inflation for a diverse group of 14 advanced countries (including the U.S.) than either a simple autoregressive model or a standard closed-economy Phillips curve-based forecasting model. We argue that modeling the temporal dimension but not the cross-country spillovers of inflation does limit a model's explanatory power in-sample and its (pseudo) out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, we also show that global inflation (without domestic slack) often contributes the most to achieve the gains on forecasting accuracy observed during our sample period (1984:Q1-2015:Q1)-this observation, according to theory, is crucially related to the flattening of the Phillips curve during this time period of increased globalization.

We find both significant markups and significant concentration across most sectors. We compare computed markups and concentration with early estimates in South Africa and with other international benchmark countries. We then examine the market structure based on the concentration, firms size and entry and exit dynamics to rule out some potential explanations for relatively high markups.

However, because the nominally uninsured pay only a small share of their medical expenses, health insurance also provides substantial transfers to nonrecipient parties who would otherwise bear the costs of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured. The prevalence of uncompensated care helps explain the limited take-up of heavily subsidized public health insurance and the evidence that many recipients value formal health insurance at substantially less than the cost to insurers of providing that coverage. The distributional implications of public subsidies for health insurance depend critically on the ultimate economic incidence of the transfers that they deliver to providers of uncompensated care.","[Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mahoney, Neale] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago; Northwestern University,"Finkelstein, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",afink@mit.edu,,,,,,,102,22,33,11,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Standard IV methods produce estimates of causal effects that are specific to individuals whose behavior can be manipulated by the instrument at hand. In many cases, these individuals are not the same as those who would be induced to treatment by an intervention or policy of interest to the researcher. The average causal effect for the two groups can differ significantly if the effect of the treatment varies systematically with unobserved factors that are correlated with treatment choice. We review the implications of this type of unobserved heterogeneity for the interpretation of standard IV methods and for their relevance to policy evaluation. We argue that making inferences about policy-relevant parameters typically requires extrapolating from the individuals affected by the instrument to the individuals who would be induced to treatment by the policy under consideration. We discuss a variety of alternatives to standard IV methods that can be used to rigorously perform this extrapolation. We show that many of these approaches can be nested as special cases of a general framework that embraces the possibility of partial identification.","[Mogstad, Magne; Torgovitsky, Alexander] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, N-0177 Oslo, Norway; [Mogstad, Magne] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; Statistics Norway; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, N-0177 Oslo, Norway.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com,,,,,,,104,27,31,3,14,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

It has been extraordinary in its social cost and its cost to European taxpayers. The causes of this failure are multiple. The main burden lies with consecutive Greek governments that did not carry out the necessary fiscal adjustment and reforms. In their lack of urgency they were strongly supported by American economists, especially Paul Krugman, who opposed austerity and instead called for fiscal stimulus, ignoring the need for financial stability. Much of this discussion was devoted to the benefits or harm of the Eurozone, which eventually hardly mattered. The crisis resolution was complicated by the European Union wanting to play a big role but not knowing how and weakening the traditional role of the International Monetary Fund. The key lessons are back to basics: A government needs to act hard and fast to resolve a severe financial crisis. The IMF is the best leader for financial stabilization. Early and fast fiscal adjustment brings about early financial stabilization, more structural reforms and early and higher growth.","[Aslund, Anders] Atlantic Council, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Åslund, A (通讯作者)，Atlantic Council, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",aaslund@atlanticcouncil.org,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We find that new goods trade increased disproportionately after the FTAs came into effect, and that least-traded goods (LTG)those accounting for the lowest 10% of trade prior to the FTAsended up accounting for 37% of post-FTA trade with FTA partners. In contrast, the corresponding share for a comparable group of countries that did not sign FTAs with Korea was only half as large, averaging close to 20%. We also find that only less than 2% of all least-traded products accounted for most of the growth in LTG trade, and that those goods tended to be clustered in the same industries as the intensively-traded goods. Furthermore, a larger fraction of LTG became heavily traded for the case of FTA partners than for non-FTA countries. Finally, we find evidence that least-traded imports were subject to higher pre-FTA tariff protection than other products.","[Cho, Sang-wook (Stanley)] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Choi, Hansoo] Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si, South Korea; [Diaz, Julian P.] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, Quinlan Sch Business, 820 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Loyola University Chicago,"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, 336 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si, South Korea.",s.cho@unsw.edu.au; choihs@kipf.re.kr; jdiaz17@luc.edu,"Cho, Sang-Wook/AAS-3855-2020; Diaz, Julian P./O-7641-2017","Cho, Sang-Wook/0000-0002-8435-9322; Diaz, Julian P./0000-0003-0058-7086",,,,,21,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

A welfare analysis for teacher attendance in Ugandan primary schools,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Performance pay; Monitoring; Campbell's law; Field experiment; Education; Welfare; Uganda,CONSEQUENCES; IMPACTS; ABSENCE,"To achieve the twin objectives of incentivizing agent performance and providing information for planning purposes, public sector organizations often rely on reports by local monitors that are costly to verify. Received wisdom has it that attaching financial incentives to these reports will result in collusion, and undermine both objectives. Simple bargaining logic, however, suggests the reverse: pay for locally monitored performance could incentivize desired behavior and improve information. To investigate this issue, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in Ugandan primary schools that explored how incentives for teachers could be designed when based on local monitoring by head teachers. Our experiment randomly varied whether head teachers' reports of teacher attendance were tied to teacher bonus payments or not. We find that local monitoring on its own is ineffective at improving teacher attendance. However, combining local monitoring with financial incentives leads to both an increase in teacher attendance (by 8 percentage points) and an improvement in the quality of information. We also observe substantial gains in pupil attainment, driven primarily by a reduction in dropouts. By placing a financial value on these enrollment gains, we demonstrate that pay for locally monitored performance passes both welfare and fiscal sustainability tests.

The unpredictability of conventional fuel markets makes the revenues and costs associated with biofuel production uncertain. In addition, policy uncertainty, in the form of annual revisions and adjustments to the program, make the cost of complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard uncertain. This paper is the first to decompose the aggregate uncertainty facing biofuel producers and isolate the effect of fuel market uncertainty and policy uncertainty on the decision to enter and exit the biofuel market. Results indicate that the uncertainty in the conventional fuel markets and the uncertainty in status of the Renewable Fuel Standard program influence incentives to enter and exit the biofuel market in different ways. Annual adjustments to the standard coupled with the unpredictable expiration and reinstatement of blender tax credits can work to discourage investment in biofuels and undermine effectiveness of the program.

Factor analysis of responses from nearly 2000 participants across three studies is used to create and validate a multidimensional scale consisting of five distinct components of market attitudes. We assert that understanding within-subject variation in attitudes towards markets better informs analyses that relate market attitudes with economic behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies the adjustment dynamics of the real exchange rate towards its long-run equilibrium and presents empirical evidence that capital controls increase the persistence of misalignments. Allowing the speed of adjustment to vary according to the intensity of restrictions on capital flows, it is shown that the real exchange rate converges to its long-run level at significantly slower rates in countries with capital controls. This result is stronger when the exchange rate is undervalued and is independent of confounding factors such as the exchange rate regime and other forms of heterogeneity affecting the speed of adjustment. I also find evidence that controls on capital inflows have greater effects than controls on outflows. In addition, while the combination of capital controls with a fixed or managed exchange rate regime significantly increases the persistence of misalignments, controls appear to loose traction under more flexible exchange rate arrangements.

Comparing migrants' heights to the height distributions of their birth cohorts in their provinces of origin produces a measure of selection that is exogenous to migration, representative, and generated by almost unrestricted migration. The Italian migration was negatively selected at the national level, but positively selected at the local level. Selection varied systematically within Italy, with more positive local selection from shorter and poorer provinces. Selection was more negative among individuals with stronger connections in the United States and became more positive after imposition of the literacy test in 1917.

To identify causal effects, we exploit variation due to regulatory and technological constraints, which gives rise to a discontinuity in connectedness between cities at a distance of 6,000 miles. We show that improving an airport's position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, the results suggest that increasing interconnectedness induces links between businesses and generates economic activity at the local level but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally.","[Campante, Filipe] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Campante, Filipe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Zurich,"Campante, F (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,,,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard; Harvard Kennedy School Dean's Research Fund; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard; Harvard Kennedy School Dean's Research Fund; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,"We thank the editor, Pol Antras, and five anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

However, specifically in energy systems optimization models, heterogeneity of consumer preferences for competing energy technologies (e.g., vehicles), has not been adequately represented, leading to behaviorally unrealistic modeling results. This can lead to policy analysis results that are viewed by stakeholders as clearly deficient. This paper shows how heterogeneous consumer behavioral effects can be introduced into these models in the form of perceived disutility costs, to more realistically capture consumer choice in making technology purchase decisions. We developed a novel methodology that incorporates the theory of a classic consumer choice model into a commonly used long-term energy systems modeling framework using a case study of light-duty vehicles. A diverse set of consumer segments (thirty-six) is created to represent observable, identifiable differences in factors such as annual driving distances and attitude towards risks of new technology. Non-monetary or disutility costs associated with these factors are introduced to capture the differences in preferences across consumer segments for various technologies. We also create clones within each consumer segment to capture randomly distributed unobservable differences in preferences. We provide and review results for a specific example that includes external factors such as recharging/refueling station availability, battery size of electric vehicles, recharging time and perceived technology risks. Although the example is for light-duty vehicles in the US using a specific modeling system, this approach can be implemented more broadly to model the adoption of consumer technologies in other sectors or regions in similar energy systems modeling frameworks.

The first scenario is a standard wind power investment, where the investor rents the land from local farms. In the second scenario, the wind power investor buys the land and commercializes both electricity and crop production, thus reducing the revenue risk through the diversification. Both scenarios have a waiting option, with the wholesale prices leading the installation decision. We model the electricity price as a mean reverting process with jumps and with different jumping probabilities for the different seasons of the year. Corn prices follow a mean reverting process. The waiting flexibility was modeled as a bundle of European options. The results indicate that the waiting option is exercised in 100% of our simulations in both scenarios, suggesting the still important role of government policies to stimulate wind power. More importantly, in more than 90% of the simulations, the second scenario brought value to the investment. Furthermore, net present values are more sensitive to reductions in capital costs than electricity prices. These results can form the basis for more effective policies for the wind power sector.

In this paper we show, more generally, that these changes in wholesale/manufacturing prices can be offset and even dominated by adjustments in retail markups. Retailers have an incentive to charge the highest markups on the lowest-cost products and to adjust the markups on these products most actively. Thus, if the procurement costs of some foreign products rise, retailers will absorb these cost increases by raising prices relatively more on their relatively more efficient products, thereby mitigating the benefits of a protectionist tariff. We show that this effect can dominate the traditional substitution effect, which highlights the need to better understand the role of retailers in trade policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Living with higher-scoring peers raises students' GPAs, particularly for low-scoring students, and peer effects are stronger between socially proximate students. This shows that much of the treatment effect of tracking is attributable to peer effects. These results present a cautionary note about sorting students into academically homogeneous classrooms or neighborhoods.","[Garlick, Robert] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 419 Chapel Dr,213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Garlick, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 419 Chapel Dr,213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",rob.garlick@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,29,37,1,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

A first (integrated) model considers generation and transmission decisions as interdependent activities. A second model (disintegrated) assumes such expansion decisions as independent, such that the expansion of the network follows an exogenous process. This duality of approaches has been the subject of academic and public-policy discussion in various systems, as is the case of the German electricity system. The two models are simulated for the transmission network of Baja California Sur, which is a self-contained system with relatively few nodes and lines allowing a realistic study on the characteristics of efficient expansion within its electricity network. We demonstrate that the integrated network expansion approach results in higher levels of social welfare for different network topologies in this system.","[Guerrero, Daniel] Comis Reguladora Energia, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rosellon, Juan] German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Rosellon, Juan] Rice Univ, Ctr Energy Studies, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Rosellon, Juan] Univ Panamer, Ctr Regulac Energet & Econ Desarrollo, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

In addition to generalize many previous semi-and non-parametric specifications, LML is computationally very efficient due to a computationally-convenient likelihood equation that does not require computation of choice probabilities in iterative optimization. However, the original LML formulation assumes all utility parameters to be random. This study extends LML to a combination of fixed and random parameters (LML-FR), and motivates such combination in random parameter choice models in general. We further show that the likelihood of the LML-FR specification loses its special properties, leading to a much higher estimation time. In an empirical application about preferences for alternative fuel vehicles in China, estimation time increased by a factor of 20-40 when introducing fixed parameters. Despite losses in computation efficiency, we show that the flexibility of LML-FR is essential for retrieving eventual multimodality of mixing distributions.","[Bansal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Achtnicht, Martin] Dresden & Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Mannheim, Germany",Cornell University; Cornell University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung,"Bansal, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; daziano@cornell.edu; m.achtnicht@ioer.de,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1462289],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Award No. CMMI-1462289.

We observe that in the absence of regulatory institutions, there is less cooperation in groups with access to large resource pools than in groups with access to small resource pools. However, if regulatory institutions are present, we show that there is more cooperation in groups with access to large resource pools than in groups with access to small resource pools. Our findings also reveal that resource users are more willing to regulate access to abundant than to small resource pools.

In principle this allows different agents in the same player role to have different beliefs and play differently, and this is known to occur in laboratory experiments. To explore the impact of this heterogeneity, along with the idea that subjects use their information about other players' payoffs, we define rationalizable partition confirmed equilibrium (RPCE). We provide several examples to highlight the impact of heterogeneous beliefs, and show how mixed strategies can correspond to heterogeneous play in a large population. We also show that every heterogeneous-belief RPCE can be approximated by a RPCE in a model where every agent in a large pool is a separate player. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The seller knows the quality of his product, while the buyer does not. During bargaining, the seller may receive an outside option, the value of which depends on the quality of the product. If the outside option is sufficiently important, there is an equilibrium in which the buyer's belief about the product's quality stays constant and she continues to make the same randomized offer throughout the bargaining process. As a result, the equilibrium behavior produces an outcome path that resembles a bargaining deadlock and its resolution. The equilibrium outcome exhibits bargaining delay that does not vanish even with frequent offers, and the limiting delay may exist even without a static adverse selection problem. Under stronger parametric assumptions, the equilibrium with deadlock is the only one in which behavior is monotonic in the buyer's belief. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present paper draws on Justin Yifu Lin's framework of New Structural Economics to assess Ethiopia's industrial policies and engagement in the leather industry. Making use of two rounds of semi-structured interviews (2012 and 2015) with all of the foreign firms and more than a dozen local firms in the leather sector, as well as other key stakeholders, it examines seven steps the government took to build the industrial policy: Create a high-level focus on the sector; make strategic use of international development partners; attract a lead goose (Chinese) in the footwear sector; build government capacity to support the sector; strengthen business associations; shock-to-shape upgrading; improve input supply. Ultimately, while government interventions have led to improvements across several steps of the value chain, the paper identifies a number of factors that have prevented the country from fully realizing a latent comparative advantage in the leather sector.

We propose an analytical framework that encompasses several models of search for differentiated products, with a high-quality firm being more likely to offer a product that meets each consumer's need. An intermediary improves consumer search efficiency by providing a search platform on which positions are sold to high-quality firms through competitive bidding. While the intermediary may admit too many or too few firms to its platform, compared to what would maximize consumer surplus or total welfare, its presence can nevertheless benefit consumers and improve welfare. However, the intermediary may reduce search efficiency when firms are differentiated only horizontally, when they sell experience or credence goods, or when the intermediary is biased (possibly due to vertical integration).

To overcome selection in course taking, we exploit the timing of TA assignments, which occur after students enroll in a course, and use within class and within student variation in TA-student race composition. Focusing on an Asian vs. non-Asian split, results show a positive and significant increase in course grades when students are assigned TAs of a similar race/ethnicity. These effects are largest in classes where TAs were given advanced copies of exams and when exams were not multiple choice. We find positive racial correlations between students and TAs at office hours and discussion sections, suggesting student attendance responds to TA race. We also find some evidence of persistent effects: Racial match improves subsequent student performance in sequenced courses, and positively influences decisions on majoring and future course enrollment for Freshmen and Sophomores. Overall, our evidence is consistent with TA-student match quality gains and role model effects.","[Lusher, Lester] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Campbell, Doug] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; [Carrell, Scott] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carrell, Scott] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; New Economic School; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Carrell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Sheilds Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",secarrell@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,38,25,36,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Some of that criticism is warranted; but, in our view, much is not. This paper contributes to the debate over the adequacy of benchmark DSGE models by showing how three extensions, which are features that have characterized the global economy since the early 2000s, are necessary to improve our understanding of global shocks and policy insights. The three extensions are to acknowledge and model the entire global economy and the linkage through trade and capital flows; to allow for a wider range of relative price variability by moving to multiple-sector models rather than a single good model; and to allow for changes in risk perceptions which propagate through financial markets and adjustments in the real economy. These extensions add some complexity to large-scale macro-models, but without them policy models can oversimplify things, allowing misinterpretations of shocks and therefore costly policy mistakes to occur. Using over-simplified models to explain a complex world makes it more likely there will be 'puzzles'. The usefulness of these extensions is demonstrated in two ways: first, by briefly revisiting some historical shocks to show how outcomes can be interpreted that make sense within a more complex DSGE framework; then, by making a contemporary assessment of the implications from the proposed large fiscal stimulus and the bans on immigration by the Trump administration which have both sectoral and macroeconomic implications that interact.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.; Stoeckel, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Australian National University; Brookings Institution,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au; abstoeckel@gmail.com,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",,,,,24,11,11,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

(2015). The model is estimated using quarterly data over the period 1970Q1-2015Q4. The results indicate that the relationship is quantile-dependent, which may reveal misleading results in studies using traditional analyses that address the averages. The Wald test confirms our findings by rejecting the null hypothesis of parameter constancy for both the Netherlands and Ireland. The changes in energy consumption are more responsive to past levels and past changes in globalization than the adjustment provided by the error-correction method (ECM). Interestingly, the findings indicate that globalization is positively correlated with energy consumption in the long-term for the two countries. Furthermore, globalization shares a robust long-term relationship with energy consumption. Energy consumption is strongly related to globalization in the long-term. However, the short-term effects of globalization on energy demand are limited for those countries. Important policy implications are then suggested based on the empirical results.

Our sample consists of male factory workers in a manufacturing facility in a Muslim country. In our between-subjects' design, each worker is asked to allocate an amount of money between himself and a stranger. Specifically, we examine behavior of observants and nonobservants before and after the daily break of the Ramadan fast. We also examine behavior outside of Ramadan, where we treat alimentary abstention as akin to a long fasting period. We hypothesize and confirm that outside Ramadan, decision makers who abstain from any alimentary intake transfer less money to recipients relative to decision makers who do not abstain. Strikingly, this effect is reversed during the month of Ramadan. Specifically, observant workers who are in the midst of their Ramadan fast are far more generous to recipients than workers who have had their evening meal. Interestingly, observant and nonobservant workers after the daily break of the Ramadan fast and workers outside Ramadan that consumed aliments make statistically similar transfers. Our findings suggest that it is the interaction between alimentary abstention and religious observance that amplifies prosocial behavior during Ramadan, where fasting is part of the ritual.","[Haruvy, Ernan E.] Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Ioannou, Christos A.] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Golshirazi, Farnoush] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Haruvy, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",eharuvy@utdallas.edu; christos.a.ioannou@gmail.com; farnoush.golshirazi@univ.ox.ac.uk,"Haruvy, Ernan/AAH-3467-2022; Haruvy, Ernan/AFM-0896-2022; Ioannou, Christos/AAN-8975-2020","Ioannou, Christos/0000-0001-7928-9158; Haruvy, Ernan/0000-0001-8077-1363",Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,"The paper has benefited greatly from the comments of Shai Danziger, Raymond O'Brien, Alexis Antoniades, Manos Mentzakis, Carmine Ornaghi, Miltos Makris, Abbas Zabihzadeh, Mohammad Reza Abedi, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Hamid Taher Neshat Doost, and Mohammad Ali Mazaheri.

We advance a theoretical explanation of our empirical findings.","[Chen, Kaiji] Emory Univ, Econ Dept, 1602 Fishburne Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Chen, Kaiji; Zha, Tao] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA; [Ren, Jue] Texas Christian Univ, Neeley Sch Business, Dept Finance, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Zha, Tao] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Zha, Tao] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Emory University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Texas Christian University; Emory University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chen, KJ (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Econ Dept, 1602 Fishburne Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;Chen, KJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",kaiji.chen@emory.edu; jue.ren@tcu.edu; zmail@tzha.net,,,"National Science Foundation through the NBER [SES 1558486]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633003, 71742004, 71473168]; Becker Friedman Institute",National Science Foundation through the NBER; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Becker Friedman Institute,"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Mark Aguiar, Coeditor.

These outcomes are compared to those which result from the behavior of selfish agents. A variant of Fehr-Schmidt preferences is employed that allows the externality from agents who are ahead to differ in magnitude from the externality from those who are behind in the income distribution. We find first, that inequality-averse preferences yield distributional outcomes that are analogous to tax-transfer schemes with selfish agents, and may either increase or decrease average consumption. Second, in a society of inequality-averse agents, a linear income tax can be welfare-enhancing. Third, inequality-averse preferences can lead to less redistribution at any given tax, with low-wage agents receiving smaller net subsidies and/or high-wage individuals paying less in net taxes. Finally, an inequality-averse median voter may prefer higher redistribution even if it means less utility from own consumption and leisure.","[Murray, Matthew N.; Santore, Rudy] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 505A, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Peng, Langchuan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nanjing Audit University,"Peng, LC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",mmurray1@utk.edu; langchaun-peng@126.com; rsantore@utk.edu,,"Peng, Langchuan/0000-0001-9253-2378",,,,,30,0,0,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

By human capital we mean an intangible asset, best thought of as a stock of embodied and disembodied knowledge comprising education, information, entrepreneurship, and productive and innovative skills, which is formed through investments in schooling, job training, and health as well as through research and development projects and informal knowledge transfers (cf. Ehrlich and Murphy 2007). The conjecture is that the ascendancy of the US as an economic superpower in the 20th century owes considerably to its faster human capital formation relative to that of the UK and 'old Europe.' This paper assesses whether the thesis has legs to stand on through both stylized facts and a supplementary quasi-experimental empirical analysis. The stylized facts indicate that the US led other major developed countries in schooling attainments per adult population member, beginning in the latter part of the 19th century and lasting throughout the 20th century, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The quasi-experimental analysis constitutes the first attempt to test the hypothesis that the US's ascendancy to a major economic power stems largely from the impact of the first Morrill Act of 1862, which launched the public higher education movement in the US through the establishment of land grant colleges and universities across the nation during the latter part of the 19th century. The higher education movement appears to have spearheaded a higher long-term rate of growth in per capita income in the US relative to the UK and other major European countries.","[Cook, Adam] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] IZA, Bonn, Germany",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Fredonia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Cook, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",cook@fredonia.edu,,"Cook, Adam/0000-0002-0064-1399",,,,,34,2,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

When the asset pledgeability is low, the down payment is high, and bubble investment is unleveraged, as in a standard rational bubble model. When the pledgeability is high, the down payment is low, making it easier for leveraged borrowers to invest in the bubbly asset. As loans are packaged together into a competitive pool, the pricing of individual default risk may facilitate risk-taking. In equilibrium, credit-constrained borrowers may optimally choose a risky leveraged investment strategy - borrow to invest in the bubbly asset and default if the bubble bursts. The model predicts joint boom-bust cycles in asset prices and securitized credit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a randomized trial in Uganda testing specialized packaging and messaging, designed to increase antimalarial adherence. We find that stickers with short, targeted messages on the packaging increase adherence by 9% and reduce untaken pills by 29%. However, the currently used method of boosting adherence through costly, specialized packaging with pictorial instructions had no significant impacts relative to the standard control package. We develop a theoretical framework of the adherence decision, highlighting the role of symptoms, beliefs about being cured, and beliefs about drug effectiveness to help interpret our results.

Until very recently, scholars using various datasets have shown that residents of post-communist countries were significantly less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts in non-transition countries (controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics). The literature has explained this finding by the great macroeconomic instability of the 1990s, by a substantial decrease in the quality and accessibility of public goods, by the major increase in inequality, and by the rapid depreciation of pre-transition human capital. All these factors were expected to subside over time at least after the post-Great-Recession recovery. In this paper, we consider two most recent datasets the third wave of the Life in Transition Survey (administered in 2015-16) and the 2010-2016 waves of the annual Gallup World Poll. We find that by 2016 the transition happiness gap had closed. This convergence has taken place both due to a happiness recovery in post-communist countries after the Great Recession and due to a decrease in life satisfaction in comparator countries in recent years. We also find that the convergence in life satisfaction was primarily driven by middle-income young, educated individuals, regardless of gender.","[Guriev, Sergei] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Guriev, Sergei] CEPR, London, England; [Melnikov, Nikita] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",sergei.guriev@sciencespo.fr,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169",,,,,12,20,21,0,17,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

We analyze an experiment in which we randomly give middle school math teachers access to existing high-quality, off-the-shelf lessons, and in some cases, support to promote their use. Teachers receiving access alone increased students' math achievement by a marginally significant 0.06 of a standard deviation. Teachers who received access and support increased students' math achievement by 0.09 of a standard deviation. Weaker teachers experience larger gains, suggesting that these lessons substitute for teacher skill or efforts. The online materials are more scalable and cost effective than most policies aimed at improving teacher quality, suggesting that, if search costs can be overcome, there is a real benefit to making high-quality instructional materials available to teachers on the Internet.

The lower growth rates characterizing the post Global Financial Crisis era and the concerns about income inequality put to the fore the degree that better targeted investment in human capital may ameliorate the challenges facing the working poor. Using cross-country data, we find the association between the income shares of the working poor, dependence on manufacturing sector, and the availability of vocational education. Conditioning on tertiary educational attainment, improved access to better vocational education will probably contribute more than large increase in regular college attainment. Comparing the US to Germany suggests that pushing more students to BA granting colleges may no longer be the most efficient way to deal with the challenges caused by the decline in manufacturing employment affecting in particular lower-income households. We also note that a tracking of technical training and educational budget, shown in the case of Vietnam in comparison to Thailand, as well as government subsidies for reskilling of labour fource throughout their career in Singapore, is a potential explanation for their relative manufacturing competitiveness.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Jinjarak, Yothin; Ngo, Nam; Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Victoria University Wellington,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.;Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",aizenman@usc.edu,"Jinjarak, Yothin/F-2746-2010","Jinjarak, Yothin/0000-0001-5262-3718; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,30,8,9,4,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This article provides a systematic review of the published literature to date on infant health production and how it has evolved over the past 3-4 decades as data have become more available, computing has improved, and econometric methods have become more sophisticated. While empirical research in most fields has expanded in corresponding ways, the infant health production research has become an important part of the broader and inherently multidisciplinary literature on intergenerational health. The strongest and most robust findings are that policies matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care, and that prenatal smoking and other chemical exposures substantially compromise infant health. Promising directions for future research include elucidating relevant pathways, reconciling the largely inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition and education, and exploring the roles of preconceptional and lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity and substitutability of inputs, factors that modify effects of inputs, and evolving medical technologies.","[Corman, Hope] Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Corman, Hope; Dave, Dhaval] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA USA; [Reichman, Nancy E.] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rider University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bentley University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences,"Corman, H (通讯作者)，Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.;Corman, H (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",corman@rider.edu; ddave@bentley.edu; reichmne@rwjms.rutgers.edu,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University [67038, 74260]","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University","First and foremost, this article was a labor of love for our mentor, life coach, and friend, Michael Grossman.

We interpret this evidence through the lens of an equilibrium life-cycle, span-of-control model where managers invest in their skills. We use the model to quantify the importance of exogenous productivity differences and the size-dependent distortions emphasized in the misallocation literature. Our findings indicate that such distortions are critical to generate the observed differences in the growth of relative managerial earnings across countries. Distortions that halve the growth of relative managerial earnings, a move from the U.S. to Italy in our data, lead to a reduction in managerial quality of 27% and to a reduction in output of about nearly 7% - more than half of the observed gap between the U.S. and Italy.

Since much of the corruption literature is plagued either by the lack of instruments or weak instruments, this paper makes a methodological contribution by drawing inferences based on Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio approach. We provide robust evidence that women's presence in parliament has a causal and negative impact on corruption while other measures of female participation in economic activities are shown to have no effect. Further, this negative relationship between women's presence in government and corruption is also found to hold in a regional analysis of 17 European countries alleviating concerns that the relationship is driven by unobservable country-fixed characteristics. Finally, we show that this relationship does not disappear when women gain similarity in social status. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain a set of new partial identification results for both the average treatment response and the average treatment effect. In particular, we find that the monotone treatment response and monotone treatment selection bound of Manski and Pepper, 2000 can be further tightened if we impose the smoothness conditions on the treatment response. Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper, 2000 and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","[Kim, Wooyoung] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kwon, Koohyun; Kwon, Soonwoo] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, Inst Fiscal Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Yale University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wkim68@wisc.edu; koohyun.kwon@yale.edu; soonwoo.kwon@yale.edu; sl3841@columbia.edu,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733",European Research Council [ERC-2014-CoG-646917-ROMIA]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041],"European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We would like to thank the Editor, Rosa Matzkin, three anonymous referees, Steve Bond, Andrew Chesher, Toru Kitagawa, Charles Manski, Adam Rosen, Kyungchul Song, and Elie Tamer for helpful comments.

We instruct subjects that the rule is to take the costly action. Their willingness to incur such a cost reveals respect for norms. We show that choices in this task are similar across five countries.

I also estimate effects among children whose older siblings received treatment directly; in this subpopulation, cognition effects are nearly twice as large.","[Ozier, Owen] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, MSN MC3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Ozier, O (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, MSN MC3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",oozier@worldbank.org,,,UC Berkeley (IBER); UC Berkeley (CEGA); UC Berkeley (Fernald Lab); UC Berkeley (CEG); UC Berkeley (John Carter Endowment); UC Berkeley (Rocca Fellowship); UC Berkeley (BBB); UC Berkeley (Henry Wheeler Center); USAID; PCD; WUSTL Olin Business School CRES,UC Berkeley (IBER); UC Berkeley (CEGA); UC Berkeley (Fernald Lab); UC Berkeley (CEG); UC Berkeley (John Carter Endowment); UC Berkeley (Rocca Fellowship); UC Berkeley (BBB); UC Berkeley (Henry Wheeler Center); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); PCD; WUSTL Olin Business School CRES,"Research supported by UC Berkeley (IBER, CEGA, Fernald Lab, CEG, John Carter Endowment, Rocca Fellowship, BBB, and Henry Wheeler Center), USAID, PCD, and WUSTL Olin Business School CRES.

This paper argues that digital-industrial innovations make human capital more important than ever and the focus needs to shift to the complementarity between new technologies and human abilities. In particular, more effort should be devoted to (i) understanding what new skills will be needed, and how existing jobs will change; (ii) upgrading education and professional training schemes; (iii) reforming labor market institutions to support a future where a larger share of workers will change jobs and employers more frequently; (iv) reforming social benefits systems and bolstering social safety nets to smooth the economic transition and cushion the impact on the worst-affected workers. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges, addresses the key areas of action, and puts forward specific proposals, including policy actions, industry initiatives, and further research projects. The authors argue that the G20 could and should champion a comprehensive approach to leverage digital-industrial innovations for faster job creation and growth, with initiatives to re-align demand and supply of skills, labor market reforms, redesigned social safety nets, measures to promote digital innovation and facilitate the adoption of skills-augmenting technologies, and strengthened private sector training programs.","[Annunziata, Marco] Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA; [Bourgeois, Hendrik] Cargill, Wayzata, MN USA",Cargill,"Annunziata, M (通讯作者)，Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA.",annunziata.sf@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,57,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 28,2018,12,,,,,,,,201842,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-42,0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0FB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436639400001,0

LML represents the mixing distribution of a logit kernel as a sieve function (polynomials, step functions, and splines, among many other variants). In the first part of this paper, we conduct Monte-Carlo studies to analyze the number of required parameters (e.g., polynomial order) in three LML variants to recover the true population distributions, and also compare the performance (in terms of accuracy, precision, estimation time, and model fit) of LML and a mixed multinomial logit with normal heterogeneity (MMNL-N). Our results indicate that adding too many parameters in LML may not be the best strategy to retrieve underlying taste heterogeneity; in fact, over-specified models generally perform worst in terms of BIC. We recommend to use neither minimum-BIC nor the most flexible specification, but we rather suggest to start with the same number of parameters as a parametric model (such as MMNL-N) while checking changes in the derived histogram of the mixing distribution. As expected, LML was able to recover bimodal-normal, lognormal, and uniform distributions much better than the misspecified MMNL-N. Computational efficiency makes LML advantageous in the process of searching for the final specification. In the second part of the paper, we estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates of German consumers for different vehicle attributes when making alternative-fuel-car purchase choices. LML was able to capture the bimodal nature of WTP for vehicle attributes, which was not possible to retrieve using standard parametric specifications.","[Bansal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Achtnicht, Martin] Dresden & Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Mannheim, Germany",Cornell University; Cornell University; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bansal, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; daziano@cornell.edu; m.achtnicht@ioer.de,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1462289],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Award No. CMMI-1462289.

In presence of financial extreme dependence, the distributions of residual and recurrence times are not the same. We examine the equality of two distributions using the permutation test. In comparison to other methods in multivariate extreme value theory, our proposed method does not need the i.i.d. assumption. Our method can handle the situation where the extremes for different components do not occur at the same time.

In this paper we develop a multi-regime global VAR model to study the spillover effects in financial markets, in goods markets and between financial markets and goods markets across countries, which are assumed to be either in a high financial stress regime or in a low financial stress regime. It turns out that in both the high and the low stress regimes financial shocks to a country, big or small one, can have large and persistent impacts on financial markets of other countries, and only in the high stress regime financial shocks to a country can have some negative output effects on other countries. In the high stress regime output shocks of a big country can have larger effects on financial conditions than those of a small country, while in the low stress regime output shocks of a country, big or small, have little impact on financial conditions.

While these suggestions have strong advantages, they also potentially increase the financial costs associated with data collection and, as a result, hamper the growth of experimental economics and limit the questions that may be addressed using experimental methods. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of extra credit as a reward medium as it is financially less taxing and readily available to most researchers as an alternative. We focus on experimental asset markets because data is particularly costly to collect for these experiments, e.g., a market consisting of 8-12 traders interacting over 15 trading periods is an independent observation. Our treatment variable is the reward medium, either extra credit or cash. We compare bubble measures in the two treatments and we find that bubbles observed in the extra-credit sessions are not significantly different from bubbles observed in the cash sessions. These results suggest that extra credit is an effective reward medium in experimental asset markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we investigate this hypothesis using a dynamic model of political economy. As well as formalizing this argument, our model demonstrates its limits, elucidating a robust theoretical force making democracy less stable in societies with high social mobility: when the median voter expects to move up (respectively down), she would prefer to give less voice to poorer (respectively richer) social groups. Our theoretical analysis shows that in the presence of social mobility, the political preferences of an individual depend on the potentially conflicting preferences of her future selves, and that the evolution of institutions is determined through the implicit interaction between occupants of the same social niche at different points in time.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014; Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951","Army Research Office, ARO MURI [W911NF-12-1-0509]; Carnegie Foundation","Army Research Office, ARO MURI(MURI); Carnegie Foundation","Acemoglu gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Army Research Office, ARO MURI W911NF-12-1-0509, and the Carnegie Foundation.",,47,25,27,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Positive productivity gains are often attributed to productivity spillovers; however, an alternative, much less emphasized channel is selection and market reallocation., whereby competition leads to factor and revenue reallocation within and between domestic firms and exits of the least productive firms. We investigate the roles of these different mechanisms in determining aggregate-productivity gains using a unifying framework that explores the mechanisms' distinct predictions on the distributions of domestic firms: within-firm productivity improvement shifts rightward or reshapes the productivity distribution, while selection and market reallocation move the revenue and employment distributions leftward and raise left truncations. Using a rich cross-country firm-level panel dataset, we find significant evidence of both mechanisms and effects of competition in product, technology, and labor space. However, selection and market reallocation account for the majority of aggregate-productivity gains, suggesting ignoring this channel could lead to substantial bias in understanding-the nature of productivity gains from multinational production.","[Alfaro, Laura] Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA; [Alfaro, Laura] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chen, Maggie X.] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St 367 NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; George Washington University,"Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA.;Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lalfaro@hbs.edu; xchen@gwu.edu,,,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,"We are very grateful to four anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions.

In fact, no study has analysed the differences between these variables according to business models. The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between quality, value, satisfaction and the future intentions of clients of public and private low-cost fitness centres and their differences. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1805 fitness centre clients. A confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group analysis was performed to test the difference between two invariance models. The findings indicate a greater weight in facilities and employees of the quality perceived from private low-cost fitness centres and a greater weight in programmes from public fitness centres. Furthermore, the relationship between the variables' overall quality, perceived value, satisfaction and future intentions had a greater influence in private low-cost fitness centres than in public centres.","[Garcia-Fernandez, Jeronimo; Fernandez-Gavira, Jesus] Univ Seville, Phys Educ & Sport Dept, Seville, Spain; [Galvez-Ruiz, Pablo] Int Univ La Rioja, Internet Learning Dept, Logrono, Spain; [Velez-Colon, Luisa] Interamer Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Educ, San Juan, PR USA; [Ortega-Gutierrez, Jaime] Univ Seville, Business Adm & Market Res & Mkt, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR); Inter American University of Puerto Rico-San German; University of Sevilla,"García-Fernández, J (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Phys Educ & Sport Dept, Seville, Spain.",jeronimo@us.es,"Gálvez-Ruiz, Pablo/T-1752-2017; García-Fernández, Jerónimo/V-4709-2018; Ortega-Gutierrez, Jaime/E-4994-2017; García-Fernández, Jerónimo/ACZ-1763-2022","Gálvez-Ruiz, Pablo/0000-0002-7659-1113; García-Fernández, Jerónimo/0000-0001-6574-9758;",,,,,61,46,47,3,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

It is well known that fictitious play fails to be Hannan consistent. Several variants of fictitious play including regret matching, generalized regret matching and smooth fictitious play, are known to be Hannan consistent. In this note, we consider sampled fictitious play: at each round, the player samples past times and plays the best response to previous moves of other players at the sampled time points. We show that sampled fictitious play, using Bernoulli sampling, is Hannan consistent. Unlike several existing Hannan consistency proofs that rely on concentration of measure results, ours instead uses anti-concentration results from Littlewood-Offord theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We show this pattern is most pronounced in social transfers which are also a large component of total government expenditures (28-39%). The discrepancy in the cyclicality of spending on goods and services is smaller, by contrast, and the category accounts for just 11-16% of total government expenditures. In a small open economy model, we find disparate social transfer policies can account for about half of the larger cyclical volatility of consumption relative to output in emerging economies compared to developed.

At each date, agents decide whether to vote to adopt one of two alternatives or continue to collect more information. The process stops when a qualified majority vote for an alternative. Three main insights emerge from our analysis and are consistent with an array of stylized facts regarding committee decision making. First, majority rule is more vulnerable than super-majority rules to the disproportionate influence of impatient committee members. Second, more diverse preferences, more patient members, or more unanimous decision voting rules lead to lengthier deliberation and more accurate decisions. Finally, balanced committees unanimously prefer to delegate deliberation power to a moderate chairman rather than be governed by a rule such as unanimity.","[Chan, Jimmy] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lizzeri, Alessandro] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Suen, Wing] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yariv, Leeat] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Fudan University; New York University; University of Hong Kong; California Institute of Technology,"Chan, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"Suen, Chuen/A-1091-2010",,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1158]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171125]; National Science Foundation [SES 0551014]; Shanghai Dongfang Xuezhe Program; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [HKU753911],Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Shanghai Dongfang Xuezhe Program; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This article is the result of a consolidation of 'Does Majority Rule Produce Hasty Decisions?' by Chan and Suen, and 'Sequential Deliberation' by Lizzeri andYariv.

We build a fully-fledged heterogeneous-agent model with an endogenous financial market of private credit and debt to rationalize these stylized facts. We show how financial development that promotes better credit allocations under more relaxed borrowing constraints can reduce the impact of non-financial shocks (such as TFP shocks, government spending shocks, preference shocks) on aggregate output and investment, and why this volatility-reducing effect diminishes with continuing financial liberalizations.

Our results highlight the flexibility of semiparametric approaches as we find parametric approaches are too restrictive in estimating marginal productivity.

The dynamic generalized method-of-moments (GMM) results indicate that institutions play an important role in mediating the positive relationship between banking sector development and growth. This suggests that the marginal impact of financial development on growth depends on institutional quality. Using the four-way partition of institutions classified by Rodrik (2005), we also find that resilient market-regulating, market-stabilizing, and market-creating institutions act as mediators to the financial market in facilitating growth.

Instead of a comprehensive approach, we focus on three elements. First, we study beliefs and values about the economic system present in Peron's speeches during the period 1943-55. Second, given that these beliefs are non-standard (for economists), we present two models formalizing some of the key aspects (for example, the idea that there is something more than a material exchange in labor relations). Third, we study survey data for the 1990s on the beliefs of Peronist and non-Peronist voters in Argentina and Democrat and Republican voters in the US. While income and education suggest that Peronists (in relative terms) look like the Democrats, their beliefs and values suggest that Peronists are the Argentine equivalent of the Republicans.","[Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Di Tella, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dubra, Juan] Univ Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad de Montevideo,"Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rditella@hbs.edu,"Dubra, Juan/Q-2846-2019",,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)),"We thank Esteban Aranda for suggestions and exceptional research assistance, and Andres Velasco for introducing us to Acario Cotapos.

We introduce a theoretical link from imperfect information about WCR to firms' performance. Firms choose non-prepaid factors of production with uncertainty about required prepayments, where their access to credit is constrained by collateral. After realization, firms with higher WCR may face financial constraints. This uncertainty influences their demand for inputs, albeit risk-neutrality. Unable to employ the projected level of prepaid input, constrained firms encounter capacity underutilization, leading to misallocation of factors. Aggregate productivity and output, will thus be deteriorated during credit contraction due to higher inefficiency. Empirical assessment of our findings, using the Annual Survey of Iranian Manufacturing Enterprises, shows that higher requirement for working capital tightens firms' hired prepaid inputs, production, and capacity utilization. Furthermore, firms with more uncertain working capital will choose a lower level of production. These results are especially scaled up, when firms face financial constraints.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the supply- and demand-driven sources of this home market advantage. While trade costs, foreign production costs, and taste heterogeneity all matter for market outcomes, we find that a preference for home brands is the single most important driver of home market advantage even after controlling for brand histories and dealer networks. Furthermore, we also find that consumers favor domestically producing brands even if these brands originated from a foreign country. Therefore, our results suggest a novel demand effect of FDI: Establishing local production increases demand for the brand even in the absence of any cost savings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We extend a model from Buffa, Vayanos and Woolley (2014) by allowing general contracts, and by allowing the portfolio manager to invest privately in individual risky assets or the index. To alleviate the effect of moral hazard, Agent is optimally compensated by benchmarking to the index, which, however, may incentivize him to be too much of a closet indexer. To counter those incentives, the optimal contract rewards Agent for taking specific risk of individual assets in excess of the systematic risk of the index, by rewarding the deviation between the portfolio return and the return of an index portfolio, and the deviation's quadratic variation.

To answer this question, we propose a methodology to identify historical fiscal adjustment episodes for countries that both needed and wanted to adjust in order to stabilize debt to GDP. We identify 91 adjustment episodes in 49 countries during 1945-2014. We find that countries typically improved their cyclically adjusted primary balances by close to 5 percent of GDP. We also observe that countries make substantial efforts to stabilize debt, but ease their primary balances once this objective is achieved, without getting back to their initial lower debt-to-GDP ratio. Consolidations were larger when sustained over time and the initial deficit was high. Fiscal adjustments were also larger when accompanied by monetary easing and, to a lesser extent, by an improvement in credit conditions.","[Escolano, Julio] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Jaramillo, Laura] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Mulas-Granados, Carlos] Int Monetary Fund, European Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Mulas-Granados, C (通讯作者)，1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",CMulasGranados@imf.org,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

It introduces seven articles written by leading business anthropologists. Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. The central concern of anthropologists is the application of anthropological knowledge to the solution of human problems. This introductory article briefly summarizes the history of anthropology and business studies in Japan, Korea, and China, and examines the intertwined relationship of this branch of anthropology with the history of East Asian colonialism. The author then introduces anthropology's methodology and perspective that emphasize holistic, comparative, empirical, inductive, and ethno-historically oriented mode of inquiry. Anthropology regards the economic organization not only as an entity dealing with financial issues, but also as a cultural-emitter that operates in a nexus of multiple stakeholder-agencies. To study companies and economic activities in Asia anthropologically is to explore organizationally mediated, symbol-producing practices, schemes, actions, and consequences, that interact with politico-economic forces and institutional assemblage, both locally and globally. The author argues for combining the critical ethnography of Asian business on the ground, with the macro-level analyses of economic conditions and socio-political movements.","[Hamada, Tomoko] Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Hamada, T (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",thamad@wm.edu,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We first derive two different metrics for team quality, and then use those metrics to see how they impact attendance. We find that there is a positive interaction between the quality of the teams. Then various simulations are run to see how attendance would change under different scheduling scenarios. If teams are put into conferences based on the team quality measures, the average per game attendance only rises 1-2%. This is true if 1-year or 10-year quality measures are used. However, our simulation suggests that this effect would be more than offset, mainly because schools with larger capacity would play fewer home games and so aggregate attendance would fall. We discuss whether this effect would be mitigated by capacity adjustments in the longer term.","[Szymanski, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Winfree, Jason] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Szymanski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",stefansz@umich.edu; jwinfree@uidaho.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,31,8,9,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

The results suggest that both price competition and seller heterogeneity are key drivers of the observed price dispersion. The paper finds that sellers with large sales volume, newly established sellers and US mainland states-based sellers tend to price lower. The identified significant spatial interaction is evidence of spatial price competition. Controlling for everything else, a seller asks a lower price when large sellers charge relatively high prices, which is also evidence of price-based selling and undercutting.","[Wang, Haoying] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Management, Socorro, NM 87801 USA",New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology,"Wang, HY (通讯作者)，New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Management, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",halking.econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Using a minimum distance strategy, we find that international financial risk sharing is low even for advanced small open economies. Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents. However, vacancies and unemployment hardly respond whenever the real exchange rate channel is mute. These findings suggest the relevance of the open economy dimension for the transmission of demand type shocks to the labour market more generally.

Math and language exam scores constitute the key measures of cognitive skills; teacher-assigned grades the key measure of noncognitive skills. The data consist of two 9-year panels of youth completing compulsory education in Denmark. Estimation of completion proceeds separately by gender and VET type, controlling for selection and right censoring. The authors find that all skills are inversely related to VET enrollment, even controlling for family-specific effects. Estimates for completion vary considerably by program type, demonstrating the methodological importance of distinguishing among different VET courses. Math scores are positively related to certification for all VET tracks, though with very different magnitudes; language skills are inversely related for the nonbusiness tracks; and noncognitive skills appear important primarily for the business track.","[Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St,Box 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Stratton, Leslie S.] LCC, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gupta, Nabanita Datta] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4,Bldg 2621,Off B-05, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Reimer, David] Aarhus Univ, Danish Sch Educ, Jens Chr Skous Vej 4, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Holm, Anders] Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Sociol, Room 5327, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Virginia Commonwealth University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St,Box 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，LCC, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lsstratt@vcu.edu; ndg@econ.au.dk; dare@edu.au.dk; aholm@uwo.ca,"Holm, Anders/JBS-7378-2023; Datta Gupta, Nabanita/JXN-4176-2024","Datta Gupta, Nabanita/0000-0001-7904-445X; Reimer, David/0000-0002-8648-3829",Danish Strategic Research Council [2139-08-0020],Danish Strategic Research Council(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),"Thanks to Anders Trolle and James Stratton for research assistance and thanks to seminar participants at the 2015 Society of Labor Economists annual meeting, the 2014 EALE Conference in Ljubljana (especially Anders Stenberg), and the College of William & Mary.

Focusing on consumer under-reaction to not-fully-salient sales taxes, we show theoretically that the efficiency costs of taxation are amplified by differences in under-reaction across individuals and across tax rates. To empirically assess the importance of these issues, we implement an online shopping experiment in which 2,998 consumers purchase common household products, facing tax rates that vary in size and salience. We replicate prior findings that, on average, consumers under-react to non-salient sales taxes- consumers in our study react to existing sales taxes as if they were only 25% of their size. However, we find significant individual differences in this under-reaction, and accounting for this heterogeneity increases the efficiency cost of taxation estimates by at least 200%. Tripling existing sales tax rates nearly doubles consumers' attention to taxes, and accounting for this endogeneity increases efficiency cost estimates by 336%. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms and determinants of boundedly rational processing of not-fully-salient incentives, and our general approach provides a framework for robust behavioural welfare analysis.","[Taubinsky, Dmitry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Taubinsky, Dmitry; Rees-Jones, Alex] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rees-Jones, Alex] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Taubinsky, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Taubinsky, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Taubinsky, Dmitry/0009-0007-6117-7415",Lab for Economic Applications and Policy (LEAP); Pension Research Council/Boettner Center for Pension and Retirement Research; Russell Sage Foundation; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,Lab for Economic Applications and Policy (LEAP); Pension Research Council/Boettner Center for Pension and Retirement Research; Russell Sage Foundation; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,"For helpful comments and suggestions, we thank Hunt Allcott, Eduardo Azevedo, Doug Bernheim, Raj Chetty, Stefano DellaVigna, Sarah Beate Eichmeyer, Emmanuel Farhi, Xavier Gabaix, Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, Shachar Kariv, Supreet Kaur, Judd Kessler, David Laibson, Erzo F.P.

A planner is in charge of selecting steps and distributing the accumulated aggregate values among a number of agents. We model this process by a directed network, whereby each edge is associated with a vector of individual values. This model applies to several new and existing problems, e.g. developing a connected public facility and distributing total values received by surrounding districts, selecting a long-term production project and sharing final profits among partners of a firm, or choosing a machine schedule to serve different tasks and distributing total benefits among task owners. Herein, we provide the first axiomatic study on path selection and value-sharing in networks. We consider four sets of axioms from different perspectives, including those related to (1) the sequential consistency of value-sharing; (2) the monotonicity of value-sharing with respect to technology improvements; (3) the independence of value-sharing with respect to certain network transformations; and (4) the robust implementation of the efficient path selection when the planner has no information about network configuration. Surprisingly, these four disparate sets of axioms characterize similar classes of solutions, namely selecting an efficient path(s) and assigning to each agent a share of total values that is independent of individual values. Furthermore, we characterize more general solutions that depend on individual values. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, quantitative easing (QE), in which central banks expand their balance sheet to lower long-term interest rates, may complement policy approaches focused on adjustments in short-term interest rates. Simulation results using a large-scale model (FRB/US) suggest that QE does not improve economic performance if the steady-state interest rate is high, confirming that such policies were not advantageous from 1960 to 2007. However, QE can offset a significant portion of the adverse effects of the ELB when the equilibrium real interest rate is low. These improvements in economic performance exceed those associated with moderate increases in the inflation target. Active QE is primarily required when nominal interest rates are near the ELB, pointing to benefits within the model from QE as a secondary tool while relying on short-term interest rates as the primary tool.","[Kiley, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Kiley, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",,"Kiley, Michael T/H-1132-2012","Kiley, Michael/0000-0003-0427-0131",,,,,59,14,16,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

When workers are rationed out of the formal segment of the labor market against their will, i.e., the labor market is segmented, their quality of life is limited, and their wellbeing is reduced. When they can freely choose between a formal or informal employment relationship, i.e., the labor market is integrated, their wellbeing can reach high levels even in the presence of informal employment. We, therefore, test whether the Ukrainian labor market is segmented along the formal-informal divide, slicing the data by gender and age. The analysis that we perform consist in the analysis of short-term and medium-term transitions between five employment states, unemployment and inactivity. We also analyze wage gaps of mean hourly earnings and across the entire hourly earnings distribution, controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. According to our results segmentation is present for dependent employees: for a large part of informal employees informal employment is used as a waiting stage to enter formal salaried employment and is not voluntarily chosen. As far as self-employment is concerned the evidence is mixed regarding segmentation in the Ukrainian labor market. This heterogeneity in outcomes implies that not all informal work is associated with a low quality of life and reduced wellbeing in post-transition economies.","[Lehmann, Hartmut] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Pignatti, Norberto] Tbilisi State Univ, Int Sch Econ, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Lehmann, Hartmut; Pignatti, Norberto] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pignatti, Norberto] Univ Chicago, HCEO, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lehmann, Hartmut] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",University of Bologna; Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.;Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Lehmann, H (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",hartmut.lehmann@unibo.it,,"Pignatti, Norberto/0000-0002-2807-3178",,,,,29,6,6,1,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Increases in the size of the exchange network select for higher-fixed-cost exchange institutions, beginning with autarky, through various intermediate stages, and finally to mass monetary exchange. By identifying the relevant fixed costs of money and its institutional substitutes across time, the paper both accounts for the persistence of pre-monetary exchange institutions, despite the inevitability' of monetary exchange that seems to be a feature of traditional models of the origin of money, and illuminates the forces driving the transition from one to another.","[Harwick, Cameron] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Harwick, C (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",charwick@gmu.edu,,"Harwick, Cameron/0000-0003-2703-1627",Institute for Humane Studies,Institute for Humane Studies,"I am indebted to a large number of people for comments and suggestions on this paper, including (but certainly not limited to) Roger Koppl, Jason Potts, Mark Koyama, the participants at the Institutional and Organizational Economics Academy, and three anonymous reviewers.

A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence both cross-sectional and serial in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs struggle to reach the poorest, out-of-school children, men and the elderly. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: salt fortified with iron and iodine (DFS). We conduct a large-scale experiment in 400 villages in Bihar to test the impacts of both selling DFS and giving it away for free. At baseline, 45% of the sample is anemic. In 200 randomly assigned villages, we introduce DFS for the first time at half the normal retail price and sell it for roughly 30 months. In 62 of those sales villages, we deliver DFS for free directly to 7 randomly assigned households over nearly 24 months. We find no evidence that either selling DFS or providing it for free has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject a reduction of 2.4 percent in the fraction anemic in the entire sample and 1 percent among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by modest purchases and low impact of DFS for the majority of the population, even when consumed somewhat regularly.","[Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, J PAL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Barnhardt, Sharon] CESS Nuffield FLAME Univ, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Barnhardt, S (通讯作者)，CESS Nuffield FLAME Univ, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",barnhardt@post.harvard.edu,,,UK Department for International Development; Initiative for Impact Evaluation; U.S. National Institutes of Health [P01AG005842]; International Food Policy Research Institute; MIT Department of Economics,UK Department for International Development; Initiative for Impact Evaluation; U.S. National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); MIT Department of Economics,"For financial support we thank thank UK Department for International Development, the Initiative for Impact Evaluation, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (P01AG005842), the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the MIT Department of Economics.

In a New Keynesian model consistent with these empirical properties, optimal policy in general delivers a positive inflation rate in the long run. Two special cases deliver classic outcomes under rational expectations: as the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs goes to zero, the long-run inflation rate coincides with the inflation bias under optimal discretion; for non-zero low-frequency drift in beliefs, as households become highly patient valuing utility in any period equally, the optimal long-run inflation rate coincides with optimal commitment price stability is optimal. The optimal state-contingent response to cost-push disturbances similarly reflects properties of optimal discretion and optimal commitment, depending on the degree of low-frequency variation in beliefs. When beliefs exhibit substantial variation in response to short-run forecast errors, optimal policy is closer to commitment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the original innovator's equilibrium exclusivity contracts block subsequent efficient entry even if there is (leader-follower) competition in the contracting phase. However, the legal framework may maximize social welfare by imposing a ban on upfront lump-sum payments in exclusivity contracts (by all suppliers) combined with an outright ban on exclusivity contracts by the derivative innovator. The former ban precludes the exclusion of socially beneficial derivative innovation by causing the incumbent supplier to resort to accommodation, rather than to pure exclusion, strategies. The latter ban complements the former by preventing inefficient or excessive derivative innovation.","[Choi, Jay Pil] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Choi, Jay Pil] Hitotsubashi Univ, Hitotsubashi Inst Adv Study, 2-1 Naka Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Stefanadis, Christodoulos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece",Michigan State University; Hitotsubashi University; University of Piraeus,"Stefanadis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",cstefana@unipi.gr,"Stefanadis, Christodoulos/AAA-4102-2020; Stefanadis, Christodoulos/ABH-2232-2020","Stefanadis, Christodoulos/0000-0001-5974-6454",,,,,40,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Achieving innovation goals decreases CO2 emissions in all models, regardless of natural gas price, due to increased energy efficiency and low-carbon generation becoming more cost competitive. For the models that include domestic natural gas markets, achieving innovation goals lowers wholesale electricity prices, but this effect diminishes as projected natural gas prices increase. Higher natural gas prices lead to higher wholesale electricity prices but fewer coal capacity retirements. A CO2 electric power sector emissions cap influences electric sector evolution under reference technology assumptions but has little to no incremental influence when added to innovation goals. Long-term, meeting innovation goals achieves a generation mix with similar CO2 emissions compared to the CO2 policy but with smaller increases to wholesale electricity prices. In the short-term, the relative effect on wholesale prices differs by model. Finally, higher natural gas prices, achieving innovation goals, and the combination of the two, increases the amount of renewable generation that is cost-effective to build and operate while slowing the growth of natural-gas fired generation, which is the predominant generation type in 2050 under reference conditions.

Our data show that both employment preference and wage offers favor in-group members. Workers positively reciprocate towards in-group employers by choosing higher effort in a gift-exchange game. Thus, favoritism can be privately rational for employers. However, unemployed subjects are allowed to burn resources (at a cost to themselves), and we document significantly increased resource destruction when unemployment can be attributed to favoritism towards others. This highlights a significant spillover and often ignored cost of favoritism, and it points to one possible micro foundation of some antisocial behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Resulting allocations can be inefficient if agents do not internalize the consequences of their choice on others. To test this formally, we study how other-regarding behaviors vary across two decision contexts: when subjects make a pure allocation decision; and when they select a partner. In both settings each subject's decision is final and it affects their payoff and that of other subjects in the same way. We find that subjects are more likely to sacrifice their own material well-being to increase that of others when dividing a pie than when selecting a partner in a large anonymous settingeven though the consequences on the material payoffs of others are identical. These findings suggest that in assignment processes with unilateral selection, efficiency can be improved by presenting the selection process as a choice between outcomes involving multiple individuals, instead of simply selecting a match for themselves.","[Belot, Michele] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Fontanelle 18, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy; [Fafchamps, Marcel] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Encina Hall,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",European University Institute; Stanford University,"Belot, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Fontanelle 18, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",michele.belot@eui.eu; fafchamp@stanford.edu,,,University of Oxford,University of Oxford,"The authors are grateful to the audiences of the IZA Conference on Network Economics in Bonn in June 2013, the Workshop on Social Norms and Preferences in Lyon in October 2015, and the American Social Science Association Conference held in Chicago in January 2017.

In contrast to theories that rely on the increased influence of financial speculators, we examine the effect of interest rates on the volatility and correlation of commodity prices via a panel GARCH model. In theory, lower interest rates decrease the volatility of prices, as lower inventory costs promote the smoothing of transient shocks, and increase price correlation if common shocks are more persistent than idiosyncratic shocks. Empirically, we find that price volatility attributable to transitory shocks declines with interest rates, whereas particularly for metals prices, price correlation increases as interest rates decline.","[Gruber, Joseph W.; Vigfusson, Robert J.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Vigfusson, RJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",robert.vigfusson@frb.gov,,,,,,,20,10,10,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Secondly, non-constrained firms also expand their investment in technology because of increased competition, a pro-competitive effect.

In evaluating the proposals, the organization relies on the agents applying for funding to produce evidence about the merits of their own proposals. When the organization can fund all proposals, each agent engages in an independent game of Bayesian persuasion with the organization, choosing information strategies that maximize the probability of producing evidence in favor of funding. When the organization has limited capacity to implement proposals, the game becomes one of competitive Bayesian persuasion. Producing favorable evidence is not enough to secure funding; an agent must also produce more-favorable evidence than the other agent. We show that an organization's limited capacity leads agents to produce more (Blackwell) informative evidence than they do when the organization is unconstrained. We fully characterize the unique equilibrium under unlimited and limited capacity, and show that unless the prior strongly favors accepting both proposals, the funding organization is better off when its capacity is limited. The analysis highlights similarities between competitive Bayesian persuasion games and all-pay auctions and generalized Colonel Blotto games.","[Boleslavsky, Raphael] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Cotton, Christopher] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Miami; Queens University - Canada,"Cotton, C (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",r.boleslavsky@miami.edu; cotton@econ.queensu.ca,,"Cotton, Christopher/0000-0002-2623-8215",Cotton,Cotton,"The paper greatly benefited from feedback from Dan Kovenock and our referees.

While most of the social psychology literature emphasizes the role of autonomy, recent economic research has provided an alternative explanation based on reciprocity. To understand the behavioral mechanisms underlying such reactions, we conduct an experiment in which we compare two treatments: one in which control is exerted directly by the principal; and the other in which it is exerted by a third party enjoying no residual claimancy rights (third-party control). The results indicate that when either the principal or a third party decides to control the average level of effort that is selected by the agents is similar. What changes remarkably are the agents' reactions to the decision of the other participants not to control. When the principal decides not to control, then the agent exerts greater effort relative to the case when the third party decides not to control. Agents seem to reward principals who abstain from control for their trust, rather than punish controlling ones for their distrust. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We offer a systematic analysis of the development of secular states based on a political economy approach that is centered on the notion of legitimacy. Viewing religion as a legitimizing force for political leaders, we consider the factors affecting the cost and benefits of alternative sources of legitimacy, such as the differential abilities of religious and secular sources to legitimize political rulers and historical inertia that shaped the cost of monitoring legitimizing agents. To examine this argument empirically, we built a cross-national time-series dataset for the relationship between state and religion since the year 1000. We first use the data to examine the evolution of secularism over time and its variation across religious traditions. We then use regression analysis and an instrumental variables approach to identify the influences on the adoption of secular state, such as concentration in the religion market, religious differences between rulers and the general population, historical inertia of a state, and the prevailing political regime. We address endogeneity concerns regarding the relationship between religious concentration and state secularism by exploiting variation among territories in their geographic distance to religious capitals of the world as an instrument.

Inputs can be workers in a firm, risk factors for a disease, securities in a financial market, or nodes in a networked economy. Each input takes its values from a finite set and uncertainty is modeled as a probability distribution over this set. First, we provide an axiomatic solution to this problem, uniquely characterizing a valuation scheme called the a priori Shapley value. Second, we solve the problem of valuing inputs a posteriori that is, after observing output, obtaining the Bayesian Shapley value. Third, we address the question of rationalizing uncertainty in labor supply in a non-cooperative production game where payoffs are given by the Shapley wage function.

Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.","[Kleinberg, Jon] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, CEPR, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; BREAD, Richmond Hts, MO USA",Cornell University; Stanford University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,"Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X; Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052",Simons Foundation; Stanford Data Science Initiative; MacArthur MacArthur; McCormick Foundation; Pritzker Foundation,Simons Foundation; Stanford Data Science Initiative; MacArthur MacArthur; McCormick Foundation; Pritzker Foundation,"We are immensely grateful to Mike Riley for meticulously and tirelessly spearheading the data analytics, with effort well above and beyond the call of duty.

A randomized experiment based around the introduction of the entreprenant legal status in Benin is used to test these assumptions, along with supplementary efforts to enhance the presumed benefits of formalizing to firms. Few firms register when just given information about the new regime, but our full package of supplementary efforts boosts formalization by 16.3 percentage points. However, this formalization does not bring firms higher sales or profits, and the cost of formalizing these firms exceeds the added taxation they will pay over the next decade. We show how better targeting of these policies towards firms that look more like formal firms to begin with can increase the formalization rate and improve cost-effectiveness.","[Benhassine, Najy; McKenzie, David; Santini, Massimiliano] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pouliquen, Victor] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",The World Bank; Paris School of Economics,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,"McKenzie, David/0000-0002-1885-2426","Government of Benin; International Finance Corporation; Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS); U.K. Department for International Development (DFID); Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD); U.S. Agency for International Development through the Impact Program; Research Support Budget (RSB); Strategic Research Program (SRP); Impact Evaluation to Development Impact (i2i) through the WBG's Development Economics Department; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; DFID","Government of Benin; International Finance Corporation; Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services (FIAS); U.K. Department for International Development (DFID); Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD); U.S. Agency for International Development through the Impact Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Research Support Budget (RSB); Strategic Research Program (SRP); Impact Evaluation to Development Impact (i2i) through the WBG's Development Economics Department; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; DFID","The authors owe particular appreciation to all the experts and colleagues who contributed to the design and implementation of the entreprenant program and its impact evaluation: Louis Akakpo, Theodore Anthonioz, Zoubir Benhamouche, Julien Bornon, Laurent Corthay, Tonagnon Dadjo, Matins Deen, Magueye Dia, Benedicta Houetchenou, Ferdinand Ngobounan, Adrien Pawlik, Dolele Sylla, Kjartan Sorensen, Hamidou Sorgo, Adama Tiendrebeogo, and Alain Traore.

An expert's preference is parameterized by his ideal action, or agenda. Common intuition suggests that more information is revealed if the panel includes experts with opposed agendas, because such experts will undo each other's attempts to conceal unfavorable information. In contrast, we show that recruiting experts with diverse agendas is optimal only if the correlation between the experts' types-i.e., whether they are informed or not is above a threshold. Moreover, if the experts' types are independent, under mild assumptions it is optimal to recruit experts who have extreme but identical agendas. These findings suggest that the diversity of preferences must be considered in conjunction with the diversity of information sources, and it is generally sub-optimal to seek diversity in both dimensions.

Buchanan; rationality; methodology; subjectivism,CHOICE-THEORETIC FOUNDATIONS; OPPORTUNITY; PREFERENCES; AGENCY; ORDER,"In light of behavioral findings regarding inconsistent individual decision-making, economists have begun to re-conceptualize the notion of welfare. One prominent account is the preference purification approach (PP), which attempts to reconstruct preferences from choice data based on a normative understanding of neoclassical rationality. Using Buchanan's notion of creative choice, this paper criticizes PP's epistemic, ontological, and psychological assumptions. It identifies PP as a static position that assumes the satisfaction of given 'true preferences' as the normative standard for welfare. However, following Buchanan, choice should be understood dynamically as a process whereby preferences constantly regenerate. Accordingly, the meaning of welfare emerges from an ongoing quest for individual self-constitution. If this holds true, then rationality axioms cannot serve as a priori normative standards. Instead, creative imagination and learning processes must remain central to any understanding of welfare in economics.","[Dold, Malte F.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Dold, MF (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",malte.dold@nyu.edu,,,,,,,60,19,19,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

But field experiments find that matching doesn't always increase donations. Individuals may believe that peers will exhaust the matching funds, so their donation isn't pivotal. We develop a theory of how beliefs about peers' donations affect one's likelihood of donation. We test our theory using novel threshold match treatments in field and laboratory experiments. One threshold match treatment more than doubles the donation rate relative to no match. To understand the mechanism behind this increase, we use a lab study to show that beliefs about peers' donations matter. Our theoretical, lab, and field results combined suggest people are more likely to donate when they believe they are more pivotal to securing matching money. Beliefs about others matter, and they should be taken into account when trying to increase donations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While increased agricultural productivity can improve economic welfare and help address food security problems by benefiting both consumers and producers simultaneously, it also must address the depletion of already scarce natural resources. In the context of a changing climate, sustainable and resilient agricultural production forms a major cornerstone of both adaptation and mitigation strategies. The global community needs to have the proper tools with which to monitor sustainable agricultural productivity gains, identify countries and sectors lagging behind, and commit R&D efforts accordingly to address the challenges ahead. As such, it is suggested that 1) an international consortium should monitor agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) to provide international comparisons and track performance over time; 2) the G20 should acknowledge and address the issue of sustainable productivity measurement, and; 3) the G20 should support more in-depth research into the relationship between agricultural TFP and agricultural R&D.","[Laborde, David; Pineiro, Valeria] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Piñeiro, V (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",v.pineiro@cgiar.org,,"Pineiro, Valeria/0000-0002-4372-7141; Matthews, Alan/0000-0003-1051-1499",,,,,16,4,4,0,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 7,2018,12,,,,,,,,201866,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-66,0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HD7OO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000452743100001,0

These losses stem from frictions such as search costs, switching costs, and rational inattention, as well as what we call mental gaps resulting from wrong priors/worldviews, or relevant features of a problem not being top of mind. Most research studying such losses does not empirically distinguish between these mechanisms. Instead, we show that most highly cited papers in this area presume one mechanism underlies consumer choices and assume away other potential explanations, or collapse many mechanisms together. We discuss the empirical difficulties that arise in distinguishing between different mechanisms, and some promising approaches for making progress in doing so. We also assess when it is more or less important for researchers to distinguish between these mechanisms. Approaches that seek to identify true value from demand, without specifying mechanisms behind this wedge, are most useful when researchers are interested in evaluating allocation policies that strongly steer consumers towards better options with regulation, traditional policy instruments, and defaults. On the other hand, understanding the precise mechanisms underlying consumer losses is essential to predicting the impact of mechanism policies aimed primarily at reducing specific frictions or mental gaps without otherwise steering consumers. We make the case that papers engaging with these questions empirically should be clear about whether their analyses distinguish between mechanisms behind poorly informed choices, and what that implies for the questions they can answer. We present examples from several empirical contexts to highlight these distinctions.","[Handel, Benjamin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schwartzstein, Joshua] Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Handel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",handel@berkeley.edu; jschwartzstein@hbs.edu,,,,,,,70,56,76,2,129,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This paper adds to the conversation by investigating the impact of bank distress on firms' exports using matched firm-bank data for the UK. We use two novel measures of bank distress: the Basel III net stable funding ratio, as well as the market-based bank credit default swap spreads, which best capture bank default risk, especially during crises. Our detailed database provides the crucial firm bank relationship information that allows us to directly test for the banking channel effect on the real economy, and to carefully account for various endogeneities and biases in estimation. We also test for the possible contagion of the Sovereign Debt Crisis from the GIIPS economies to the UK. We find that the severe bank distress generated by the recent crises immediately, negatively and significantly affects UK firms' exports, independent of demand shocks. Not all firms were impacted equally: private firms and firms in industries more dependent on external finance were impacted the most, while publicly owned firms were less affected by their bank's distress.

It allows for simultaneity in the econometric sense that the two realized outcomes depend structurally on each other. Another feature of the proposed model is that it will generate equal durations with positive probability. Our approach takes a stylized economic model that leads to a univariate generalized accelerated failure time model as a starting point. In this model, agents decide when to transition from an initial state to a new one, and the covariates influence the difference in the utility flow in the two states. We introduce simultaneity by allowing the utility flow to depend on the status of the other person. The econometric model is then completed by assuming that the observed outcome is the Nash bargaining solution in that simple economic model. The advantage of this approach is that it includes independent realizations from the generalized accelerated failure time model as a special case, and deviations from this special case can be given an economic interpretation. We established identification under assumptions that are similar to those in the literature on nonparametric estimation of duration models. We illustrate the model by studying the joint retirement decisions in married couples using the Health and Retirement Study. In that example, it seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that each partner's optimal retirement time depends on the retirement time of the spouse. Moreover, the data suggest that the wife and the husband retire at the same time for a nonnegligible fraction of couples. The main empirical finding is that the simultaneity is economically important. In our preferred specification, the indirect utility associated with being retired increases by approximately 5% when one's spouse retires.","[Honore, Bo E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [de Paula, Aureo] UCL, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, FGV,CeMMAP, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, High Wycombe, Bucks, England",Princeton University; University of London; University College London,"Honoré, BE (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",honore@princeton.edu; a.paula@ucl.ac.uk,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448",Center for Retirement Research (Boston College); National Science Foundation; Gregory C.

In the first part of the paper, we present new evidence from a survey. We show that individuals are more generous towards poor people whom they perceive to be diligent workers relative to poor people whom they perceive to be non-diligent, a social preference that we label sympathy for the diligent. This preference is much stronger than preferences regarding other characteristics of the poor, such as race, nationality, and disability. More important, we show that subjects with higher sympathy for the diligent have a stronger preference for workfare programs. In the second part of the paper, we incorporate our empirical findings into a model of income redistribution. We consider the case of a benevolent government with fairness concerns that prioritizes the well-being of individuals who exert the most effort. We characterize the optimal conditions under which the government introduces work requirements. Even if wasteful, work requirements can be optimal, because they allow for a better distinction between individuals who exert great effort and individuals who do not. However, if the government lacks commitment power, the availability of screening through work requirements leads to a lower equilibrium effort and, possibly, a Pareto-dominated allocation.

We analyze the implications of hysteresis for fiscal policy in a DSGE model. We assume a simple learning-by-doing mechanism where demand-driven changes in employment can affect the level of productivity permanently, leading to hysteresis in output. We show that the fiscal output multiplier is much larger in the presence of hysteresis and that the welfare multiplier of fiscal policy-the consumption equivalent change in welfare for one dollar change in public spending-is positive (negative) in the presence (absence) of hysteresis. The main benefit of accommodative fiscal policy in the presence of hysteresis is to diminish the damage of a recession to the long-term level of productivity and, thus, output. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Through the lens of the model, taxes, together with wages and the educational composition, account for a significant part of the small differences in married men's and the large differences in married women's hours worked in the data. Taking the full non-linearities of labour income tax codes, including the tax treatment of married couples, into account is crucial for generating the low cross-country correlation between married men's and women's hours worked in the data, and for explaining the variation of married women's hours worked across European countries.","[Bick, Alexander] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Fuchs-Schundeln, Nicola] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CFS, Frankfurt, Germany; [Fuchs-Schundeln, Nicola] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Goethe University Frankfurt; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Bick, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,,,Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at Goethe University; European Research Council [262116]; Fritz Thyssen Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [262116] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at Goethe University; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Fritz Thyssen Foundation; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Domenico Ferraro, Berthold Herrendorf, Paul Klein, Dirk Krueger, Jose-Victor RiosRull, Richard Rogerson, Kjetil Storesletten, the editor and four anonymous referees, as well as numerous seminar and conference participants for helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper examines the incidence and determinants of low levels of financial and total wealth using repeated cross-sections of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and a small longitudinal sample of HRS respondents observed both at age 65 and shortly before death. Most of those who report very low wealth holdings at the end of their life had little wealth at the traditional retirement age of 65. There is strong persistence over time in reports of very low wealth, and more generally relatively little evidence that wealth is drawn down in the first 15 years of retirement. The age specific probability of reporting low wealth increases slowly after age 65. Low lifetime earnings are strongly predictive of low wealth at retirement and at the end of life. The post-retirement onset of a major medical condition, and, for married women, the loss of their spouse, are both associated with small increases in the probability of reporting very low wealth, but they account for a small fraction of low-wealth outcomes. Low levels of wealth accumulation before age 65, rather than gaps in the safety net after 65 or rapid spend-down of accumulated assets, appear to be the primary determinant of low levels of wealth just before death.

We also find that the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) adversely affects the production of cleaner energy. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of financial market development, cleaner energy, and controlling for the effect of government subsidy on cleaner energy. By supporting the demand-induced supply of cleaner energy, we demonstrate that the positive and significant effect of financial market development (FMD) on cleaner energy is stronger in countries with higher growth in carbon intensity and a lower availability of fossil fuels than otherwise. Our results also support the argument that financing uncertain projects such as those that produce cleaner energy should be greater in countries with a higher innovation culture than those where financial markets are already accustomed to undertaking.risky investments. The overall results are also robust under the conditions of short-run and long-run homogeneity and the cross-sectional dependence in the sample. Policy implications are also provided.

There exist a continuum of stationary equilibria, a continuum of endogenous credit cycles of any periodicity, and a continuum of sunspot equilibria, irrespective of the assumed trading mechanism. Equilibria featuring too-tight solvency constraints can generate growing credit limits over time, periodic credit shutdowns, and heterogeneous debt limits across ex-ante identical borrowers.

We propose an analytically solvable multi-country model of endogenous selection in which dominant exporters, dominant products and dominant buyers emerge in parallel as multi-product sellers with heterogeneous technologies compete for buyers with heterogeneous needs. The model not only provides an explanation of the existence of dominant buyers but also makes specific predictions on how the relative importance of dominant buyers should vary across export destinations depending on their market size and accessibility.

Moreover, they are reminiscent of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism, even though the latter is not incentive compatible with interdependent valuations.

Shifts in labor demand can be measured through changes in employment and earnings, the main labor market outcomes, or through changes in the population and income, more generally. These changes may spillover into the nonresource economy, leading to greater overall effects or possibly crowd out; be spread unequally across the population, thereby altering the distribution of income and the poverty rate; or influence educational attainment, as people choose between additional schooling and work. In this review, the literature linking natural resources to local labor markets is synthesized by organizing existing studies according to their resource measurement and the outcomes that they consider. This synthesis provides an accessible guide to a literature that has boomed in recent years. It also identifies promising avenues for future research and lays a foundation to further generalize the evidence through an eventual meta-analysis.","[Marchand, Joseph] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Weber, Jeremy] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of Alberta; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Marchand, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",joseph.marchand@ualberta.ca,"Marchand, Joseph/GSD-7311-2022","Marchand, Joseph/0000-0002-5894-320X",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors would like to recognize research funding, in the form of a Knowledge Synthesis Grant, received from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.",,89,49,53,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We show that there always exists an equilibrium in this general setting with two-dimensional types of ex ante heterogeneous bidders. When bidders are ex ante homogeneous, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium, but asymmetric equilibria may also exist. We provide conditions under which the equilibrium is unique (not only among symmetric ones). We find that the marginal density of participation costs and the concentration of values matter for the uniqueness. The presence of private information on participation costs tends to reduce multiplicity of participation equilibria, although multiplicity still persists.","[Cao, Xiaoyong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tan, Guofu] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tian, Guoqiang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Yilankaya, Okan] Nazarbayev Univ, Dept Econ, Astana, Kazakhstan",University of International Business & Economics; University of Southern California; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Nazarbayev University,"Tan, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",yongcx2000@uibe.edu.cn; guofutan@usc.edu; tian@econmail.tamu.edu; okan.yilankaya@nu.edu.kz,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-71201030, NSFC-71371117]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [14YQ02]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant(European Union (EU)),We thank three anonymous referees and a co-editor for helpful comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

We demonstrate that in a small open economy with a high level of debt, a small increase in the risk premium of the interest rate leads to a substantial contraction in output and negative welfare effects. We then quantify the effects of reducing the debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio using a wide range of fiscal austerity measures. Our results indicate trade-offs between short-run contractions and long-run expansions in aggregate output. In the short run, spending-based austerity reforms are worse than tax-based reforms in terms of lost income. However, in the long run, spending-based reforms produce higher output than tax-based reforms. In addition, welfare effects vary significantly across generations, skill groups, and working sectors. The current old and middle-aged generations experience welfare losses, whereas future generations are beneficiaries of the reforms.","[Glomm, Gerhard] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Jung, Juergen] Towson Univ, Towson, MD USA; [Tran, Chung] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Maryland; Towson University; Australian National University,"Glomm, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",gglomm@indiana.edu,,"Tran, Chung/0000-0001-8252-469X; Jung, Juergen/0000-0003-3791-6293",Towson University Research Fellowship Program; ANU Research Grant,Towson University Research Fellowship Program; ANU Research Grant,"We appreciate comments from participants in the Australasian Macroeconomics Workshop 2012, the Midwest Macroeconomics Meeting 2012, and the 18th International Conference of Computing in Economics and Finance 2012, and from two anonymous referees.

Reforming energy subsidies thus requires overcoming a policy commitment problem. In this paper we show that, even when commitment is feasible, it may fail to materialize in a political equilibrium due to politicians' re-election incentives.

This article captures the impact of capacity constraints on quality and quantity competition of restaurant industry by employing a two-stage asymmetric capacity constraints model. There are several findings from this study. First, results of this study indicate that reputation difference increases total outputs and quality in equilibrium. Second, capacity constraints decrease the consumer surplus (CS) as well as social welfare (SW), but restaurants benefit from capacity constraints sometimes. Third, capacity reduces both the quality and quantity of the competitor. Furthermore, restaurants raise their prices if consumers are quality-sensitive or lower the quality if consumers are price-sensitive under capacity constraints. Fourth, this study compares the total quality, CS, and SW under four cases: no restaurant faces constraints, small restaurant faces constraints, big restaurant faces constraints, and both small and big restaurants face constraints. The total quality investment, CS, and SW are highest if a small restaurant faces capacity constraints while the larger one does not.","[Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA",South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",heqy83@scau.edu.cn,"; Chen, You-hua/M-4136-2013","He, Qinying/0000-0003-1234-5690; Chen, You-hua/0000-0001-5697-9295","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71401057, 71771057, 71573092]; Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD13YLJ02]; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province [2014A070704008]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]; key National Social Science Fund of PRC [14AJY020]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633002, 71333004]","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province; key National Social Science Fund of PRC; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work is partially supported by Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS (2012) and National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (71401057, 71771057, 71573092), Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD13YLJ02), The Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province (2014A070704008), Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & Industry, and Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province (2015WCXTD009), the key National Social Science Fund of PRC (14AJY020), and the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71633002; 71333004).",,38,13,14,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world.

In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses revisions in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country's interest rate if it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest rates are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and document patterns of 2.5-lemma or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Under bounded memory (only recent periods are observed), long memory still yields bad reputation due to an echo where bad signals cause future motorists to not hire, causing further lack of hiring, and so on. Short memory avoids bad reputation by making it useless, because consumers never learn enough information to change their decisions. No happy middle exists under bounded memory where consumers learn valuable information without tempting the mechanic into harmful signaling and thereby unraveling the market. By contrast, fading memory (past periods are randomly sampled with fading probabilities) achieves this happy middle by offering valuable information in a way that bounds the probabilities of these reputational echoes.

Using two widely known dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, we simulate a hypothetical financial crisis and examine how each model performs when the misspecification occurs in the credit channel. We demonstrate that monetary policy suggested by misspecified models tends to destabilize the economy during crisis, even though one of the two models does reasonably well in estimating policy-invariant model parameters. We also show that the opportunity cost of using a misspecified model is high relative to the outcome achieved under a correctly specified model, particularly when public financial intermediation is available in the correctly specified model. Introducing labor-related variables in either the monetary policy rule or stabilization objectives has the potential of improving policy outcomes in the misspecified credit channel model.","[Yagihashi, Takeshi] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2021 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Yagihashi, T (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2021 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",tyagihas@odu.edu,"Yagihashi, Takeshi/AAF-1254-2020","Yagihashi, Takeshi/0000-0001-9916-6008",,,,,74,6,6,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using both high dimensional fixed effects and regression discontinuity designs, we demonstrate that firms constrained by campaign contribution limits spend between $549,000 and $1.6M more on lobbying per election cycle, an amount that is more than 100 times the campaign contribution limit.

We propose a simple model where advertising disproportionately benefits non-dominant political parties, because voters are uncertain about and biased against such parties. We test this argument in Mexico, where one of the three main parties dominates in many localities. To identify the effects of exposure to campaign advertising, we exploit differences across neighboring precincts in campaign ad distribution. These differences originate from cross-state media coverage spillovers induced by a 2007 reform that equalized access to ad slots across all broadcast media. We find that, on average, ads on AM radio increase the vote shares of the PAN and the PRD, but not the previously hegemonic PRI. Consistent with our model, campaign advertising is most effective in poorly informed and politically uncompetitive electoral precincts, and against locally dominant parties of intermediate strength.","[Larreguy, Horacio A.; Snyder, James M., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Marshall, John] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Harvard University; Columbia University,"Larreguy, HA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hlarreguy@fas.harvard.edu; jm4401@columbia.edu; jsnyder@gov.harvard.edu,"Arbesu, Horacio Larreguy/AAF-2867-2020","Arbesu, Horacio Larreguy/0000-0001-8491-6400",,,,,54,9,16,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Often the decision maker's information about the state is incomplete; hence, the generalization to Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). Unfortunately, POMDPs may require a large state and/or action space, creating the well-known curse of dimensionality. However, recent computational contributions and blindingly fast computers have helped to dispel this curse. This paper introduces and addresses a second curse termed curse of ambiguity, which refers to the fact that the exact transition probabilities are often hard to quantify, and are rather ambiguous. For instance, for a monetary authority concerned with dynamically setting the inflation rate so as to control the unemployment, the dynamics of unemployment rate under any given inflation rate is often ambiguous. Similarly, in worker-job matching, the dynamics of worker-job match/proficiency level is typically ambiguous. This paper addresses the curse of ambiguity by developing a generalization of POMDPs termed Ambiguous POMDPs (APOMDPs), which not only allows the decision maker to take into account imperfect state information, but also tackles the inevitable ambiguity with respect to the correct probabilistic model of transitions. Importantly, this paper extends various structural results from POMDPs to APOMDPs. These results enable the decision maker to make robust decisions. Robustness is achieved by using alpha-maximin expected utility (alpha-MEU), which (a) differentiates between ambiguity and ambiguity attitude, (b) avoids the over conservativeness of traditional maximin approaches, and (c) is found to be suitable in laboratory experiments in various choice behaviors including those in portfolio selection. The structural results provided also help to handle the curse of dimensionality, since they significantly simplify the search for an optimal policy. The analysis also identifies a performance guarantee for the proposed approach by developing a bound for its maximum reward loss due to model ambiguity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In one case, joint asymptotics apply when both the sample size diverges and the threshold effect shrinks to zero, whereas sequential asymptotics operate in the other case in which the sample size diverges first and the threshold effect shrinks subsequently.

We exploit the 2003-2004 California workers' compensation reforms which reduced medical spending disproportionately for workers incurring low back injuries. We link administrative claims data to earnings records for injured workers and their uninjured coworkers. We find that workers with low back injuries experienced a 7.6 percent post-reform decline in medical care, and an 8.1 percent drop in post-injury earnings relative to other injured workers.","[Powell, David] RAND, 1200 S Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Seabury, Seth] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Emergency Med, 635 Downey Way,VPD 414C, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Seabury, Seth] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way,VPD 414C, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",RAND Corporation; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Powell, D (通讯作者)，RAND, 1200 S Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",dpowell@rand.org; seabury@usc.edu,,,NIA [1R01AG046290]; Bing Center for Health Economics,NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Bing Center for Health Economics,"Powell: RAND, 1200 S.

Inspired by ROSCAs, we offer different credit and saving contracts to subjects. We find that individuals often accept both credit and saving contract across experimental waves. This behaviour can be rationalised by assuming that individuals seek lump-sum payments and struggle to hold savings. Structural estimation of this model accounts for the behaviour of 75% of participants. Of these, two-thirds have high demand for lump-sum accumulation but savings difficulties.

In the estimated model, good news about productivity raises leverage, increasing the probability that a Sudden Stop occurs in future periods. In the run-up to the Sudden Stop, the economy exhibits a boom period with consumption and investment above trend, consistent with the data. During the Sudden Stop, the nonlinear effects of the constraint induce consumption and investment to fall substantially below trend and the trade balance to reverse sharply, as they do in the data. The risk created by good news is large, with nearly 90% of Sudden Stops occurring after positive news shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Economic miracles and failures are embedded within extended phases of either growth or decline. In this paper, we analyze the growth patterns of developing and newly industrialized countries on the basis of structural breaks and growth regimes experienced. Emphasizing the presence of broken trends, we focus on the difference between expansionary and recessionary regimes of medium length, and we show that models of takeoffs and exponential growth are inadequate to characterize the majority of observed growth dynamics. Then, we move to a systematic classification of different patterns and we isolate an additional stylized fact characterizing the process of growth and development. In particular, our results show that expansionary regimes are associated with convergence and positive correlation between growth and (short run) volatility. By contrast, in recessionary regimes, poorer countries face deeper failures and a negative correlation between growth and volatility is found, indicating that output fluctuates less around the trend during strong rather than mild recessions. Catching-up phenomena are infrequent but more likely to occur across categories of growth patterns rather than within. Finally, we discover that regimes of growth and recession show similar average length (about 16 years). Although recessions are, on average, remarkably pronounced (14% loss of GDP per capita), the magnitude of growth is much larger during expansions. In sum, our results underline that stable positive growth is hardly achieved in developing countries, which rather alternate long phases of expansions with equally long phases of recession. Moreover, cross-sectional empirical regularities are found to differ between regimes of positive and negative growth.","[Lamperti, Francesco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Lamperti, Francesco] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Mattei, Clara Elisabetta] New Sch Social Res, 6 E 16th St,Room 1119, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mattei, Clara Elisabetta] Scuola Super Sant Anna, 6 E 16th St,Room 1119, New York, NY 10003 USA",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Fondazione Mattei; The New School,"Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.;Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",f.lamperti@santannapisa.it; matteic@newschool.edu,,,,,,,58,9,9,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Marmot argues that in developed countries, poor health does not cause low incomes; rather, low socioeconomic status leads to poor health, but not because of proximate factors like differential health care access, which can explain only a small portion of these gaps. Therefore, to eliminate health gaps, policy should focus on the deep causes of disease: poverty, education, and occupational mobility, among others. While Marmot's ethical arguments are quite compelling, his recommendations are too strong given the current evidence. Policies need to be based on a clearer understanding of why things work, when, and for whom.","[Lleras-Muney, Adriana] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Lleras-Muney, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,,126,9,12,1,24,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

After implementing a social network census, one of three village-level treatments determined which treated nodes in the village received information about composting: random assignment, nodes with the highest degree, or nodes with high betweenness. We then look at how information diffuses through the network. We find information diffusion declines with social distance, suggesting frictions in the diffusion of information. Aggregate knowledge about the technology did not differ across targeting strategies, but targeting nodes using betweenness measures in village level networks excludes less-connected nodes from new information. Women fanners are less likely to receive information when betweenness centrality is used in targeting, suggesting there are important gender differences, not only in the relationship between social distance and diffusion, but also in the social learning process.","[Beaman, Lori] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dillon, Andrew] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Northwestern University; Michigan State University,"Dillon, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dillona6@msu.edu,,,"German Development Ministry (BMZ); International Food Policy Research Institute; Millennium Challenge Corporation; Millennium Challenge Account-Mali; Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research; National Science Foundation [1254380]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1254380] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","German Development Ministry (BMZ); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); Millennium Challenge Corporation; Millennium Challenge Account-Mali; Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors acknowledge financial support for fieldwork from the German Development Ministry (BMZ), International Food Policy Research Institute, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Millennium Challenge Account-Mali, and Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research.

Furthermore, we find that DA remains more stable than IA, regardless of scale. We then further increase the number of participants per match to 4,000 through the introduction of robots. When robots report their preferences truthfully, we find that scale has no effect on human best response behavior.

Using these indicators, we separately estimate the effects of overall and gender-specific economic shocks. We find only modest evidence of a link between overall economic conditions and child maltreatment. However, analysis by gender reveals robust evidence that maltreatment decreases with indicators for male employment and increases with indicators for female employment. These opposite-signed effects are consistent with a theoretical framework that builds on household-time-use models and is supported by an analysis of time-use data, though we discuss other mechanisms that may also play important roles.

This paper presents new evidence of this empirical regularity known as the Twin Ds and proposes a model that rationalizes it as an optimal policy outcome. The model combines limited enforcement of debt contracts and downward nominal wage rigidity. Under optimal policy, default is shown to occur during contractions. The role of default is to free up resources for domestic absorption, and the role of exchange rate devaluation is to lower the real value of wages, thereby reducing involuntary unemployment.","[Na, Seunghoon] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin] Columbia Univ, 420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin; Yue, Vivian] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yue, Vivian] Emory Univ, 201 Dowman Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Yue, Vivian] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Columbia University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Emory University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Na, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sn2518@columbia.edu; stephanie.schmittgrohe@columbia.edu; martin.uribe@columbia.edu; vivianyuel1@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Martin Eichenbaum, Coeditor.

The now-standard heterogeneous firm model posits measurezero firms that compete under monopolistic competition and decide whether to export to foreign markets. However, much of international trade is dominated by a few global firms, which participate in the international economy along multiple margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We develop a new theoretical framework that allows firms to have large market shares and decide simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to export, and inputs to import. Using US firm and trade transactions data, we provide strong evidence in support of this framework's main predictions of interdependencies and complementarities between these margins of firm international participation. Global firms participate more intensively along each margin, magnifying the impact of underlying differences in firm characteristics and increasing their shares of aggregate trade.","[Bernard, Andrew B.] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Jensen, J.

The increase in GDP per capita that ASEAN economies experienced during 1970-2010 significantly contributed to a higher share of income accruing to the middle class in these countries. Econometric model estimates show that the impact of a rise of the middle class on economic growth depends on initial levels of GDP per capita. In the majority of ASEAN countries, a rise of the middle class that is unrelated to GDP per capita growth would have had a significant negative effect on economic growth for levels of ASEAN economies' GDP per capita in 1970. In contrast, for recent values of GDP per capita a rise of the middle class would positively contribute to growth of GDP per capita in ASEAN. We show that investment is an important channel through which the income share of the middle class affects economic growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Based on CPS data from 1980 to 2015, we find that increasing the minimum wage decreases significantly the share of automatable employment held by low-skilled workers, and increases the likelihood that low-skilled workers in automatable jobs become nonemployed or employed in worse jobs. The average effects mask significant heterogeneity by industry and demographic group, including substantive adverse effects for older, low-skilled workers in manufacturing. We also find some evidence that the same changes improve job opportunities for higher-skilled workers. The findings imply that groups often ignored in the minimum wage literature are in fact quite vulnerable to employment changes and job loss because of automation following a minimum wage increase.","[Lordan, Grace] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Neumark, David] UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dneumark@uci.edu,,,,,,,42,56,59,6,79,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2018,52,,,,,,40,53,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.03.006,0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL1ZV,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436913700004,0

The central question in this paper is how to design monetary policy when expectations formation is not perfectly rational. Instrumental rules that use actual rather than forecasted inflation produce lower inflation variability and reduce expectational cycles. A forward-looking Taylor rule where a reaction coefficient equals 4 produces lower inflation variability than rules with reaction coefficients of 1.5 and 1.35. Inflation variability produced with the latter two rules is not significantly different. Moreover, the forecasting rules chosen by subjects appear to vary systematically with the policy regime, with destabilizing mechanisms chosen more often when inflation control is weaker.","[Pfajfar, Damjan] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Zakelj, Blaz] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Pompeu Fabra University,"Pfajfar, D (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",damjan.pfajfar@frb.gov,,,,,,,52,31,31,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In this data, consumer search behavior is observed prior to a transaction. I use data on consumers shopping for books online to link prices and consumer search patterns at different bookstores, estimating consumer search costs in the context of a fixed-sample search model. The search patterns indicate that consumers visit relatively few firms and exhibit a strong search preference for prominent retailers. I control for search intensities at different retailers during consumers' search process and find that search cost estimates are lower than when assuming consumers sample equally among alternatives. Accounting for heterogeneity in consumer search intensities across retailers reduces search cost estimates from $2.30 to $1.24 per search. I examine search cost heterogeneity by using a rich set of consumer characteristics and relating them to search patterns and search costs estimates. I use a flexible random effects model in which the number and order of firms visited by the consumer are her optimal ordered choices, allowing search cost cutoffs to depend on regressors. The estimates indicate that consumer search costs are related to their observable characteristics, such as income, where individuals with income greater than $100,000 incur relatively higher search costs.

This inverted U-shaped, cross-sectional relationship between emigration and development was first hypothesized by Zelinsky's theory of the mobility transition. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the upward segment of the curve (the most common being the existence of financial constraints), they have not been examined in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose two decomposition methods to disentangle the main drivers of the mobility transition curve to OECD destination countries. Our simple decompositions shed light on the role of both microeconomic drivers (i.e., financial incentives and constraints) and macroeconomic drivers, as well as the skill composition of the population. Our double decomposition further distinguishes between migration aspirations and realization rates by education level. Overall, we provide consistent evidence that the role of financial constraints, while relevant for the poorest countries, is limited. Rather, a large fraction of the increasing segment is explained by the skill composition and by macroeconomic drivers (i.e., by factors that do not change in the short-run).","[Thu Hien Dao; Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thu Hien Dao] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, Bielefeld, Germany; [Docquier, Frederic] Natl Fund Sci Res, FNRS, Brussels, Belgium; [Parsons, Chris] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Bielefeld; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; University of Western Australia; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",daothuhien.dth@gmail.com; frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be; christopher.parsons@uwa.edu.au; gperi@ucdavis.edu,,"Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141; Parsons, Christopher/0000-0001-8528-4089",European Commission under European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus framework,European Commission under European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus framework,"This paper benefited from very helpful suggestions from two anonymous referees.

Anecdotally, the expectation of free assistance is thought to be important for decisions about insurance and risky behavior in numerous settings, but reliable empirical evidence is scarce. We estimate whether the Samaritan's dilemma exists in U.S. agriculture, where both private crop insurance and frequent federal disaster assistance are present. We find that bailout expectations are qualitatively and quantitatively important for the insurance decision. Furthermore, aid expectations reduce both expenditure on farm inputs and subsequent crop revenue.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a sender to never gain by becoming informed. Our key condition (sequential redundancy) shows that the informativeness of public experiments can substitute for the sender's expertise. We then provide conditions for private information to strictly benefit or strictly hurt the sender.

Based on these findings, we provide the first concrete tournament-consisting of 24 alternatives-in which the tournament equilibrium set fails to be stable.

However, high investment costs and risk hinder the diffusion of CCS. To avoid stranded assets or high future costs for retrofitting, new plants can be made carbon capture ready (CCR) to enable them to accommodate future CCS retrofitting at low additional costs. Current CCR investment decisions are closely related to future CCS retrofitting and CCS operation decisions in subsequent stages, all of which would be affected by uncertainties. We develop a three-stage CCR investment decision model under multiple uncertainties which allows for investment and especially operating flexibilities. Applying this model to China shows that CCS operating flexibility under the carbon-pricing scheme may actually lower the probability of investing in a CCR plant, and neglecting it may overestimate the propensity for investing in CCR. Moreover, learning effects, which reduce the costs of future CCS retrofitting, may be detrimental to CCR investment, indicating that the policy support for research on, development of, and deployment of CCS to reduce CCS costs should be coordinated with CCR investments. Although higher electricity prices can increase the value of an investment opportunity, it may restrain CCR investment. Finally, CCR investment does not appear to be economically viable under current conditions in China because of low carbon prices, high carbon price risks, high CCR investment costs and the high opportunity costs of CCS operation.

In an array of laboratory experiments we vary the amount of interactions (communication and/or transfers without commitment) available to bidders. We find that communication alone leads to statistically significant but limited price drops. When, in addition, bidders can exchange transfers, revenues decline substantially, with over 70% of our experimental auctions culminating in the object being sold for approximately the minimal price. Furthermore, the effects of communication and transfers are similar across auction formats. We contrast these results with those generated in repeated auctions. By and large, repeated auctions yield lower collusion and lower efficiency levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to provide a critical review of the legal issues arising from using BIM and of their associated solutions. A systematic review was conducted of fifty-five (55) journal articles and conference papers published from 2007 to 2017 to identify the legal issues. The identified legal issues were then analysed in relation to the solutions provided by the construction industry. The results of the study revealed that (1) an alternative project delivery approach that does not modify the original orientation of the design-bid-build procurement structure is required to deliver BIM effectively. (2) The potential change in the standard of care for project participants due to additional roles required in delivering BIM needs further investigation. (3) The roles for auditing a BIM delivery system must be included in the contracts to ensure the quality and compliance of BIM deliverables. The study not only reviews the legal issues associated with BIM, but more importantly, it also offers significant insights for future research.","[Fan, Su-Ling] Res Dev Ctr Construct Law, D204,5,Lane 199,Kinghua St, Taipei 10650, Taiwan; [Fan, Su-Ling] Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 151 Ying Chuan Rd, Tamsui, Taipei County, Taiwan; [Lee, Cen-Ying] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Tamkang University; Curtin University; Curtin University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lee, CY (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Bentley, WA, Australia.",cenying.lee@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018; Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017; Lee, Cen Ying/AEH-0405-2022; Su-Ling, Fan/AAV-9497-2021","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530; Lee, Cen Ying/0000-0001-6222-2061; Su-Ling, Fan/0000-0002-0552-5442",,,,,80,29,30,2,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We consider first an AK model, and then introduce public capital. Labour supply is exogenous. We find analytically that the presence of wealth positionality always causes distortions ( although a preference for absolute wealth by itself is non-distortionary). Consumption positionality introduces a distortion only if wealth is an argument in the utility function and the marginal degree of positionality in wealth does not match that of consumption. Two corrective tax instruments, a consumption or an income tax, are required for internalization of externalities in an AK set-up; the optimal choice of public investment is an additional instrument when public capital is introduced. Numerical simulations-pointing towards high corrective tax rates and their strong impact on growth and welfare-complement the theoretical analysis.","[Ghosh, Sugata] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Wendner, Ronald] Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wendner, Ronald] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria",Brunel University; Harvard University; University of Graz,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",sugata.ghosh@brunel.ac.uk; ronald_wendner@fas.harvard.edu,"Wendner, Ronald/X-3925-2019","Wendner, Ronald/0000-0003-1938-1424",Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien,Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien,Financial support by the Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien is gratefully aknowledged.,,66,3,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We do this by setting up a general policy problem in which forward guidance plays a role, and then examine the consequences for performance when that guidance is withdrawn. We show that forward guidance provides enhanced controllability and stabilizability-especially where such properties may not otherwise be available. As a by-product, we find that forward guidance limits the scope and incentives for time-inconsistent behavior in an economy whose policy goals are ultimately reachable. It also adds to the credibility of a set of policies.","[Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Acocella, Nicola] Sapienza Univ Rome, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",George Mason University; University of St Andrews; Sapienza University Rome,"Acocella, N (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",nicola.acocella@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Following report release, volume increases and remains elevated for up to 15 to 20 minutes. The volume spikes for the non-trading releases relative to the trading releases, but are identical after the first reaction. Report releases during non-trading hours cause a large spike in volatility at the onset of trading which subsides quickly. In contrast, releases during trading hours result in a smaller volatility spike, which extends for 5-6 min at a higher magnitude. Adjusting volatility by normal trading volatility indicates that volatility in trading hour release is higher in both immediate response and persistence. Return correlations provide little evidence to support systematic under-or overreaction in prices regardless of when the report is released reflecting the efficiency of the market.","[Joseph, Kishore] Calif State Univ Chico, Coll Agr, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA",California State University System; California State University Chico; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Joseph, K (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Chico, Coll Agr, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",kjoseph5@csuchico.edu,,,"Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; College of Agriculture, California State University Chico","Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; College of Agriculture, California State University Chico","This work was supported by the Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the College of Agriculture, California State University Chico.",,41,11,11,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It was composed of two sub-hypotheses: First, the natural rate of unemployment is independent of monetary policy. Second, there is no long-run trade-off between the deviation of unemployment from the natural rate and inflation. Both propositions have been challenged. The paper reviews the arguments and the macro and micro evidence against each. It concludes that, in each case, the evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Policymakers should keep the natural rate hypothesis as their null hypothesis, but keep an open mind and put some weight on the alternatives.","[Blanchard, Olivier] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Blanchard, Olivier] MIT, Econ Emeritus, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Blanchard, O (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Blanchard, O (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ Emeritus, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,31,80,85,0,41,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This is a crucial question for those who think about the sources of economic growth and especially for those who think about policies and institutions to promote innovation. The answer lies in part with the structure of the existing system of production and the array of assets that an innovation would displace, especially on the extent of complementarity and modularity in that structure. But it also depends on institutions. This paper argues for the centrality of decision rights to the process of innovation. Especially if it takes place in a systemic, non-modular way, innovation may require unified decision rights, often implying integrated control of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision, differentiation, and learning - the processes of fission, forking, and fine tuning - may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.","[Langlois, Richard N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Langlois, Richard N.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Inst & Polit Econ Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Connecticut; University of Witwatersrand,"Langlois, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Langlois, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Inst & Polit Econ Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Richard.Langlois@UConn.edu,,,,,,,63,5,5,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

There is extensive research on the subject, where each city is treated symmetrically in terms of the cost of transactions with other cities. Recent developments in network theory facilitate the examination of an asymmetric transport network. In a scale-free network, the chance of observing extremes in network connections becomes higher than the Gaussian distribution predicts and, therefore, it explains the emergence of large clusters. The city-size distribution shares the same pattern. This paper decodes how accessibility of a city to other cities on the transportation network can boost its local economy and explains the city-size distribution as a result of its underlying transportation network structure.

We find more equilibrium choices in the sequential version than in the simultaneous version of the game and we highlight the importance of attentional measures. Indeed, depending on the treatment, equilibrium behavior is 30 to 80 percentage points higher for subjects who look at all the payoffs necessary to compute the Nash equilibrium and for those who look at payoffs in the order predicted by the sequential elimination of dominated strategies than for subjects who do not. Finally, the sequence of lookups reveals that subjects have an easier time finding the player with a dominant strategy in the sequential timing than in the simultaneous timing. However, once this player is found, the unraveling logic of iterated elimination of dominated strategies is performed (equally) fast and efficiently under both timings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Estimated elasticities are larger in the top 1% of the income distribution but are also positive and statistically significant for other income groups. Previous time series studies of tax returns data have found little evidence for income responses to taxes outside the top of the income distribution. The different results in this article arise because of additional efforts to account for dynamics, expectations, and especially the endogeneity of tax policy decisions. Marginal rate cuts lead to increases in real GDP and declines in unemployment. There is also evidence that the responses are to marginal tax rates rather than average tax rates. Counterfactual tax cuts targeting the top 1% alone are estimated to have short-run positive effects on economic activity and incomes outside of the top 1%, but to increase inequality in pretax incomes. Cuts for taxpayers outside of the top 1% also lead to increases in incomes and economic activity, but with a longer delay.","[Mertens, Karel] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; Columbia Univ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Columbia University,"Mertens, K (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",,"Olea, Jose L.

In the case of deterministic demand and constant marginal cost, reducing a price cap yields increased total output, consumer welfare, and total welfare, results consistent with those for oligopoly markets with a fixed number of firms. With deterministic demand and increasing marginal cost, these comparative static results may be fully reversed, and a welfare-improving cap may not exist. Recent results in the literature show that for a fixed number of firms, if demand is stochastic and marginal cost is constant, then lowering a price cap may either increase or decrease output and welfare (locally); however, a welfare-improving price cap does exist. In contrast to these recent results, we show that a welfare-improving cap may not exist if entry is endogenous. However, within this stochastic demand environment we show that certain restrictions on the curvature of demand are sufficient to ensure the existence of a welfare-improving cap when entry is endogenous.","[Reynolds, Stanley S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rietzke, David] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England",University of Arizona; Lancaster University,"Reynolds, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",reynolds@eller.arizona.edu; d.rietzke@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Rietzke, David/0000-0002-8108-1396",,,,,17,12,13,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Using a variation of 'better response' strategies, IEL agents quickly learn to play Nash equilibrium strategies and their dynamic behavior is like that of humans subjects. In this paper we study whether IEL can also explain behavior in games with gains from coordination. We focus on the simplest such game: the 2 person repeated Battle of Sexes game. In laboratory experiments, two patterns of behavior often emerge: players either converge rapidly to one of the stage game Nash equilibria and stay there or learn to coordinate their actions and alternate between the two Nash equilibria every other round. We show that IEL explains this behavior if the human subjects are truly in the dark and do not know or believe they know their opponent's payoffs. To explain the behavior when agents are not in the dark, we need to modify the basic IEL model and allow some agents to begin with a good idea about how to play. We show that if the proportion of inspired agents with good ideas is chosen judiciously, the behavior of IEL agents looks remarkably similar to that of human subjects in laboratory experiments.","[Arifovic, Jasmina] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Ledyard, John] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Simon Fraser University; California Institute of Technology,"Arifovic, J (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",arifovic@sfu.ca; jledyard@caltech.edu,,,CIGI-INET Grant [5553]; Moore Foundation [1158],CIGI-INET Grant; Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation),"We thank Sarah Deretic, Kevin James, Brian Merlob and Heng Sok for their excellent research assistance.

We show that a nonlinear relationship and structural breaks exists between oil returns and various rare disaster risks; hence, linear Granger causality tests are misspecified and the linear model results of non-predictability are unreliable. However, the quantile-causality test shows that rare disaster-risks strongly affect both WTI returns and volatility, with stronger evidence of predictability observed at lower quantiles of the respective conditional distributions. Our results are robust to alternative specification of volatility (based on a GARCH model), and measure of rare disaster risks (based on the number of crises). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This generates a potential role for public old-age pension systems to spread economic and demographic shocks among different generations.

We use reductions in the variance of wealth equivalents to measure performance, starting with the existing U.S. system as a unifying framework, in which we vary how much taxes and benefits adjust, and which we then compare to the existing German and Swedish systems. We find that system design and shock type are key factors. The German system and the benefit-adjustment-only U.S. system best smooth productivity shocks, which are by far the most important shocks. Overall, the German system performs best, while the Swedish system, which includes a buffer stock to relax annual budget constraints, performs rather poorly. Focusing on the U.S. system, reliance solely on tax adjustment fares best for mortality and migration shocks, while equal reliance on tax and benefit adjustments is best for fertility shocks.

We refer to these episodes as stagnation traps, because they consist in the joint occurrence of a liquidity and a growth trap. In a stagnation trap, the central bank is unable to restore full employment because weak growth depresses aggregate demand and pushes the policy rate against the zero lower bound, while growth is weak because low aggregate demand results in low profits, limiting firms' investment in innovation. Aggressive policies aiming at restoring growth, such as subsidies to investment, can successfully lead the economy out of a stagnation trap by generating a regime shift in agents' growth expectations.","[Benigno, Gianluca] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England; [Benigno, Gianluca] CFM, Paris, France; [Fornaro, Luca] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Fornaro, Luca] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Barcelona School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Benigno, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England.;Benigno, G (通讯作者)，CFM, Paris, France.",,"Fornaro, Luca/L-2744-2014",,"ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship [ES/I024174/1]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-23192]; Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]; European Central Bank; ESRC [ES/R009295/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); European Central Bank; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the Editor, Gita Gopinath, four anonymous referees, Philippe Aghion, Pierpaolo Benigno, Javier Bianchi, Seonghoon Cho, Roger Farmer, Andrea Ferrero, Jordi Gali, Jang-Ting Guo, Bob Hall, Chad Jones, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Robert Kollmann, Tommaso Monacelli, Jaume Ventura, Alwyn Young, and participants at several seminars and conferences for useful comments.

To solve a discrete problem with n states and n choices, the algorithm requires at most nlog(2)(n)+5n objective function evaluations. In contrast, existing methods for nonconcave problems require n(2) evaluations in the worst case. For concave problems, the solution technique can be combined with a method exploiting concavity to reduce evaluations to 14n+2log(2)(n). A version of the algorithm exploiting monotonicity in two-state variables allows for even more efficient solutions. The algorithm can also be efficiently employed in a common class of problems that do not have monotone policies, including problems with many state and choice variables. In the sovereign default model of Arellano (2008) and in the real business cycle model, the algorithm reduces run times by an order of magnitude for moderate grid sizes and orders of magnitude for larger ones. Sufficient conditions for monotonicity and code are provided.","[Gordon, Grey; Qiu, Shi] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Gordon, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",greygordon@gmail.com; shiqiu@indiana.edu,,,,,,,36,1,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Using administrative data, Guvenen et al. (2015) document several new facts about the distribution of earnings growth, most notably large negative skewness and high excess kurtosis, rejecting the frequently used log-normal framework. I show that these new facts can be well explained by a standard structural representation of a frictional labor market, a life-cycle version of the job ladder model, in combination with a simple human capital process. Furthermore, I identify endogenous search effort, risk aversion and wealth accumulation, and skill loss in unemployment as key model features that interact with the labor market friction to jointly reconcile the evidence.

When shared diagnostic capacity is rationed based on reports of symptoms, the decision to report symptoms or not creates a trade-off. On the one hand, rigorous testing of one's locality allows the health agency in that locality to make an informed disease control decision. On the other hand, reducing the availability of diagnostic capacity for the other localities increases the probability that the disease will spread from an untested area where the disease is not controlled in the absence of more evidence of an outbreak. Symptoms are over-reported (respectively, reported truthfully, or under-reported) when the cost of disease control is sufficiently small (respectively, in some intermediate range, or sufficiently large). The rates of reporting suspicions decrease as the cost of disease control increases because the localities remain exposed more often and the health agencies prefer to reduce the risk of disease transmission by letting other agencies become informed. If the disease incidence decreases or infectiousness increases, symptoms are reported less frequently. If the precision of private signals increases, the extent of over-reporting of symptoms may increase. For different values of the parameters it can be socially optimal to subsidize or tax requests for additional investigations and confirmatory testing.","[Saak, Alexander E.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K ST NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University,"Saak, AE (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K ST NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",asaak@cgiar.org; hennes64@anr.msu.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Automation displaces the type of labor it directly affects, depressing its wage. Through ripple effects, automation also affects the real wage of other workers. Counteracting these forces, automation creates a positive productivity effect, pushing up the price of all factors.

We use disaggregated export volume data for 45 Indian industries over the period 1990-2013, as well as industry specific international relative prices, for estimation. Our results indicate that Indian exports are sensitive to international relative-price competitiveness, world demand, and energy shortages. In addition, binding supply-side constraints (notably energy shortages) dampen price responsiveness in the short-term. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

We access a rarely studied U.S. bank-level regulatory dataset to assess at a quarterly frequency how changes in the U.S. Federal funds rate (before the crisis) and quantitative easing (after the onset of the crisis) affect changes in cross-border claims by U.S. banks across countries, maturities and sectors, and also affect changes in claims by their foreign affiliates. We find robust evidence consistent with the existence of a potent global bank lending channel. In response to changes in U.S. monetary conditions, U.S. banks strongly adjust their cross-border claims in both the pre- and post-crisis period.

First, product partition model-K-means (PPM-KM) model is used to detect change points in the oil price sequence. Next, we apply a time-varying transition probability Markov regime switching (TVTP-MRS) model to identify the regime-switching characteristic. Then, we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to filtrate main determinants at each regime. Finally, the time-varying parameter structure time series model (TVP-STSM) is used to decompose the oil sequence, capture the time-variation of coefficients in volatile upward regime, and forecast the crude oil price. Compared with some other competing models and benchmark model of ARIMA, the newly proposed method shows superior forecasting ability in four statistical tests. Besides, we make scenario prediction on WTI crude oil price to examine the implementation effect of OPEC cut-off agreement at the end of 2016. OPEC production and U.S. shale oil production are used as two scenario variables, and the WTI price is forecasted fluctuating around 50 dollar/barrel based on three scenario prediction. We conclude that WTI crude oil price would take a shock upstream tendency in the short-term but the rising scope would not be large. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

With rising greener customer expectations and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, green supply chains are now viewed as another competitive weapon. Green supply chains are characterized by higher complexity and turbulence. Green supply chain flexibility can aid organizations function in this complex and uncertain environment, yet investigation into this area is very limited. This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs' green flexibility support capability. The results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets. This paper also identifies study limitations and future research directions for green supply chain flexibility.","[Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Bai, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,"Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014; Bai, Chunguang April/E-3296-2012","Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X; Bai, Chunguang April/0000-0002-9461-1632","National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71772032).",,70,15,15,2,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This distinction seems to be appealing for regulators. During the last decades, public utilities such as water and electricity have witnessed a wave of regulatory reforms aimed at improving efficiency through incentive regulation. Most of these regulation schemes use benchmarking, namely measuring companies' efficiency and rewarding them accordingly. Focusing on electricity distribution, we sketch a theoretical model to show that an imperfectly informed regulator may not disentangle the two parts of the cost efficiency. Therefore, the regulator may fail to set optimal efficiency targets, which also undermines quality. We then provide evidence on the presence of persistent and transient efficiency using data on 28 New Zealand electricity distribution companies between 2000 and 2011. First, we estimate a total cost function by means of traditional stochastic frontier models for panel data. These come up with an estimation of the persistent part or the transient part of the cost efficiency. Finally, we use the more recent generalized true random effects model that allows for the simultaneous estimation of both transient and persistent efficiency. We also find some evidence that persistent efficiency is associated to higher quality, and wrong efficiency targets are associated to lower quality compliance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find positive effects on the wages of low-skilled non-migrants and overall positive effects on employment. The gains partially offset the sharp drop in remittances in the observed period. An important part of the employment gains are concentrated in the agricultural sector, where most return migrants engage in self-employment and entrepreneurship.

Stimulated by these developments, there has been rapid progress in data and methods for measuring GVC linkages. The macro approach to measuring GVCs connects national input-output tables across borders by using bilateral trade data to construct global input-output tables. These tables have been applied to measure trade in value added, the length of and location of producers in GVCs, and price linkages across countries. The micro approach uses firm-level data to document firms' input sourcing decisions, how import and export participation are linked, and how multinational firms organize their production networks. In this review, I evaluate progress in these two approaches, highlighting points of contact between them and areas that demand further work. I argue that further convergence between these approaches can strengthen both, yielding a more complete empirical portrait of GVCs.","[Johnson, Robert C.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Johnson, Robert C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",robert.c.johnson@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,107,97,100,26,145,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We highlight the impact of horizontal and vertical power through their interaction effects with transparency and disclosure (TD) practices on fixed investments and performance in Russian firms. We find that TD and horizontal power or connectedness are substitutes, while whereas TD and vertical power are complements in their effects on fixed investment and firm performance.

We use administrative data to motivate three approaches to causal inference. The marginal propensity to consume SNAP-eligible food (MPCF) out of SNAP benefits is 0.5 to 0.6.

The model generates a rich set of predictions including productivity cut-offs for formal and informal firms to operate within different industries. We allow fixed costs to vary across industries, resulting in overlapping productivity distributions between formal and informal firms in the aggregate, but strict duality within industries. In doing so, we are able to generate and test predictions with regard to heterogeneity in informality across industries for the case of Indian manufacturing establishments. Consistent with the model, we find that the overlap between formal and informal establishments in the aggregate is larger than the overlaps within industries. Informality tends to decrease with average industry productivity and establishment size. Finally, more productive industries have greater overlaps in productivity between formal and informal establishments.","[Allen, Jeffrey] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, 185 Adamian Acad Ctr, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Nataraj, Shanthi] RAND Corp, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Schipper, Tyler C.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Bentley University; RAND Corporation; University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Schipper, TC (通讯作者)，Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",jeffallen19@gmail.com; snataraj@rand.org; schi0195@stthomas.edu,,"Schipper, Tyler/0000-0002-3987-0981",,,,,25,11,12,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Motivated by mounting evidence of the historical persistence of institutions and behavior, this paper studies the historical origins of this health variation. We examine the long-term consequences of the Protestant medical missionary enterprise that spread throughout India in the nineteenth century. Protestant mission medicine sought to place itself within non-European social and institutional milieus, contributing to the diffusion of Western medicine among the local population. We construct a novel fully geocoded dataset that combines contemporary individual-level data with historical information on missionary activities. We document a robust positive association between proximity to a Protestant medical mission and current individuals' health outcomes. Our analysis indicates that this long-run link is not driven by religious conversion or persistence of infrastructure, but possibly by improvements in individuals' health potential and changes in hygiene and health habits.","[Calvi, Rossella] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Mantovanelli, Federico G.] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA",Rice University; Analysis Group Inc.,"Calvi, R (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",rossella.calvi@rice.edu; federico.mantovanelli@analysisgroup.com,,,,,,,94,24,25,0,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In addition to permanent damages to public and private capital, the disaster causes temporary losses of productivity, inefficiencies during the reconstruction process, and damages to the sovereign's creditworthiness. We use the model to study the debt sustainability concerns that arise from the need to fully rebuild public infrastructure over the medium term and analyze the feasibility of ex ante policies, such as building adaptation infrastructure and fiscal buffers, and contrast these policies with the post-disaster support provided by donors. Investing in resilient infrastructure may prove useful, in particular if it is viewed as complementary to standard infrastructure, because it raises the marginal product of private capital, crowding in private investment, while helping withstand the impact of the natural disaster. In an application to Vanuatu, we find that donors should provide an additional 50% of pre-cyclone GDP in grants to be spent over the following 15 years to ensure public debt remains sustainable following Cyclone Pam. Helping the government build resilience on the other hand, reduces the risk of debt distress and at lower cost for donors.","[Marto, Ricardo] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Papageorgiou, Chris; Klyuev, Vladimir] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Pennsylvania; International Monetary Fund,"Marto, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Papageorgiou, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",rmarto@sas.upenn.edu; cpapageorgiou@imf.org; vklyuev@imf.org,,"Klyuev, Vladimir/0000-0002-0697-1444",U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID),U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID),"We thank the Editor Andrew Foster, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants in various conferences for their suggestions.

Evaluating the details of this reluctance is hampered by limited data. I use household scanner data to estimate food purchase response to a diagnosis of diabetes. I use a machine learning approach to infer diagnosis from purchases of diabetes-related products. On average, households show significant, but relatively small, calorie reductions. These reductions are concentrated in unhealthy foods, suggesting they reflect real efforts to improve diet. There is some heterogeneity in calorie changes across households, although this heterogeneity is not well predicted by demographics or baseline diet, despite large correlations between these factors and diagnosis. I suggest a theory of behavior change that may explain the limited overall change and the fact that heterogeneity is not predictable.","[Oster, Emily] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, 64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Oster, Emily] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Oster, E (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, 64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02906 USA.;Oster, E (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",emily_ostor@brown.edu,,,,,,,25,30,35,4,27,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

We use the model to construct indexes of firm-level demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in all three dimension with demand being the most dispersed. The firm-specific demand and marginal cost components account for over 30% of market share variation, 40% of sales variation, and over 50% of price variation among exporters. The fixed cost index is the primary factor explaining differences in the pattern of destination markets across firms. The estimates are used to analyse the supply reallocation following the removal of the quota on Chinese footwear exports to the EU. This led to a rapid restructuring of export supply sources on both the intensive and extensive margins in favour of firms with high demand and low fixed costs indexes, with marginal cost differences not being important.","[Roberts, Mark J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Roberts, Mark J.; Xu, Daniel Yi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Daniel Yi] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Fan, Xiaoyan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shengxing] London Sch Econ, London, England",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Fudan University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES-1125963]; ESRC [ES/P004237/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Amit Khandelwal, Jan De Loecker, the editor Stephane Bonhomme, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

This slowdown in the rate of decline is puzzling in light of evidence that the performance of microprocessor units (MPUs) has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Over the course of the 2000s, the MPU prices posted by Intel, the dominant producer of MPUs, became much stickier over the chips' life cycle. As a result of this change, we argue that the matched-model methodology used in the PPI for MPUs likely started to be biased after the early 2000s and that hedonic indexes can provide a more accurate measure of price change since then. MPU prices fell rapidly through 2004 on every price measure we present, with the PPI declining at an even quicker pace than the hedonic indexes. However, from 2004 to 2009, our preferred hedonic index fell faster than the PPI, and from 2009 to 2013 the gap widened further, with our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 42 percent, while the PPI declined at only a 6 percent rate. Given that MPUs currently represent about half of U.S. shipments of semiconductors, this difference has important implications for gauging the rate of innovation in the semiconductor sector.","[Byrne, David M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sichel, Daniel E.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Sichel, Daniel E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Byrne, DM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, 21st & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",david.m.byrne@frb.gov,,"Byrne, David/0000-0001-8226-5181",,,,,41,11,12,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Our framework allows for incentives to be either rewards or punishments. For our basic model we obtain a unique equilibrium, which typically involves randomization by both principals. Greater similarity between principals leads to more aggressive competition. The principals weakly prefer punishment to rewards, sometimes strictly. With rewards an agent voluntarily joins both groups; with punishment it depends on whether severe punishments are feasible and cheap for the principals. We study whether introducing an attractive compromise reduces competition between principals. Our framework of imperfect monitoring offers a natural perturbation of the standard common agency model of menu auctions, which results in sharper equilibrium predictions. The limit equilibrium prediction provides support to both truthful equilibria and the competing notion of natural equilibria, which unlike the former may be inefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

For instance, a retailer might raise the retail price of an item just before a sale and then promote the product by listing the initial price as the sales price. This paper addresses the question under what conditions would a firm give such a 'false' promotion and with what regularity? with an analytical model composed of two competing retailers and two segments of consumers. The duopoly firms sell substitutable products in a finite number of periods to consumers. In each period, each firm can choose to offer a real promotion, a false promotion, or no promotion. One segment of consumers is sophisticated and is able to discern false promotions based on the two firms' promotional offerings. The other segment of consumers is naive and trusts each firm's claimed promotional offering. Sophisticated consumers pass information on the existence of false promotions via word-of-mouth (WOM) to a fraction of naive consumers. We find that the possibility of offering false promotions can improve the payoffs for both firms, especially when the market is more competitive. Moreover, even when consumers can identify that a firm is offering a false promotion and pass this information to others, a firm still finds it optimal to offer such promotions from time to time. In general, the firm is more likely to offer false promotions in an environment with lower competition, fewer sophisticated consumers, and weaker WOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of market entry deterrence, but deterrence impact depends on the specific type of codesharing between market incumbents as well as the identity of the potential entrant.

We conduct a case study of environmental policy in India, focusing on unprecedented Supreme Court rulings that targeted industrial pollution in the Ganga River. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the rulings precipitated reductions in river pollution and one-month infant mortality, both of which persist for more than a decade. We then estimate a pollution-mortality dose-response function across twenty-nine rivers in the Ganga Basin, instrumenting for pollution with its upstream counterpart. The estimation reveals a significant external health burden of river pollution, not just in the district of measurement, but also on downstream communities. It further provides suggestive evidence that reducing pollution was an important driver behind declines in infant mortality observed after the rulings.","[Quy-Toan Do] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Joshi, Shareen] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Stolper, Samuel] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Do, QT (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, MSN MC3-306 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Stolper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Dana Bldg,Room 3006,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",Qdo@worldbank.org; shareen.joshi@georgetown.edu; samuel.stolper@gmail.com,,"Stolper, Samuel/0000-0001-7250-8039",,,,,51,28,32,3,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Specifically, what effects does introducing electricity and rate-mass allowance trade between differently-regulated regions have on emissions and ultimately welfare? We explore these questions first with a simple theoretical model and then with a sophisticated numerical model of the electricity sector. The theoretical model isolates the policy effects by assuming that two otherwise identical regions are regulated differently. With fixed demand, their autarky marginal abatement costs are identical, but electricity prices are lower in the rate-limited region. Adding electricity trade shifts generation to the rate limited region, expanding its allowance allocation, while emissions remain capped in the mass-capped region. Adding rate-mass allowance trade exacerbates this shift in generation and expansion of emissions. The increase of emission damage could make the net welfare effects negative. However, if the mass cap is sufficiently more stringent than the rate limit, allowing rate-mass allowance trade in the presence of electricity trade can lower emissions. The numerical model of the eastern US illustrates the effects predicted in the theoretical model, and projects their magnitudes. In our simulation that is loosely based on the US Clean Power Plan, the estimated CO2 damage makes the estimated net benefits of allowing rate-mass trading negative. Our results also illustrate that linking can shift the geographic distribution of SO2 and NOx emissions, which can counteract the effect of the CO2 damage on estimated total welfare.

The optimal UI replacement rate is the conventional Baily-Chetty replacement rate, which solves the trade-off between insurance and job-search incentives, plus a correction term, which is positive when an increase in UI pushes the labor market tightness toward its efficient level. In matching models, most wage mechanisms do not ensure efficiency, so tightness is generally inefficient. The effect of UI on tightness depends on the model: increasing UI may raise tightness by alleviating the rat race for jobs or lower tightness by increasing wages through bargaining.","[Landais, Camille] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Michaillat, Pascal] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Brown University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Landais, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.landais@lse.ac.uk; pascal_michaillat@brown.edu; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Michaillat, Pascal/0000-0003-2381-7470","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K008641/1]; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC [ES/K008641/1, ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This work was supported by the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/K008641/1), the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and the Sandler Foundation.",,40,46,48,1,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

We combine new data on oil and gas endowments with Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms affect local economies in the U.S. Local wages rise during oil and gas booms, but manufacturing is not crowded out-in fact, the sector grows overall, driven by upstream and locally-traded subsectors. Tradable manufacturing subsectors do contract during resource booms, but their productivity is unaffected, so there is no evidence of foregone local learning-by-doing effects. Over the full 1969-2014 sample, a county with one standard deviation additional oil and gas endowment averaged about 1% higher real wages.

This particularly holds for interactive designs. In this paper, we provide a methodological discussion of the similarities and differences between interactive experiments conducted in the laboratory and online. To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation. We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment. We conclude that data quality for interactive experiments via the Internet is adequate and reliable, making online interactive experimentation a potentially valuable complement to laboratory studies.","[Arechar, Antonio A.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA; [Gaechter, Simon; Molleman, Lucas] Univ Nottingham, CeDEx, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Gaechter, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Gaechter, Simon] CESifo, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Gaechter, Simon] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Molleman, Lucas] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Yale University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Max Planck Society,"Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CeDEx, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，CESifo, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",antonio.alonso@yale.edu; simon.gaechter@nottingham.ac.uk; molleman@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,"Gachter, Simon/C-9787-2009","Gachter, Simon/0000-0002-7182-8505; Alonso Arechar, Antonio/0000-0002-2537-8830",ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (NIBS) [ES/K002201/1]; European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant [295707]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [295707] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (NIBS); European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Thorsten Chmura, David Cooper, Dennie van Dolder, Urs Fischbacher, Marcus Giamattei, Roberto Hernan Gonzalez, Oliver Hauser, Susie Jackson, Daniele Nosenzo, Charles Noussair, David G.

Without a source of quasi-experimental variation in local crime, we develop an identification strategy that leverages a recently developed test of exogeneity (Caetano (2015)) to select a feasible regression model for causal inference. Using a detailed incident-based data set of all reported crimes in Dallas from 2000 to 2007, we find some evidence of dynamic spillovers within certain types of crimes, but no evidence that lighter crimes cause more severe crimes. This suggests that a range of crime reduction policies that target lighter crimes (prescribed, for instance, by the broken windows theory of crime) should not be credited with reducing the violent crime rate. Our strategy involves a systematic investigation of endogeneity concerns and is particularly useful when rich data allow for the estimation of many regression models, none of which is agreed upon as causal ex ante.","[Caetano, Gregorio] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Maheshri, Vikram] Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Rochester; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Caetano, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",gregorio.caetano@gmail.com; vmaheshri@uh.edu,"Caetano, Gregorio S/A-6526-2019",,,,,,51,10,11,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

To address this important policy question, we formulate a sequential game where a superintendent is tasked with closing down a certain percentage of student capacity; parents respond to these school closings by sorting into the remaining schools. We estimate parents' preferences for each school in their choice set using 4 years of student-level data from a mid-sized district with declining enrollments. We show that consideration of student sorting is vital to the assessment of any school closing policy. We next consider a superintendent tasked with closing excess school capacity, recognizing that students will sort into the remaining schools. Some students will inevitably respond to school closings by exiting the public school system; it is especially difficult to retain higher achieving students when closing public schools. We find that superintendents confront a difficult dilemma: pursuing an equity objective, such as limiting demographic stratification across schools, results in the exit of many more students than are lost by an objective explicitly based on student retention.","[Epple, Dennis] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Epple, Dennis; Sieg, Holger] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jha, Akshaya] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sieg, Holger] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Pennsylvania,"Epple, D (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Epple, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",epple@andrew.cmu.edu; akshayaj@andrew.cmu.edu; holgers@econ.upenn.edu,,"Epple, Dennis/0000-0002-7354-5728",Institute of Education Sciences [IES R305A070117],Institute of Education Sciences(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)),"We would like to thank the editor of the journal, three anonymous referees, Lanier Benkard, Eric Bettinger, Flavio Cunha, John Engberg, Kirill Evdokimov, David Figlio, Eric Hanushek, Dave Marcotte, Francois Margot, Mark Rosenzweig, Petra Todd, Frank Wolak, and seminar participants at various universities and conferences for comments.

Absent a central authority, voluntary arrangements must replace coercive ones, and significant under-provision must be expected. International public goods are particularly challenging due to the substantial asymmetries among nations. Small-interest nations have strong incentives to ride cheaply. Our empirical results reveal cheap riding intentions in providing for climate change mitigation, a critical international public good. The evidence is provided by individual nations' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions voluntarily pledged for the Paris Climate Change Conference. We find that larger nations made much larger pledges in proportion to both their Gross National Incomes and their historical emissions. Implications for the Nordhaus Climate Club and carbon-tax proposals are discussed. To achieve Pareto optimality despite disparate cheap riding incentives, we propose the Cheap-Riding Efficient equilibrium.

Using a firm-level panel, this article econometrically investigates the relationship between financialization and investment, exploring the implications of changes in financing behavior, increasingly entrenched shareholder value norms and rising firm-level demand volatility for NFC investment in the U.S. economy between 1971 and 2013. Shareholder value orientation is, in particular, identified as a characteristic of the post-1970 U.S. economy associated with a statistically and economically significant decline in NFC investment rates. The stock of financial assets, conversely, is found to be a positive correlate of firm investment. The analysis also highlights key differences by firm size. In particular, shareholder value norms are found to primarily influence the investment behavior of large NFCs, while rising volatility most substantially impacts small firms.","[Davis, Leila E.] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, 402 Warner Hall, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Davis, LE (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, 402 Warner Hall, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",ldavis@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,41,83,91,14,103,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2018,69,1,,,,,270,307,,10.1111/meca.12179,0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FR5HG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000419096900015,0

Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that overall matching efficiency declined smoothly over the period from 2001 through 2013.

Based on employer and university interviews, I develop a model describing firms' choice of target campuses. The model predicts that with costly screening, firms concentrate (per student) at selective universities over those where high-quality students are larger in number, but smaller in proportion. Further, recruiting is affected by nearby universities' selectivity. This prediction has strong support using data from 39 finance and consulting firms and the Baccalaureate and Beyond. For median-selectivity universities, a better regionally-ranked university is twice as likely to attract a consulting firm, and wages are higher by 4%. Halving screening costs, for example through algorithmic screening, structural estimation shows a 27% increase in the proportion of expected hires from universities outside the top selectivity quartile.","[Weinstein, Russell] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Weinstein, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",weinst@illinois.edu,,,,,,,53,4,5,2,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55,,,,,,282,299,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.10.007,0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000454465000016,0

Our second set of treatments evaluates neologism-proofness from an evolutionary perspective in the absence of a common language. We find that the proportion of observations in which the meaning of a neologism evolves to disrupt a prevailing fully revealing equilibrium is lower when the equilibrium is neologism-proof.

Furthermore, the results show that the stock and CDS markets are net transmitters of volatility, while foreign exchange and bond markets are net receivers of the spillovers.

At the intertemporal margin, there is a novel incentive for introducing distortions that can lead to an ex-ante capital subsidy. Overall, optimal policy calls for a much stronger use of debt returns as a fiscal absorber, leading to the conclusion that actual fiscal policy is even worse than we thought.","[Karantounias, Anastasios G.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Karantounias, AG (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",,,"Karantounias, Anastasios/0000-0003-0315-8535",,,,,47,5,12,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Fairness principles sometimes provide immediate recommendations about the relative weights to assign to various income ranges, but in general require a careful choice of utility representations embodying the relevant interpersonal comparisons.

We also see wider implications for household economic welfare, demonstrated by reduced self-reported financial distress, better resilience to economic shocks, and a greater capacity to securing basic needs. We argue that program impact may run through three effect channels, namely improved self-efficacy, higher family and community social support, and greater optimism.

In a large online sample, we replicate the seminal finding that cheating rates are largely insensitive to stake size, even at a 500-fold increase. We present two new findings. First, resisting the temptation to cheat at high stakes led to negative moral spill-over, triggering a moral license: participants who resisted cheating in the high stakes condition subsequently donated a smaller fraction of their earnings to charity. Second, participants who cheated maximally mispredicted their perceived morality: although such participants thought they were less prone to feeling immoral if they cheated, they ended up feeling more immoral a day after the cheating task than immediately afterwards. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings on moral balancing and self-deception, and the practical relevance for organisational design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This is at odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained with our simple formula.","[Berger, David; Lorenzoni, Guido] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Guerrieri, Veronica; Vavra, Joseph] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago,"Berger, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,56,120,149,14,140,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This practice is partly motivated by the stronger implication derived by Lee (2008), who showed that under certain conditions the distribution of baseline covariates in the RDD must be continuous at the cut-off. We propose a permutation test based on the so-called induced ordered statistics for the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of baseline covariates at the cut-off; and introduce a novel asymptotic framework to analyse its properties. The asymptotic framework is intended to approximate a small sample phenomenon: even though the total number n of observations may be large, the number of effective observations local to the cut-off is often small. Thus, while traditional asymptotics in RDD require a growing number of observations local to the cut-off as n -> 8, our framework keeps the number q of observations local to the cut-off fixed as n -> 8. The new test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weak conditions, exhibits finite sample validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic validity, and has favourable power properties relative to tests based on means. In a simulation study, we find that the new test controls size remarkably well across designs. We then use our test to evaluate the plausibility of the design in Lee (2008), a well-known application of the RDD to study incumbency advantage.","[Canay, Ivan A.; Kamat, Vishal] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Canay, IA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1530534]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1530534] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the Co-Editor and four anonymous referees for helpful comments.

In a setting that combines risky entrepreneurial activity with moral hazard, we find that a shift from autarky to financial integration leads to boom-bust cycles in capital flows, output and consumption. Moral hazard causes cycles because financial intermediaries incentivize effort by insisting entrepreneurs take an equity share in their own projects. The size of this stake rises with wealth, discouraging entrepreneurship and inhibiting capital formation. The reverse is true when wealth falls, generating cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Markets work best if they enjoy social support, but some markets are repugnant in the sense that some people think they should be banned, even though others want to participate in them. Laws banning such markets often contribute to the design of illegal black markets, and this raises new issues for market designers.

Due to biological disadvantages, patient populations of blood types B/O are disproportionately hurt by this increasing shortage. The disadvantaged blood types are overrepresented among minorities in the US. In order to mitigate the disproportionate harm to these biologically disadvantaged groups, the UNOS reformed in 2014 the US deceased-donor kidney-allocation system, utilizing a technological advance in blood typing. The improved technology allows a certain fraction of blood type A kidneys, referred to as subtype A2 kidneys, to be transplanted to medically qualified patients of blood types B/O. The recent reform prioritizes subtype A2 deceased-donor kidneys for blood type B patients only. When restricted to the deceased-donor allocation system, this is merely a distributional reform with no adverse impact on the overall welfare of the patient population. In this paper we show that the current implementation of the reform has an unintended consequence, and it de facto extends the preferential allocation to kidney exchange as well. Ironically this spillover not only reduces the number of living-donor transplants for the overall patient population, but also for the biologically disadvantaged groups who are the intended beneficiaries of the reform. We show that minor variations of the current policy do not suffer from this unintended consequence, and we make two easy-to-implement, welfare-increasing policy recommendations.

We first develop a model of school choice in which the demand for religious schooling is driven partly by the desire of parents to limit their children's exposure to the influences of competing religions. The model predicts that when a religious group's share of the local population grows, the fraction of that group's members whose children attend religious schools declines. In addition, it shows that if the motivation to preserve religious identity is sufficiently strong, the fraction of all children that attend a given denomination's school is an inverse u-shaped function of the denomination's market share. Finally, the model implies that the overall demand for religious schooling is an increasing function of both the local religiosity rate and the level of religious pluralism, as measured by a Herfindahl Index. Using both U.S. county-level data and individual data from ECLS-K and NELS:88, we find evidence strongly consistent with all of the model's predictions. Our findings also illustrate that failing to control for the local religiosity rate, as is common in previous studies, may lead a researcher to erroneously conclude that religious pluralism has a negative effect on participation.

We generalize a sufficient condition for existence of equilibrium due to Anesi and Seidmann (2015). We then use this existence result to show that if a weak gradient restriction holds at an alternative, then when players are sufficiently patient, there is a continuum of equilibria with absorbing sets arbitrarily close to that alternative. A sufficient condition for our gradient restriction is that the gradients of all players' utilities are linearly independent at that alternative. When the dimensionality of the set of alternatives is high, this linear independence condition holds at almost all alternatives, and equilibrium absorbing sets are dense in the set of alternatives. This implies that constructive techniques, which are common in the literature, fail to identify many plausible outcomes in dynamic bargaining games.","[Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Nottingham; University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk; dugg@ur.rochester.edu,,"Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594; Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,29,5,5,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper documents this pattern using Spanish data and builds a two-sector, dynamic quantitative model of sovereign default with capital accumulation. Recessions are very persistent in the model and more pronounced for nontraded sectors because of default risk. An adverse domestic shock increases the likelihood of default, limits capital inflows, and thus restricts the ability of the economy to exploit investment opportunities. The economy responds by reducing investment and reallocating capital toward the traded sector to support debt service payments. The real exchange rate depreciates, a reflection of the scarcity of traded goods. We find that these mechanisms are quantitatively important for rationalizing the experience of Spain during the recent debt crisis. (C) 2018 The Authors.

This paper fills this gap by exploring to what extent concentration of a country's non-resource export basket is determined by their exports of natural resources. We present a theoretical framework that shows how upward pressure in wages caused by a resource windfall results in higher export concentration. We then document two robust empirical findings consistent with the theory. First, using data on discovery of oil and gas fields and of commodity prices as sources of exogenous variation, we find that countries with larger shares of natural resources in exports have more concentrated non-resource export baskets. Second, we find capital-intensive exports tend to dominate the export basket of countries prone to Dutch disease episodes.","[Bahar, Dany] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bahar, Dany; Santos, Miguel A.] Harvard Ctr Int Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [Santos, Miguel A.] Inst Estudios Super Adm, Caracas, Venezuela",Brookings Institution; Institute of Advanced Studies in Administration (IESA),"Bahar, D (通讯作者)，1775 Massachusets Ave, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",db21@post.harvard.edu,,"Santos, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-1305-9477",,,,,32,41,45,3,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We first set up a model of collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign currency with international financial intermediation in which a change in leverage of global intermediaries leads to an international credit supply increase. In this environment, we illustrate how house price increases and exchange rates appreciations contribute to fueling the boom by inflating the value of collateral. We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock, and show that country differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of foreign currency denominated credit.

Our analysis produces new results that explain howthe rule governing the distribution of resources among household members is related to the measurement of household welfare and intra-household inequality. We show that in a collective model of private consumption, income shares are equal to the product of two weights: the Pareto weight and a distribution weight reflecting income effects across individuals. For a weighted Bergsonian representation of household utility and general assumptions about individual preferences, we derive the associated household welfare functions and intra-household inequality measures belonging to a family of entropy indexes. We illustrate our findings with an empirical application that estimates a collective demand system to recover associated individual and household welfare functions along with the measures of intra-household inequality.

In every period until its discovery, the players decide how much of the unsearched area to comb. If a player finds the prize alone he wins it and the game ends. Players have a per-period discount factor and costs proportional to the area they search. First, as a benchmark for efficiency, we solve the one-player search problem. Second, in the two-player setting we show that typically there is inefficient over-search - a result akin to the tragedy of the commons. However, for players with intermediate levels of patience, there is the possibility of inefficient under-search as players incorporate the expected future payoffs in their current search decisions. Finally, with patient players, several counterintuitive results can arise: for example, players might be better off searching a larger island or looking for a less valuable prize.

The experimental data show that closeness in the division of preferences induces a significant increase in turnout. Moreover, for closely divided electorates (and only for these electorates), the provision of information significantly raises the participation of subjects supporting the slightly larger team relative to the smaller team. We show that the heterogeneous effect of information on the participation of subjects in different teams is driven by the subjects' (incorrect) beliefs of casting a pivotal vote. Simply put, subjects overestimate the probability of casting a pivotal vote when they belong to the team with a slight majority, and choose the strategy that maximizes their utility based on their inflated probability assessment. Empirical evidence on gubernatorial elections in the United States between 1990 and 2005 is consistent with our main experimental result. Namely, we observe that the difference in the actual vote tally between the party leading according to the polls and the other party is larger than the one predicted by the polls only in closely divided electorates.

We find that layoff leads to a considerable reduction in the probability of employment while in school, but it has little impact on enrollment decisions at the extensive margin. On the intensive margin, we find that layoff leads to an increase in enrolled credits, consistent with the fact that the opportunity cost of college has decreased. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To provide a robust description of the literature's findings, we gather and analyze a metadata set of experiments on infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma games. The experimental data show that cooperation is affected by infinite repetition and is more likely to arise when it can be supported in equilibrium. However, the fact that cooperation can be supported in equilibrium does not imply that most subjects will cooperate. High cooperation rates will emerge only when the parameters of the repeated game are such that cooperation is very robust to strategic uncertainty. We also review the results regarding the effect of imperfect monitoring, changing partners, and personal characteristics on cooperation and the strategies used to support it.","[Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Frechette, Guillaume R.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Dal Bó, P (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Dal Bó, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,111,111,117,3,77,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Individuals are heterogeneous in two dimensions: productive ability in the private sector and negotiating ability in politics. When these are positively correlated, rich voters always prefer a rich legislator, but poor voters face a trade-off. A rich legislator will secure more pork for the district, but will also prefer lower taxation than the poor voter. Our theory organizes a number of stylized facts across countries about taxation and redistribution, parties, and class representation in legislatures. We demonstrate that spending does not necessarily increase when the number of legislators increases, as the standard common-pool intuition suggests, and that many policies aimed at increasing descriptive representation may have the opposite effect.","[Mattozzi, Andrea] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Mattozzi, Andrea] MOVE, Florence, Italy; [Snowberg, Erik] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Snowberg, Erik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Snowberg, Erik] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Snowberg, Erik] CESifo, Washington, DC USA",European University Institute; University of British Columbia; California Institute of Technology; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mattozzi, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.;Mattozzi, A (通讯作者)，MOVE, Florence, Italy.",Andrea.Mattozzi@EUl.eu; snowberg@caltech.edu,"Mattozzi, Andrea/H-2939-2014; Mattozzi, Andrea/JWP-2586-2024",,NSF [SES-1156154],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Jonathan Chapman for excellent research assistance.

FCMs have been shown to be particularly useful for handling complex decision problems characterized by lack of information or unavailable data.

First, the identification of the marginal effect requires a measure of at least one component of risk that cannot be diversified or avoided. Moreover, measures of uninsurable wage risk must vary over time to eliminate unobserved heterogeneity. Secondly, evaluating the economic significance of risk requires knowledge of the size of all the wage risk actually faced. Existing estimates are problematic because measures of wage risk fail to satisfy the 'non-avoidability' requirement. This creates a downward bias, which is at the root of the small estimated effect of wage risk on portfolio choices. To tackle this problem we match panel data of workers and firms and use the variability in the profitability of the firm that is passed over to workers to obtain a measure of uninsurable risk. Using this measure to instrument total variability in individual earnings, we find that the marginal effect of uninsurable wage risk is much larger than estimates that ignore endogeneity. We bound the economic impact of risk and find that its overall effect is contained, not because its marginal effect is small but because its size is small. And the size of uninsurable wage risk is small because firms provide substantial wage insurance.","[Fagereng, Andreas] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Guiso, Luigi] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, NBER, Stanford, CA USA; [Fagereng, Andreas] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Guiso, Luigi] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] SIEPR, Stanford, CA USA",Statistics Norway; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Statistics Norway; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Fagereng, A (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Fagereng, Andreas/0000-0002-0427-9737",Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway) [230843]; Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway) [230843],Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway)(Research Council of Norway); Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway)(Research Council of Norway),"We thank Sumit Agarwal, Adne Cappelen, Francis Vella, the editor, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

It makes 5 points. First, in the short run, the role of autonomous expenditure can be appreciated within a standard post Keynesian framework (Kaleckian, Kaldorian, Robinsonian, etc.). Second, and related to the first, the SSM model is a model of the long run and has to be evaluated as such. Third, in the long run, one way that capacity adjusts to demand is through an endogenous adjustment of the rate of utilization. Fourth, the SSM model is a peculiar way to reach what Garegnani called the second Keynesian position. Although, it respects the letter of the Keynesian hypothesis, it makes investment quasi-endogenous and subjects it to the growth of autonomous expenditure. Fifth, in the long run it is unlikely that autonomous expenditures is really autonomous. From a stock-flow consistent point of view this implies unrealistic adjustments after periods of changes in stock-flow ratios. Moreover, if we were to take this kind of adjustment at face value, there would be no space for Minskyan financial cycles. This also creates serious problems for the empirical validation of the model.","[Nikiforos, Michalis] Blithewood Bard Coll, Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12571 USA",,"Nikiforos, M (通讯作者)，Blithewood Bard Coll, Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12571 USA.",,,"Nikiforos, Michalis/0000-0003-1477-7593",,,,,56,32,33,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our theoretical framework suggests that inheritance rules shape filial obligations to parents, and thus the within-family intergenerational transmission of resources. In countries with egalitarian inheritance rules, inheriting children represent a large share of the population, and support generous pension systems; in countries with nonegalitarian inheritance rules, a majority of noninheriting individuals prefer basic pension systems. An empirical cross-country analyses using historical data on inheritance rules support these predictions. These results are robust to controlling for alternative legal, religious, demographic, economic, and political explanations. Evidence from individual (General Social Survey) data confirms our findings: US citizens whose ancestors came from countries featuring egalitarian inheritance rules rely more on the government as a provider of old age security income.","[Galasso, Vincenzo] Bocconi Univ, Dondena, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Profeta, Paola] Bocconi Univ, Dondena, Milan, Italy; [Galasso, Vincenzo] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Galasso, Vincenzo; Profeta, Paola] CESIfo, Munich, Germany",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut,"Galasso, V (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dondena, IGIER, Milan, Italy.",vincenzo.galasso@unibocconi.it; paola.profeta@unibocconi.it,"Galasso, Vincenzo/AFP-4222-2022","Galasso, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3882-0587","NETSPAR; Progetto MIUR-PRIN [2010T8XAXB_008, 2015FMRE5X]",NETSPAR; Progetto MIUR-PRIN,"We thank Filippo Mezzanotti, Massimo Pulejo and Michel Serafinelli for excellent research assistance.

We show that these emissions reductions are primarily driven by within-product changes in emissions intensity rather than changes in output or in the composition of products produced. We then develop and estimate a quantitative model linking trade with the environment to better understand the economic forces driving these changes. Our estimates suggest that the implicit pollution tax that manufacturers face doubled between 1990 and 2008. These changes in environmental regulation, rather than changes in productivity and trade, account for most of the emissions reductions.","[Shapiro, Joseph S.; Walker, Reed] Univ Calif Berkeley, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shapiro, Joseph S.; Walker, Reed] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Shapiro, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Shapiro, JS (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",joseph.shapiro@berkeley.edu; rwalker@berkeley.edu,,,NSF [SES-1530494]; Department of Energy; Sloan Foundation; National Bureau of Economic Research on the Economics of Energy Markets; Yale MacMillan Center; Yale Program on Applied Economics and Policy Research; Weyerhaeuser Research Grant from the Yale Center for Business and the Environment; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; UC Office of the President through the University of California Center for Energy and Environmental Economics,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

However, there is relatively little evidence on the long-run educational and labor market consequences of childhood peers. We examine this question by linking administrative data on elementary school students to subsequent test scores, college attendance and completion, and earnings. To distinguish the effect of peers from confounding factors, we exploit the population variation in the proportion of children from families linked to domestic violence, who have been shown to disrupt contemporaneous behavior and learning. Results show that exposure to a disruptive peer in classes of 25 during elementary school reduces earnings at age 24 to 28 by 3 percent. We estimate that differential exposure to children linked to domestic violence explains 5 percent of the rich-poor earnings gap in our data, and that each year of exposure to a disruptive peer reduces the present discounted value of classmates' future earnings by $80,000.","[Carrell, Scott E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carrell, Scott E.; Hoekstra, Mark; Kuka, Elira] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hoekstra, Mark] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 3087 Allen Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kuka, Elira] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, 3300 Dyer St, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Southern Methodist University,"Carrell, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Carrell, SE (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",secarrell@ucdavis.edu; markhoekstra@tamu.edu; ekuka@smu.edu,,"Hoekstra, Mark/0000-0002-1515-4219",UC Davis Center for Poverty Research,UC Davis Center for Poverty Research,"Carrell: Department of Economics, University of California-Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, and NBER (email: secarrell@ucdavis.edu); Hoekstra: Department of Economics, Texas A&M University, 3087 Allen Building, College Station, TX 77843, and NBER (email: markhoekstra@tamu.edu); Kuka: Department of Economics, Southern Methodist University, 3300 Dyer Street, Dallas, TX 75275, and NBER (email: ekuka@smu.edu).This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Marianne Bertrand, Coeditor.

We consider a finite population of loss-averse agents who are repeatedly and randomly matched to play a symmetric two-player normal form game. When an agent revises her strategy, she compares the payoff from each strategy to a reference point. Under the resulting dynamics, called prospect dynamics, risk-dominance is no longer sufficient to guarantee stochastic stability in 2 x 2 coordination games. We propose a stronger concept, loss-dominance: a strategy is loss-dominant if it is risk dominant and a maximin strategy. In 2 x 2 coordination games, the state where all agents play the loss-dominant strategy is uniquely stochastically stable under prospect dynamics for any degree of loss-aversion and all types of reference points. For symmetric two-player normal form games, a generalized concept, generalized loss-dominance, gives a sufficient condition for stochastic stability under prospect dynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We link parental education and family structure during childhood to male-female and brother-sister differences in adolescent outcomes, educational attainment, and adult earnings and employment. Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father's education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters). We conclude that differences in the behavior of school-aged boys and girls may be poor proxies for differences in skills that drive longer-term outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit the 1990s trade liberalization in Brazil as a natural experiment generating exogenous shocks to local economies. We document that regions exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a temporary increase in crime following liberalization. Next, we investigate through what channels the trade-induced economic shocks may have affected crime. We show that the shocks had significant effects on potential determinants of crime, such as labor market conditions, public goods provision, and income inequality. We propose a novel framework exploiting the distinct dynamic responses of these variables to obtain bounds on the effect of labor market conditions on crime.

By making information on program quality accessible to the public, QRIS attempts to alter parental preferences for quality-related attributes and encourage competition between providers. This paper draws on a variety of datasets to empirically characterize the way in which families and providers respond to the enactment of QRIS. Specifically, it exploits the differential timing in states' QRIS roll-out to examine two sets of outcomes: (i) families' child care choices and maternal employment and (ii) the supply and compensation of child care labor. Estimates from difference-in-differences models reveal several noteworthy findings. First, although QRIS induces families to shift from parental to non-parental care, economically disadvantaged families are more likely to use informal care, while their advantaged counterparts are more likely to use formal care. Second, QRIS increases the supply of high-skilled labor, particularly within the center-based sector. Third, all but the most highly-skilled child care workers experience rising compensation levels but also greater turnover. Finally, states that administer a wage compensation program alongside their QRIS experience larger increases in child care supply and compensation as well as lower turnover rates than states operating a QRIS in isolation.","[Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,35,10,15,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54,,,,,,172,190,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.007,0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000447577200011,0

Concave establishment-level responses of employment growth to total factor productivity shocks estimated from census data induce significant skewness, movements in volatility, and amplification of bad aggregate shocks.","[Ilut, Cosmin; Kehrig, Matthias] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ilut, Cosmin; Kehrig, Matthias; Schneider, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kehrig, Matthias; Schneider, Martin] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Schneider, Martin] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stanford University,"Ilut, C (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Ilut, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Texas Research Data Center from the National Science Foundation [ITR0427889],Texas Research Data Center from the National Science Foundation,"We thank Erik Hurst, four anonymous referees, and participants at many conferences and seminars for very helpful comments and suggestions.

In this paper, we present an agent based model (and a scalable approximation of it) in a closely related spirit. The central feature of this model is that wealth enables an individual to secure more wealth. Specifically, the important and novel feature of this model is its ability to simultaneously produce both the Pareto distribution observed in empirical data for the top 10% of the population and the exponential distribution observed for the lower 90%. We show that the model produces these distributions of wealth when initialized with an equitable distribution. Then, using historical data, we initialize the model with US wealth shares in 1988 and show that the model tracks wealth share changes from 1988 to 2012. Simulations to 2088 project that the top 0.01% of the population will possess more than 70% of the total wealth in the economy.","[Vallejos, Hunter A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nutaro, James J.; Perumalla, Kalyan S.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Nutaro, JJ (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",hunterandresvallejos@gmail.com; nutarojj@ornl.gov; perumallaks@ornl.gov,,"Vallejos, Hunter/0000-0003-4008-191X; Perumalla, Kalyan/0000-0002-7458-0832; Nutaro, James/0000-0001-7360-2836",,,,,11,4,6,2,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We prove that Markov-perfect insurance contracts preserve standard properties of optimal insurance with private information and are not more restrictive than a long-term contract with one-sided commitment. Markov-perfect contracts imply a determinate asset time-path and a non-degenerate long-run stationary wealth distribution. Quantitatively, we show that Markov-perfect risk-sharing contracts provide sizably more consumption smoothing relative to self-insurance and that the welfare gains from resolving the commitment friction are larger than the gains from resolving the moral hazard friction at low asset levels, while the opposite holds for high asset levels.

To address this question, we develop a general equilibrium model featuring two skill types, search frictions, wage bargaining, and a welfare state that redistributes income through unemployment benefits and the provision of public goods. Our quantitative analysis suggests that, in all 20 countries studied, immigration attenuates the effects of search frictions. The resulting gains tend to outweigh the welfare costs of redistribution. Immigration has increased native welfare in almost all countries. In two-thirds of countries, both high- and low-skilled natives have benefited from the presence of immigrants, contrary to what models without search frictions or redistribution predict. Average total welfare gains from migration are 1.25% and 1.00% for high- and low-skilled natives, respectively.

We show that for some policies, such as feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity, detailed representation of renewable resource grades is required to describe the technology more precisely and identify cost-effective policy designs. We demonstrate the hybrid approach for modeling heterogeneity in the quality of natural resource inputs required for renewable energy production in a stylized computable general equilibrium framework. Importantly, compared to the traditional approach, the hybrid approach resolves near-flat or near-vertical sections of the supply curve and improves the precision of policy simulation. We then represent the shape of a resource supply curve based on more detailed data. We show that for the case of onshore wind development in China, a differentiated feed-in tariff design that can only be modeled with the hybrid approach requires less than half of the subsidy budget needed for a uniform feed-in tariff design to achieve the same installation targets.

Using data on the prevalence of the mutation that causes sickle cell disease, we measure the impact of malaria on mortality in Africa prior to the period in which formal data were collected. Our estimate is that in the more afflicted regions, malaria lowered the probability of surviving to adulthood by about ten percentage points, which is twice the current burden of the disease. The reduction in malaria mortality has been roughly equal to the reduction in other causes of mortality. We then ask whether the estimated burden of malaria had an effect on economic development in the period before European contact. Using data at the ethnic group level, we find little evidence of a negative relationship between malaria burden and population density or other measures of development.","[Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Ciencia Polit, Santiago, Chile; [Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",davidweil@brown.edu,,"Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio/0000-0002-4236-7869",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,62,15,19,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

This important study established that the behavior in an incentivized trust game is not correlated with the responses to the most widely used survey measures of trust. We conduct a replication and a reinvestigation of GLSS. In the replication, we use the GLSS protocol and we reproduce their results. In the reinvestigation, we introduce one major change: We replace their variation of the standard Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995) investment game with the original unmodified game. The standard game endows both players, while the modified version endows only the first mover. After endowing both movers in the reinvestigation experiment, we find a significant correlation between the two measures, suggesting that trust is a single construct, whether measured by the survey questions or by an incentivized trust game.","[Aksoy, Billur; Kovaliukaite, Ada; Eckel, Catherine] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Harwell, Haley] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, 28 Westhampton Way,Jepson Hall, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Richmond,"Aksoy, B (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",billuraksoy@tamu.edu; hharwell@richmond.edu; kovaliuk@tamu.edu; ceckel@tamu.edu,,"Aksoy, Billur/0000-0003-0658-0440","Eckel's Sara and John Lindsey Professorship, College of Liberal Arts, Texas AM University","Eckel's Sara and John Lindsey Professorship, College of Liberal Arts, Texas AM University","We would like to thank David I.

To identify the effects we exploit the fact that the placement of physical barriers by Israel was exogenous to local labor market conditions. Check-points have a significant negative effect on employment, wages and days worked, while other barriers have small positive effects on employment and no discernible effects on other variables. We provide evidence that only a very small portion of these effects is due to direct restrictions on the mobility of workers.

However, in reality human preferences are often not transitive. This is especially true for the indifference relation, which can lead an individual to make a series of choices which in their totality would be viewed by the same individual as erroneous. There is a substantial literature that raises intricate questions about individual liberty and the role of government intervention in such contexts. The aim of this paper is not to go into these ethical matters but to provide a formal structure for such analysis by characterizing games where individual preferences are quasi-transitive. The paper identifies a set of axioms which are sufficient for the existence of Nash equilibria in such games.","[Basu, Kaushik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Pattanaik, Prasanta K.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Basu, K (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kb40@cornell.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We find compelling supporting evidence in the behavior of participants who send and respond to others' statements of confidence about how well they have scored on an IQ test. In two-player tournaments where the higher score wins, a player is very likely to choose to compete when he knows that his own stated confidence is higher than the other player's, but rarely when the reverse is true. Consistent with this behavior, stated confidence is inflated by males when deterrence is strategically optimal and is instead deflated (by males and females) when luring (encouraging entry) is strategically optimal. This behavior is consistent with the equilibrium of the corresponding signaling game. Overconfident statements are used in environments that seem familiar, and we present evidence that suggests that this can occur on an unconscious level.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [van de Ven, Jeroen] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van de Ven, Jeroen] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; arust@econ.umn.edu; j.vandeven@uva.nl,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024","van de Ven, Jeroen/0000-0001-5111-0427",,,,,41,41,44,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

India has emerged as a leading rice exporter. The Government of India has introduced the National Food Security Act which requires 33.6 million tons of rice per year for its public food distribution system. In this study, we modeled India's rice market and analyzed policy implications of the long-term impact of India's food security act on domestic and international rice market. We developed a structural economic demand and supply model for India's rice market and further added subsidy equations to trace the consequence of National Food Security Act on domestic rice consumption and on the international market. We specifically focus on three different scenarios: subsidy as price effect, subsidy as inelastic income effect, and subsidy as elastic income effect under the broader framework of National Food Security Act. We found that at the end of the projection period (2024-2025), as a result of rice subsidy program, the consumption of rice increases significantly in the case of price effect while the inelastic income effect has no or less impact on production, consumption, and export of rice. Hence, the policy implication of our study is that if the objective of the National Food Security Act is to increase consumption then it needs to be implemented as price effect.

Further, policies that raise the supply of prospective charter entrants in combination with high authorization standards enhance social welfare.","[Ferreyra, Maria Marta] World Bank, 1818 H St NW 18-808, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kosenok, Grigory] New Econ Sch, Nakhimovsky Pr 47,Room 1109, Moscow 117418, Russia",The World Bank; New Economic School,"Ferreyra, MM (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW 18-808, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mferreyra@worldbank.org; gkosenok@nes.ru,,,World Bank; Berkman Faculty Development Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"World Bank(The World Bank India); Berkman Faculty Development Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","We thank David Albouy, Joe Altonji, Stanislav Anatolyev, Steve Berry, Juan Esteban Carranza, Marcus Casey, Rajashri Chakrabarti, Estelle Dauchy, Pablo D'Erasmo, Dennis Epple, Fernando Ferreira, Steve Glazerman, Phil Gleason, Brett Gordon, Bryan Graham, Marc Gurgand, Phil Haile, Michael Hansen, Justine Hastings, Dan McMillen, Aviv Nevo, Javier Penia, B.
