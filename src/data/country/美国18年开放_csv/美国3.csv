The statistician uses techniques such as least squares to estimate peer-implied fair values from the market values of replicating portfolios with the same accounting statements as the company being valued. Divergence of a company's peer-implied value estimate from its market value represents mispricing, motivating a convergence trade that earns risk-adjusted returns of up to 10% per year and is economically significant for both large and small cap firms. The rate of convergence decays to zero over the subsequent 34 months. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that implied prepayments are generally higher than actual prepayments, providing direct evidence of significant macroeconomic-driven prepayment risk premiums in mortgage-backed security prices.

The gender log wage gap at the mean is 55% in 1999-2000 and 49% in 2009-10, but this change is not statistically significant. The Blinder-Oaxaca and the Machado-Mata-Melly decompositions indicate that, in both years, the bulk of the gender wage gap is unexplained, i.e., possibly discriminatory. They also reveal that over the decade, while the wage-earning characteristics of women improved relative to men, the discriminatory component of the gender wage gap also increased. In fact, in 2009-10, if women were paid like men, they would have earned more than men on account of their characteristics. In both years, we see the existence of the sticky floor, in that gender wage gaps are higher among low-wage earners and lower for high wage earners. Over the ten-year period, we find that the sticky floor became stickier for RWS women. Machado-Mata-Melly decompositions reveal that, in both years, women at the lower end of the wage distribution face higher discriminatory gaps compared to women at the upper end.

We find that both urban and rural households report seasonal hunger in the pre-harvest months. Certain strategies to smooth consumption, including crop storage and livestock ownership, are associated with fewer months of hunger. In addition, we find that Malawian households that experience seasonal hunger harvest their crops earlier than average - a short-term coping mechanism that can reduce the crop's yield and nutritional value, possibly perpetuating hunger.","[Anderson, C.

Since then, the growth of intermediated asset management and consolidation in the asset management sector has led to more pronounced common-ownership links at the level at which corporate control is exercised. Recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature's prediction that common-ownership concentration (CoOCo) can affect product market outcomes. The resulting antitrust concerns have received worldwide attention. However, because CoOCo can change the objective function of a firm, the potential implications span all fields of economics that involve corporate conduct, including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.","[Schmalz, Martin C.] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schmalz, Martin C.] Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Schmalz, Martin C.] Ifo Inst Ctr Econ Studies CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Schmalz, Martin C.] European Corp Governance Inst ECGI, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Corporate Governance Institute,"Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR, London EC1V 0DX, England.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Ctr Econ Studies CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，European Corp Governance Inst ECGI, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",schmalz@umich.edu,,,,,,,165,92,109,28,101,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner-occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply.","[Nathanson, Charles G.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zwick, Eric] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zwick, Eric] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nathanson, CG (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,", Charles G.

With limited liability, the agent's wage is increasing in output only if output exceeds a threshold, else it is zero regardless of output. If the threshold is sufficiently high, the agent only beats it, and is rewarded for increasing output through greater effort, if there is a high noise realization.

These non-traditional loans, including interest-only and negative-amortization mortgages, enable households to postpone loan repayment in contrast to fully amortizing traditional mortgages. Contrary to common perception, complex mortgages are used by households with high-income levels and prime credit scores, quite unlike the low-income population targeted by subprime mortgages. Nonetheless, we find that complex-mortgage borrowers become delinquent on their mortgages at rates twice as high as borrowers with plain-vanilla fixed-rate contracts even after controlling for household and loan characteristics.

Unique characteristics of this setting combined with high-frequency data disentangle effects of multiple pollutants and identify previously underexplored acute effects. We find that a 1 ppm increase in 3-hour CO causes an 11.5% increase in the propensity of umpires to make incorrect calls and a 10 g/m(3) increase in 12-hour PM2.5 causes a 2.6% increase. We control carefully for a variety of potential confounders, and results are supported by robustness and falsification checks.

Slow economic and trade growth during the recovery from the Great Recession, as well as recent political developments in the UK and USA, pose a threat to cross-border supply chains and have thus brought this question to the forefront of policy circles. This note investigates by examining new and detailed data on Group of 20 (G20) trade policy use through 2016, with a special emphasis on changes in policymaking behavior since 2010. First, there is no evidence that the G20 economies made significant changes to their applied import tariffs during this period. However, there has been a modest increase in import protection arising through other policy instruments of note such as the temporary trade barriers (TTBs) of antidumping, countervailing duties and safeguards. More importantly, there is evidence of changes in how countries have applied their TTBs. TTBs were increasingly imposed on imports not only from China, but also on imports from other countries, reversing a post-2001 trend. Furthermore, TTB protection has moved away from imports of final goods and toward imports of intermediate inputs. These shifts in policy have several potential contributing causes as well as economic consequences, including for cross-border supply chains.","[Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，CEPR, Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cbown@piie.com,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,30,9,9,0,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In this paper, we expand our understanding of this form of pro-social behavior to help explain a puzzle of voting: why do individuals who are indifferent between two potential policy outcomes of an election participate when voting is costly? Using a simple voting experiment, we provide robust evidence that many voters are willing to engage in voting as a form of punishment, even when voting is costly and the voter has no monetary stake in the election outcome. In our sample, and in a robustness check through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that at least fourteen percent of individuals are willing to incur a cost to vote against candidates who broke their electoral promises, even when they have no pecuniary interest in the election outcome.","[Aimone, Jason A.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Butera, Luigi] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Baylor University; University of Chicago; George Mason University,"Aimone, JA (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",Jason_Aimone@baylor.edu; lbutera2@gmail.com; tstratma@gmu.edu,,,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Financial support from The Mercatus Center at George Mason University is gratefully acknowledged.,,54,4,4,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Prior work on biological pollution problems generally examines the efficient allocation of prevention and control efforts, but does not identify the specific externalities underpinning the design of efficiency-enhancing policy instruments. Prior analyses also focus on problems where those being damaged do not contribute to externalities. We examine a problem where the initial biological introduction harms the importer and then others are harmed by spread from this importer. Here, the externality is the spread of infection beyond the initial importer. This externality is influenced by the importer's private risk management choices, which provide impure public goods that reduce disease spillovers to others-making disease spread a filterable externality. We derive efficient policy incentives to internalize filterable disease externalities given uncertainties about introduction and spread. We find efficiency requires incentivizing an importer's trade choices along with self-protection and abatement efforts, in contrast to prior work that targets trade alone. Perhaps surprisingly, we find these incentives increase with importers' private risk management incentives and with their ability to directly protect others. In cases where importers can spread infection to each other, we find filterable externalities may lead to multiple Nash equilibria.","[Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Western Michigan University; Western Michigan University; Michigan State University,"Reeling, C (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.;Reeling, C (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",carson.reeling@wmich.edu,,"Reeling, Carson/0000-0002-6203-0649","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [2011-67023-30872, 1R01GM100471-01]; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1414374] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant #2011-67023-30872, Grant #1R01GM100471-01 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health, and NSF Grant #1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.

Evidence from rural Mali,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; Inequality; Empowerment; Public opinion; Political knowledge; Family Code,GENDER-GAP; PARTICIPATION; IMPACT; HOUSEHOLD; DEMOCRATIZATION; REPRESENTATION; ENGAGEMENT; NETWORKS; AFRICA; LABOR,"According to many prominent theorists of democracy, citizens must be able to formulate and signify preferences to participate as 'political equals' for democracy to work (Dahl, 1971). However, a gender gap in political knowledge and opinions exists across the Global South, especially in rural areas. In this paper, we study the relationship between rural women's socioeconomic empowerment (household agency and mobility outside the village) and political knowledge and opinions in Mali, a West African country with patriarchal gender norms. To reduce well-known difficulties of gaining access to rural women and reducing bystander effects, we use simultaneous co-gender interviews of one man and one woman per extended family household and a modified Audio-Self-Administered Questionnaire for illiterate populations. Further to reduce satisficed opinions, we elicit opinion justifications and measure justified opinions. Consistent with predictions, we find that women's empowerment is positively associated with rural women's political knowledge and opinions. We close by examining opinions towards one controversial policy area with redistributive consequences for men and women-the Family Code, which regulates rights of men and women in marriage, inheritance, and the family. More empowered women are more likely to support pro-woman changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We address this question in the context of international trade, using disaggregated product-level data from seventy-one countries exporting to the USA. We show that exported products exit the US market sooner if they stand far away from the exporting country's comparative advantage. This pattern is stronger when the exporting country has a well-developed banking system, but it is unaffected by the depth of stock markets. These results are in accordance with theories stressing the disciplining role of debt and monitoring abilities of banks.","[Jaud, Melise] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Jaud, Melise] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kukenova, Madina] Business Sch Lausanne, Chavannes Pres Renens, Switzerland; [Strieborny, Martin] Lund Univ, Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Lausanne; The World Bank; Lund University,"Jaud, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Jaud, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,"Strieborny, Martin/0000-0002-6566-6634",Swiss National Science Foundation; Handelsbanken Research Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Handelsbanken Research Foundation,"We would like to thank Thorsten Beck (editor) and an anonymous referee, as well as Jean Imbs, Tibor Besedes (discussant), Chad Bown, Marius Brulhart, Olivier Cadot, Alan Deardorff, Shantayanan Devarajan, Jens Forssbaeck, Reto Follmi, Caroline Freund, Amit Goyal, Andrei Levchenko, Frederik Lundtofte, Alberto Paloni, Ryan Peters (discussant), Jun Qian (session chair), Akiko Suwa-Eisenmann, Mathias Thoenig, Anders Vilhelmsson, Tianxiao Zheng (discussant), a World Bank referee, as well as conference and seminar participants at the China International Conference in Finance 2016, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Gothenburg-Lund Workshop in Finance, Lund University, IFN Stockholm, EIIT Conference, Midwest Meeting in International Trade, 6th FIW Research Conference International Economics, and 8th Australasian Trade Workshop for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Specifically, we examine the relationship between the loan description written by a borrower and whether or not the project is funded by investors. Using textual analysis, we find that small business loan descriptions can be used to predict the likelihood that the loan will be funded. We also find that an index, created from a textual analysis of the words used in the loan description, can forecast the performance of the loan, specifically whether or not the loan defaults. This index has the strongest impact when we focus on borrowers with low FICO scores, suggesting that for these individuals the description can signal information that standard measures used for lending purposes cannot. Overall, it appears as though investors are making investment decisions based on proper and relevant signals given by the borrowers through the loan description.

Using a multidimensional measure, we find that greater board diversity leads to lower volatility and better performance. The lower risk levels are largely due to diverse boards adopting more persistent and less risky financial policies. However, consistent with diversity fostering more efficient (real) risk-taking, firms with greater board diversity also invest persistently more in research and development (R&D) and have more efficient innovation processes. Instrumental variable tests that exploit exogenous variation in firm access to the supply of diverse nonlocal directors indicate that these relations are causal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We ask how the Medicaid rules map into the reality of Medicaid recipiency, and we ask what other observable characteristics are important to determine who ends up on Medicaid. The data show that both singles and couples with high retirement income can end up on Medicaid at very advanced ages. We find that, conditioning on a large number of observable characteristics, including those that directly relate to Medicaid eligibility criteria, single women are more likely to end up on Medicaid - so are non-white people, but, surprisingly, their higher recipiency is concentrated in the higher income percentiles. We also find that people with low incomes who have a high-school diploma or higher degree are much less likely to end up receiving Medicaid than their less-educated counterparts.

The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. Hence, issuers will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. Issuers may either under-or over-provide information compared to the socially efficient level if speculators have more bargaining power than hedgers, while they never under-provide it otherwise.

In addition, the Contingent Behavior Method is used to estimate the changes in welfare associated with the construction of an alpine center that would provide services aiming to reduce the risk of injury and death associated with winter outdoor recreation. The data is analyzed by means of latent class panel on-site count models. The latent class approach allows us to identify subpopulations that benefit from the alpine center.

This paper explores whether and how thin-capitalization rules, which restrict interest deductibility beyond a certain amount, affect corporate debt ratios and mitigate corporate default risk. We find that rules targeted at related party borrowing (the majority of today's rules) have no significant impact on debt bias, as they do not affect third-party borrowing. These rules also have no effect on broader indicators of firm corporate distress. Rules applying to all debt, in contrast, turn out to be effective: the presence of such a rule reduces the debt-asset ratio in an average company by 5 percentage points; and they reduce the probability of a firm being in financial distress by 5 percent. Debt ratios are found to be more responsive to thin capitalization rules in industries characterized by a high share of tangible assets. (C) 2018 International Monetary Fund.

The intent is to explore how foreign remittances have evolved and impacted poverty and economic well-being of households. Focusing on a consistent set of households across the three survey rounds in a balanced panel format helps examine the effect of foreign remittances with appropriate controls. Results from methodologically consistent, random-effects regressions that correct for potential attrition and heterogeneity bias support significant poverty-reducing and, more accurately, economic well-being-enhancing effects of foreign remittances especially when originating in countries other than India. This and other findings are valuable to the assessment of policies on utilizing foreign labor migration and remittances as a vehicle to reduce poverty in Nepal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In single-office elections, a classic spoiler turns a winner into a non-winner and a non-winner into a winner. Such spoilers rarely appear in multi-office elections. In such elections, spoilers include a Kingmaker, who turns a non-winner into a winner; a Kingslayer, who turns a winner into a non-winner; a Valuegobbler, who subtracts from some competitor more seats than it receives; and Selfspoilers, who may be hurt by competing separately rather than creating an electoral coalition. Various strategic spoilers, such as fake parties, are possible as well. I look for spoilers in eight Polish parliamentary elections that have taken place since the fall of communism in 1989. In two elections, the consequences of spoilers were massive. In 1993, multiple spoilers on the right helped the two post-communist parties return to power, slow down decommunization and create strong institutional obstacles to further democratization. In 2015, a spoiler manufactured a majority for the largest party (PiS) and, as a consequence, enabled PiS quickly to implement radical reforms. In other elections, spoilers had smaller, but noticeable consequences. The results suggest that parliamentary elections using PR party-list systems are vulnerable to spoiler problems that may cause significant political effects.","[Kaminski, Marek M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Math Behav Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kaminski, Marek M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Kaminski, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Math Behav Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Kaminski, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",marek.kaminski@uci.edu,"Kaminski, Marek/HLV-9448-2023","Kaminski, Marek/0000-0003-3997-0541",UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy,UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy,"The support of the UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy is acknowledged.

Yet, another important promise of the treaties has been ignored altogether. Architects of the investment treaty regime, as well as many current proponents, have suggested that the treaties allow developing countries to de-politicize investor-state disputes; i.e. shield commercial disputes from broader political and diplomatic considerations with developed states. While this argument is widely accepted by legal scholars and practitioners and explicitly promoted by capital-exporting states, it has never been subjected to empirical investigation. We provide the first such test, using an original dataset of US diplomatic actions in 219 individual investment disputes across 73 countries as well as detailed case studies drawing on internal US State Department diplomatic cables. We find no evidence for the de-politicization hypothesis: diplomatic engagement remains important for investor-state dispute settlement, and the US government is just as likely to intervene in developing countries that have ratified investment treaties with the US as those that have not. Coercive American intervention in investment disputes is rare, but this is a general feature of American investment diplomacy after the Cold War, rather than one limited to investors with recourse to legalized dispute settlement procedures. These findings provide a critical corrective to our understanding of the investment treaty regime, and have important implications for understanding the effects of international legalization on developing countries.

This requires new asymptotic theory which leads to several tests for the significance of function-valued regression coefficients.

Returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis.

Each of these two questions is an example of a broad category of questions of great relevance for the economics of risk. The second question is an example of a contingent risk comparison, while the question behind second-order stochastic dominance is an example of a non-contingent risk comparison. The stochastic order arising from a contingent risk comparison is obviously weaker than that arising from the corresponding non-contingent risk comparison, but we show that the two stochastic orders are closely related, so that the answer to a non-contingent risk comparison problem always provides the answer to the corresponding contingent risk comparison problem. In addition to showing the connection between parallel contingent and non-contingent risk comparison problems, we articulate a method for solving both kinds of problems using the basis'' approach. The basis approach has often been used implicitly, but we argue that there is value in making its use explicit, particularly in indicating which new, previously unsolved problems can readily be solved by the basis approach and which cannot.","[Gollier, Christian] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Kimball, Miles S.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Gollier, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",christian.gollier@tse-fr.eu,,,European Research Council under the European Community [230589],European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),"Helpful comments from Susan Athey, Rose-Anne Dana, Ian Jewitt, Jean-Charles Rochet, Edward Schlee, and two anonymous referees are acknowledged.

We found that a Pigouvian tax (optimum ad valorem tax) that corrects the externalities depends on economic and biological parameters in both fisheries. Correcting for the externalities results in a reduction in aquaculture production but not optimum wild catch. Furthermore, with foreign capital in aquaculture, the Pigouvian tax equals the ratio of net to total benefit from aquaculture. Numerical values are used to illustrate the results.","[Akpalu, Wisdom] Univ Ghana, UNU WIDER, Legon, Ghana; [Bitew, Worku T.] SUNY, Dept Math, Farmingdale, NY USA",University of Ghana; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Maritime College,"Akpalu, W (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, UNU WIDER, Legon, Ghana.",akpalu@wider.unu.edu,,,,,,,24,1,1,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

(2015) q-factor model outperforms other factor models in capturing the price-to-high (PTH, the ratio of current price to 52-week high price) anomaly; that is, high-PTH stocks earn high future returns. PTH's relations with future profitability and future investment growth are both significantly positive, and they mirror PTH's relation with future returns in the cross section and by time horizons. Incorporating the information about future investment growth contained in price level variables (e.g., PTH) helps the q factors to capture better those anomalies rooted in future investment growth. Together, these results suggest that the PTH anomaly is consistent with the investment capital asset pricing model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model simplifies urban space by dividing it into two zones (islands), center and suburbs, which are connected by a congested road and a public-transit line. Each road commuter requires an allotment of CBD land for parking, and because the central zone's area is fixed, parking land reduces the amount available for central residences and CBD production. The model characterizes optimal resource allocation from the perspective of a social planner. The planning solution can be decentralized, which requires employee- rather than employer-paid parking, congestion tolls, and a tax (subsidy) to offset the road capacity deficit (surplus). The analysis then considers the effect of switching to employer-paid parking, with the burden of parking costs shifting from road users to employers, thus reducing the wage for all workers. This switch inefficiently increases road usage and capacity investment, while spurring an inefficient increase in suburbanization.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Franco, Sofia F.] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu; sfranco@novasbe.pt,,,,,,,30,27,29,1,20,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

When managers vary in ability, determining who is good and who is not is vital. Moreover, knowing they will be assessed can lead those being assessed to behave in ways that make them appear better. Such signal-jamming behavior can be beneficial (e.g., an executive Works harder on behalf of shareholders) or harmful (e.g., the behavior is myopic, boosting short-term performance at the expense of long-term success). In standard models of assessment, it is assumed those doing the assessing behave according to Bayes Theorem. But what if the assessors suffer from one of many well-documented cognitive biases that makes them less-than-perfect Bayesians? This paper begins an exploration of that issue by considering the consequence of one such bias, the base-rate fallacy, for two of the canonical assessment models: career-concerns and optimal monitoring and replacement. Although firms can suffer due to the base-rate fallacy, they can also benefit from this bias.","[Hermalin, Benjamin E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hermalin, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hermalin@econ.berkeley.edu,,,Thomas & Alison Schneider Distinguished Professorship in Finance,Thomas & Alison Schneider Distinguished Professorship in Finance,The author thanks Heather Montgomery for her helpful discussion of this paper at the nber-tcer-cepr (trio) Conference and the other participants at that conference for their comments.

Our analysis distinguishes between short and long-run effects and accounts for the consequences of naturalization and assimilation. We use the model to analyze Spain's large 2000-2008 immigration wave. We find that immigration led to a 15% increase in public enrollment in the short run, together with a 3% reduction in public education spending and almost a 1 percentage-point increase in the share of native households using private schools. Depending on the eventual degree of assimilation, these trends will be greatly intensified or mitigated once immigrants naturalize and gain the right to vote. Our analysis suggests that assimilation in terms of family size and the value assigned to children's education are the most relevant dimensions quantitatively. We also show that immigration policies that favor one group over another can significantly alter the overall effects of immigration on the schooling system.","[Tanaka, Ryuichi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Farre, Lidia] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Ortega, Francesc] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Farre, Lidia] IAE CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",University of Tokyo; University of Barcelona; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Tanaka, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",ryuichi.tanaka@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp; lidia.farre@ub.edu; fortega@qc.cuny.edu,"Farre, Lidia/AAA-1991-2019",", Ryuichi/0000-0002-3483-5175; ortega, francesc/0000-0001-5779-5711","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24330077]; Government of Catalonia [SGR2014-325]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76866-R]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02535, 17K03757, 25245040] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We benefitted from insightful comments by Antonio Cabrales, Daniele Coen-Pirani, Matthias Doepke, Shin-ichi Fukuda, Kyle Hyndman, Max Steinhardt, Weina Zhou and seminar participants at CUNY, Dalhousie University, University of Tokyo, University of Tsukuba, Development Bank of Japan, and Tokyo Labor Economics Workshop.

Binary logit models and marginal effects were estimated using 22 plant traits and consumers' purchasing interest, existing knowledge, and demographic variables. Results imply consumers interested in purchasing pollinator friendly plants selected positive traits regardless of accuracy. Furthermore, consumers selected traits that aligned with their knowledge.

Perspectives of Bangladeshi Women,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PHYSICAL VIOLENCE; GENDER; RISK; RESOURCES; MARRIAGE; AUTONOMY,"Studies addressing the relationship between women's empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) have yielded conflicting findings. Some suggest that women's economic and social empowerment is associated with an increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), arguably because men use often IPV to enforce their dominance and reassert inegalitarian gender norms when patriarchal norms are challenged; other studies suggest the converse. It is important to understand why these findings are contradictory to create a more sound basis for designing both women's empowerment interventions and anti-violence interventions. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between women's empowerment and IPV in a setting where gender roles are rapidly changing and IPV rates are high. We examine some of the ways in which the nature of women's empowerment evolved in six villages in rural Bangladesh during a 12-year period in which surveys have documented a decline of 11 points in the percentage of married women experiencing IPV in the prior year. The paper is.based on data from 74 life history narratives elicited from 2011 to 2013 with recently married Bangladeshi women from the six villages, whom other community residents identified as empowered. Our findings suggest that women's empowerment has evolved in several ways that may be contributing to reductions in IPV: in its magnitude (for example, many women are earning more income than they previously did), in women's perceived exit options from abusive marriages, in the propensity of community members to intervene when IPV occurs, and in the normative status of empowerment (it is less likely to be seen as transgressive of gender norms). The finding that community-level perceptions of empowered women can evolve over time may go a long way in explaining the discrepant results in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the endogeneity of the geographical distribution of the Hoa, we use an important historical episode: the rapid deterioration in Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relationship that led many ethnic Chinese to flee abroad, particularly to the refugee camps in the Guangxi province of China, in 1979. We find that the effects of proximity to the refugee camps on the share of ethnic Chinese in 1989 were more pronounced for provinces that had a larger presence of the ethnic Chinese population in 1979. We also find strong correlations between the 1989 share of ethnic Chinese (instrumented) and contemporary indicators of economic performance. The results suggest that the ethnic Chinese minority had positive economic impacts on Vietnam's regional economies and that the post-Vietnam War exodus of ethnic Chinese was likely to have had long-term negative economic impacts.","[Tuan Anh Nguyen-Viet] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Imai, Masami] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Southern California; Wesleyan University,"Imai, M (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",mimai@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,32,5,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The nature of this uncertainty is different from that of a typical uncertainty shock because of its length, breadth and political complexity. Consequently, a new firm-level survey, the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), was created to investigate this, finding three key results. First, Brexit was reported to be one of the top three sources of uncertainty for around 40 per cent of UK businesses in the two years after the vote in the June 2016 referendum, and this proportion increased further in Autumn 2018. Hence, Brexit provided both a major and persistent uncertainty shock. Second, uncertainty has been higher in industries that are more dependent on trade with the EU and on EU migrant labour. Third, the uncertainties around Brexit are primarily about the impact on businesses over the longer term rather than shorter term, including uncertainty about the timing of any transition arrangements and around the nature of Brexit.","[Bloom, Nicholas; Chen, Scarlet] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bunn, Philip; Smietanka, Pawel] Bank England, London, England; [Mizen, Paul] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Thwaites, Greg] LSE Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Young, Garry] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, Westminster, England",Stanford University; Bank of England; University of Nottingham,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; philip.bunn@bankofengland.co.uk; sijiac@stanford.edu; paul.mizen@nottingham.ac.uk; pawel.smietanka@bankofengland.co.uk; g.d.thwaites@lse.ac.uk; g.young@niesr.ac.uk,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P010385/1]; ESRC [ES/P010385/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P010385/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent those of the Bank of England or its Committees.

Increasing trend inflation from 2 to 4 percent generates a consumption-equivalent welfare loss of about 4 percent. Welfare costs of this magnitude are driven by: staggered wage contracts, trend growth, extended borrowing, a roundabout production structure, and the interaction between trend inflation and shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment (MEI). A sticky-price model abstracting from these features generates much smaller losses. Moderate trend inflation also has important business-cycle implications, interacting much more strongly with MEI shocks than with productivity or monetary shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretically, Uber's effect on transit is ambiguous: while Uber is an alternative mode of travel, it can also increase the reach and flexibility of public transit's fixed-route, fixed-schedule service. We estimate the effect of Uber on public transit ridership using a difference-in-differences design that exploits variation across U.S. metropolitan areas in both the intensity of Uber penetration and the timing of Uber entry. We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years. This average effect masks considerable heterogeneity, with Uber increasing ridership more in larger cities and for smaller transit agencies.","[Hall, Jonathan D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Hall, Jonathan D.] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Palsson, Craig] Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, 3500 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Price, Joseph] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 162 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Price, Joseph] Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Brigham Young University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hall, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.;Hall, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",jonathan.hall@utoronto.ca; craig.palsson@usu.edu; josephprice@byu.edu,,"Hall, Jonathan/0000-0003-3835-9097",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful for helpful feedback from Jonathan V.

We find that optimal bank liquidity is lower than would be the case under rational expectations, and, consequently, the banking system is more vulnerable to adverse shocks, which lead to bank runs. Asset pledgeability of surviving banks is also affected so that their capacity to raise external funds for purchasing assets of distressed banks is weakened. Further, we examine the case when asset returns are correlated through securitization. In this case adverse shocks are felt uniformly across the banking sector and banks that survive with the help of a public liquidity backstop will become risk-averse and reluctant to purchase distressed assets. Finally, we explore a government funded asset purchase program, that is implemented with an asset price target.","[Bernardin, Thomas] St Olaf Coll, Dept Econ, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Park, Hyun Woong] Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",Saint Olaf College; University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Park, HW (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",parkhw@denison.edu; bernar1@stolaf.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Using data from three large German states, we find that legislators elected in the electoral system's majoritarian tier more often become members of district committees, i.e., committees that might give politicians greater opportunity than others to obtain government funds for the benefit of their home districts. This effect is strongest for legislators who won district elections by narrow margins. Moreover, we find that districts that are better represented on district committees receive more government funds.","[Maaser, Nicola] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangsallee 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 1D3 Carow Hall, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Aarhus University; George Mason University,"Stratmann, T (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 1D3 Carow Hall, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",tstratma@gmu.edu,"Maaser, Nicola Friederike/IXN-3011-2023","Maaser, Nicola/0000-0003-3054-567X",German Research Foundation [MA-5085]; Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg,"We are grateful to Zareh Asatryan and to two anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments.

In current practice, progress is frequently measured using the multidimensional poverty index. While elegant and useful, the multidimensional poverty index is inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights principles of indivisibility, inalienability, and equality. We argue that a first-order dominance (FOD) methodology maintains basic consistency with these principles. Specifically, FOD comparisons are independent of any applied weighting schemes and hence are free from assumptions regarding substitutability between included welfare indicators (indivisibility). FOD cannot be established when welfare in any indicator is deteriorating, no matter how great the advancement is in other indicators (inalienability). Finally, FOD requires that domination occurs throughout the population (equality), implying that welfare gains among better-off groups never offset welfare losses among worse-off groups. We discuss and compare the properties of the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approach and apply both measures to 26 African countries using data near 2002 and 2012. Results across the two measures are broadly similar but not the same. For example, while the multidimensional poverty index suggests that all countries are advancing, FOD indicates that 14 countries experience broad-based progress, two countries show more moderate likelihoods of progress, and the remaining 10 countries neither improve nor deteriorate in terms of attainment of rights for the dimensions considered. We conclude that the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approaches are useful complements that should be employed in tandem. (C) 2018 UNU-WIDER.

We examine how ex ante management is an opportunity to influence the ex post conditions, which in turn affect the ex post optimal outcome. To capture these ex ante management choices, we extend the Poisson collapse model of Reed and Heras (Bull Math Biol 54:185-207, 1992) to allow for endogenous initial conditions and ex post multi-stability. We account for two uncertain processes: the introduction and establishment of the pathogen. Introduction is conditional on anthropogenic investments in prevention, and both random processes are conditional on how we manage the native population to provide natural prevention of invasion and natural insurance against establishment placing the system in an undesirable basin of attraction. We find that both multi-stability of the invaded system and these uncertainty processes can create economic non-convexities that yield multiple candidate solutions to the ex ante optimization problem. Additionally, we illustrate how the nature of natural protection against introduction and establishment risks can play an important role in the allocation of anthropogenic investments.","[Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Finnoff, David; Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Berry, Kevin] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, Anchorage, AK USA; [Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Michigan State University; University of Wyoming; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Western Michigan University,"Finnoff, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",horan@msu.edu; finnoff@uwyo.edu; kberry13@alaska.edu; carson.reeling@wmich.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Reeling, Carson/0000-0002-6203-0649; Berry, Kevin/0000-0002-6904-4349; Finnoff, David/0000-0003-0775-9733",NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M008894/1]; NOAA CSCOR Grant [NA09NOS4780192]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [1R01GM100471-01]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67023-30872]; BBSRC [BB/M008894/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NOAA CSCOR Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from NSF Grant #1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program, and by UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant BB/M008894/1.

In particular, we show that if the central bank does not intervene by monetary easing following a crisis, an aggregate demand externality makes borrowing ex ante inefficient. If instead the central bank follows the optimal discretionary policy and intervenes to stabilize asset prices and real activity, we show examples in which the aggregate demand externality disappears, reducing the need for ex ante intervention.","[Bornstein, Gideon] Northwestern Univ, Econ, Evanston, IL USA; [Lorenzoni, Guido] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Lorenzoni, G (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",guido.lorenzoni@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,12,6,6,0,3,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The model incorporates long-term impacts of consumption shortfalls, induced by optimal 'asset smoothing' coping behavior of the vulnerable, on poverty. The analysis shows the long-term level and depth of poverty can be improved by incorporating 'vulnerability-targeted social protection' into a conventional social protection system. The paper further shows insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection dominates (in economic growth and poverty reduction measures) both in-kind transfers and asset-based vulnerability-targeted protection. We then stress test social protection mechanisms and find the relative performance of insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection improves when subjected to current pessimistic projections about increasing drought risk. However, if drought risk increases beyond current climate change projections, then even the vulnerability-targeted policy loses its ability to stabilize the extent and depth of poverty.","[Carter, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Janzen, Sarah A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 17920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Janzen, SA (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 17920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",sarah.janzen@montana.edu,,,World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"The authors wish to thank the World Bank for financial support, and Harold Alderman, Mook Bangalore, Stephane Hallegatte, Rasmus Heltberg, Peter Lanjouw, Matthew McLaughlin, Emmanuel Skoufias, Adrien Vogt-Schilb, Steve Vosti, participants at the World Bank Climate Change and Poverty Conference, the Midwest International Economic Development Conference, and the Georgia State University Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk's Food Security and Sustainable Supply Chains Workshop, and seminar audiences at Michigan State University and the University of Washington for helpful comments.

We apply the theory to understand the evolving market for academic journals in the Internet age and policies currently being debated such as an open-access mandate.","[McCabe, Mark J.] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [McCabe, Mark J.] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"McCabe, MJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;McCabe, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France.",mmccabe@bu.edu; chris.snyder@dartmouth.edu,,,Open Society Institute; Stigler Center for Study of Economy and State at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; Sloan Foundation [G-2012-10-20]; NET Institute,Open Society Institute; Stigler Center for Study of Economy and State at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

We test for spatial differences and analyze the relationship between the price elasticity of housing supply and the income elasticity of prices, as well as bubble size and duration. The long-term elasticity of house prices with respect to aggregate personal income averages 0.81, but varies considerably across metropolitan areas. The long-term income elasticity generally is greater in the more supply inelastic metropolitan areas, and we show that bubble size and duration are inversely related to supply elasticity. Also short-term momentum and reversion dynamics show substantial spatial heterogeneity.","[Oikarinen, Elias] Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, PL 14100, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Oikarinen, Elias; Engblom, Janne] Univ Turku, Sch Econ, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Bourassa, Steven C.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Bourassa, Steven C.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Sch Publ Adm, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva, GFRI, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Aberdeen, Business Sch, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Hoesli, Martin] Kedge Business Sch, Bordeaux, France",Aalto University; University of Turku; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Aberdeen; Kedge Business School,"Oikarinen, E (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, PL 14100, Aalto 00076, Finland.;Oikarinen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Sch Econ, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, SF-20500 Turku, Finland.",elias.oikarinen@utu.fi; sbourassa@fau.edu; martin.hoesli@unige.ch; janne.engblom@utu.fi,"Bourassa, Steven C/GZK-5077-2022","Bourassa, Steven C/0000-0002-6863-7417; Oikarinen, Elias/0000-0003-4988-9130",OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Academy of Finland [268310]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [268310] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This work was supported by the OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation and the Academy of Finland (first author; grant number 268310).,,46,31,33,0,28,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

These expectations might then in turn shape individuals' investment behaviors, potentially affecting their incomes in subsequent years. As part of an emerging literature on endogenous preferences, economists have begun studying the consequences that exposure to natural disasters have on risk attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. We add to this field by studying the impact of being struck by the December 2012 Cyclone Evan on Fijian households' risk attitudes and subjective expectations about the likelihood and severity of natural disasters over the next 20 years. The randomness of the cyclone's path allows us to estimate the causal effects of exposure on both risk attitudes and risk perceptions. Our results show that being struck by an extreme event substantially changes individuals' risk perceptions as well as their beliefs about the frequency and magnitude of future shocks. However, we find sharply distinct results for the two ethnicities in our sample, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; the impact of the natural disaster aligns with previous results in the literature on risk attitudes and risk perceptions for Indo-Fijians, whereas they have little to no impact on those same measures for indigenous Fijians.

We use risk premium computed from corporate credit spreads to measure a firm's exposure to systematic variation in default risk. Unlike previously used measures, the credit risk premium explicitly accounts for the non-diversifiable component of distress risk. In contrast to prior findings in the literature, we find that stocks with higher systematic default risk exposures have higher expected equity returns which are largely explained by the Fama-French risk factors. We confirm the robustness of these results by using an alternative systematic default risk factor for firms that do not have bonds outstanding.","[Anginer, Deniz] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yildizhan, Celim] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",The World Bank; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Anginer, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Yıldızhan, Çelim/HPP-2576-2023; Yıldızhan, Çelim/ABI-3815-2020","Yıldızhan, Çelim/0000-0001-7323-982X; Yıldızhan, Çelim/0000-0001-7323-982X",,,,,57,13,14,5,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the trade-off theory of debt holds: optimal debt equates the marginal interest tax shield and the marginal expected cost of default.

Shocks to unsecured firm credit explain a far larger fraction of output fluctuations than shocks to secured credit. This article surveys a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which constraints on unsecured firm credit preclude an efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation, which is a forward-looking variable. Self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business cycle dynamics. A dynamic complementarity between current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated belief shocks to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity, and output. The author shows that these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for around half of output volatility.","[Azariadis, Costas] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA; [Azariadis, Costas] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Washington University (WUSTL),"Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA.;Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,39,3,5,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore impacts the provision of public goods. The literature on encouraging formalisation has predominantly focused on reducing the direct costs of formalisation and has found negligible impacts of such policies. In this paper, we focus on a stick intervention, which to the best of our knowledge is the first one in a developing country setting that deals with the most direct and dominant form of informality, that is registration with the tax authority with a direct link to the country's potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. We implement an experiment in which randomly selected firms are visited by tax representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh National Tax Authority stating that the firm is not registered and the consequential punishment if the firm fails to register. We find that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly. We also find that only larger revenue firms at baseline respond to the threat and register. Our findings have at least two important policy implications: i) the enforcement angle, which could be an important tool to encourage formalisation; and ii) targeting of government resources for formalisation to high-end informal firms. The effects are generally small in levels and this leaves open the question of why many firms still do not register.","[De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, Washington, DC USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats Markets, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Org & Voting Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Innovat Poverty Act, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Ploenzke, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rahman, Aminur] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Harvard University; The World Bank,"De Giorgi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, GSEM, Blvd du Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",giacomo.degiorgi@gmail.com,,,PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant] [168],PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant],This work was supported by the PEDL Initiative [partial funding under the SEED Grant #168].,,31,13,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Because of Google's wide range of use, the Trends statistics provide significant information about the investor sentiment and intention, which can be used as decisive factors for corporate and risk management fields. However, an anomaly, a significant increase or decrease, in a certain query cannot be detected by the state of the art applications of computation due to the random baseline noise of the Trends dataset. Since through time, the baseline noise power shows a gradual change an adaptive threshold method is required to track and learn the baseline noise for a correct classification. To this end, we introduce an online method to classify meaningful deviations in Google Trends data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can successfully classify various anomalies for plenty of different data.","[Dere, Duygu] Project Grp Int, Ankara, Turkey; [Ergeneci, Mert] Bilkent Univ, Nanotechnol Res Ctr Nanotam, Ankara, Turkey; [Gokcesu, Kaan] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ergeneci, M (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Nanotechnol Res Ctr Nanotam, Ankara, Turkey.",mertergeneci@bilkent.edu.tr,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,79,81,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.79.81,0.0,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000454212200016,0

In this study, we focus on the post-communist European region, where corporations operate under uncertain conditions. Utilizing a sample with almost 100,000 firm level observations over the period from 2001 to 2013, we analyse effects of uncertainty steaming from corruption environment on innovation decisions of the Central European private firms. We find that domestic firms and firms with dispersed ownership innovate less when business and municipal uncertainty conditions increase. When firms are unsure whether they will be blocked by local bureaucrats from capitalizing on their innovation, they scale down their efforts. However, this result disappears for firms with foreign majority ownership.

Terrorism is a growing threat to internationally active firms, but there has been no empirical research to address the distinctive challenges that terrorism poses for the international marketing activities of firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory investigation, following a two-phase research design. In the first phase it was based on qualitative interviews with internationally active firms. In the second phase, an online survey of a large sample of international firms based in the USA was performed. All measures were developed specifically for the study. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how terrorism affects MNEs, especially those operating in emerging markets. It suggests that terrorism accounts for significant costs in the international marketing budget of MNEs, as well as in planning, and the design of supply chains and distribution channels. Findings also reveal that firms with significant resources and international experience appear to cope better with terrorism's effects. Research limitations/implications - Given the early stage of empirical research on terrorism and international marketing, this study was necessarily exploratory. Practical implications - The paper includes implications and suggestions for multinational companies to increase the security of their businesses through the development of corporate preparedness. Social implications - Terrorism represents not only an organizational crisis at the level of a firm, but it affects the whole society. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study the relationship between the growing threat of terrorism and international business.","[Zeneli, Valbona] George C Marshall European Ctr Secur Studies, Coll Int Secur Studies, Gernackerstr, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Czinkota, Michael R.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC USA; [Knight, Gary] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Georgetown University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Zeneli, V (通讯作者)，George C Marshall European Ctr Secur Studies, Coll Int Secur Studies, Gernackerstr, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",valbona.zeneli@marshallcenter.org,,"Knight, Gary/0000-0003-4793-1200",,,,,68,5,6,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Expert elicitation refers to formal procedures for obtaining and combining expert judgments. Expert elicitation is required when existing data and models cannot provide needed information. This makes validating expert judgments a challenge because they are used when other data do not exist and thus measuring their accuracy is difficult. This article examines the classical model of structured expert judgment, which is an elicitation method that includes validation of the experts' assessments against empirical data. In the classical model, experts assess both the unknown target questions and a set of calibration questions, which are items from the experts' field that have observed true values. The classical model scores experts on their performance in assessing the calibration questions and then produces performance-weighted combinations of the experts. From 2006 through March 2015, the classical model has been used in thirty-three unique applications. Less than one-third of the individual experts in these studies were statistically accurate, highlighting the need for validation. Overall, the performance-based combination of experts produced in the classical model is more statistically accurate and more informative than an equal weighting of experts.","[Colson, Abigail R.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland; [Cooke, Roger M.] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St,NW,Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Strathclyde; Resources for the Future,"Colson, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland.",abigail.colson@strath.ac.uk; cooke@rff.org,"cooke, roger/AGS-4583-2022; Colson, Abigail/H-6441-2017","cooke, roger/0000-0003-0643-1971; Colson, Abigail/0000-0002-3241-5855",,,,,50,69,75,1,121,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We use the rural samples of the three waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, and estimate panel regressions of child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) controlling for time-invariant child-level heterogeneity. On the whole, we find no impact of short-term changes in total gross income on HAZ but document small positive correlations for younger children. Sector-differentiated analyses indicate that compared to wage earnings, only share of income from non-farm self-employment correlates positively with HAZ. Within agriculture, shares of income from consumption of own crop production and from low-protein crop production underlie the negative effect of share of income from crop production. While we cannot claim causal relationships, our findings suggest the possibility of stickiness of crop production to own consumption. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We adopt a fixed-effects estimation strategy, thereby taking into account household-level heterogeneity in health status and private insurance coverage. We find that, before Medicare eligibility, households in poor health, who face a higher risk of medical expenses, are less likely to hold stocks than their healthier counterparts. Yet, this gap is mostly eliminated by Medicare. Notably, the offsetting is primarily experienced by households in poor health and without private health insurance over the observation period.

To ensure robust inference, we estimate scope economies for the microfinance industry using a novel approach which, among its other advantages, accommodates inherent heterogeneity across loans-only and loans-and-savings MFIs as well as controls for endogenous self-selection of institutions into the either type. For analysis, we use a large 2004-2014 Mixmarket dataset. Unlike earlier studies, we do not find prevalent scope economies in the microfinance industry. We find that the median degree of scope economies is statistically indistinguishable from zero and that scope economies are significantly positive for less than a half of loans-and-savings MFIs. For a non-trivial 14% of institutions, the empirical evidence suggests the existence of significantly negative diseconomies of scope indicating that the separate production of loans and savings accounts actually has the potential to reduce an MFI's costs. We also find that the failure to account for endogenous selectivity dramatically overestimates the degree of scope economies resulting in the failure to detect scope diseconomies among MFIs. Thus, our findings call for caution when invoking scope economies as a blanket justification for universal expansion of the scope of financial operations by MFIs. Instead, promoting integrated loans-and-savings MFIs may be justifiable as a means to meeting the needs of the poor rather than as a way for the industry to save costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Combining information on vehicle holdings and use, household attributes, used vehicle prices, crash test results, and yearly fatal accidents for each make, model, and vintage automobile, I calculate a separate willingness to pay for reduced mortality for different age groups.

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace 'big data' - Facebook's advertisement audience estimates - that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform's over 2 billion users to measure and 'nowcast' digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining 'online' indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, 'offline' indicators related to a country's overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.

The article starts by summarizing recent work on global financial cycles. These cycles cause time variation in global risk premia, which affects the transmission mechanisms of both conventional and unconventional monetary policies in small, open economies. The article then summarizes new work showing that the central banks' leaning against the effects of the global financial cycle would typically be too costly. The article concludes with some suggestions for the formation of macroprudential policies.","[Bauer, Gregory] Univ Rochester, Simon Business Sch, Rochester, NY 14620 USA; [Pasricha, Gurnain] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Sekkel, Rodrigo] Bank Canada, Financial Markets Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Terajima, Yaz] Bank Canada, Financial Stabil Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Rochester; Bank of Canada; Bank of Canada; Bank of Canada,"Bauer, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Business Sch, Rochester, NY 14620 USA.",,,"Terajima, Yaz/0000-0001-8161-8096; Sekkel, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4050-4161",,,,,106,3,3,1,22,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Motivated by the recent literature that suggests an increase in crash risk since Fall 2008 and the recent troubles in the Euro zone, we use EUFt/USD FX options for January 2, 2008 to March 18, 2015 to study option-implied risk-neutral densities (RND). We find that RND, especially higher moments, has superior explanatory power in predicting and explaining crash risk and its risk premiums. Furthermore, the higher moments of RND co-move closely with macroeconomic variables. Consistently, we find RND moments outperform the implied volatility from the Black-Scholes model.

Less is known about its effects on psychological well-being, especially in developing countries with agriculture-based economies. In this paper, we test whether extreme temperature and precipitation in India have an effect on self-reported depression symptoms, cognitive and sleep difficulties, and ability to cope with and control life. We use time and geographic variation in weather and show that hot weather in the previous year worsens psychological well-being among rural, but not urban, Indian adults. We examine potential mechanisms and show that the effect is largely driven by hot temperatures during the agricultural season and could be partly attributed to a reduction in agricultural production. We further provide suggestive evidence that the effects of weather shocks could be mitigated with poverty reduction programs such as India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Poor mental health has been associated with low productivity and high healthcare expenditures and is a serious concern in India and many developing countries. The adverse impacts of climate change on rural, agriculture-based economies such as India are likely to increase over time. Given that nearly half of the global population lives in rural areas and is vulnerable to climate variability, understanding the effects of climate on psychological well-being and identifying potential resolutions is critical for insuring vulnerable populations and breaking the poverty cycle.

The creative class is broadly composed of existing and candidate entrepreneurs. The general question we analyze concerns the effects of Schumpeterian competition between existing and candidate entrepreneurs on economic growth and innovation policy in this region. We perform four specific tasks. First, when the flow rate of innovation function for the existing entrepreneurs is strictly concave, we delineate the circumstances in which competition between existing and candidate entrepreneurs leads to a unique balanced growth path (BGP) equilibrium. Second, we examine whether it is possible for the BGP equilibrium to involve different levels of R&D expenditures by the existing entrepreneurs. Third, we show how the BGP equilibrium is altered when the flow rate of innovation function for the existing entrepreneurs is constant. Finally, we study the impact that taxes and subsidies on R&D by existing and candidate entrepreneurs have on R&D expenditures and regional economic growth.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Yoo, Seung Jick] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Int Serv, 100 Cheongpa Ro,47 Gill, Seoul, South Korea",Rochester Institute of Technology; Sookmyung Women's University,"Yoo, SJ (通讯作者)，Sookmyung Womens Univ, Grad Sch Int Serv, 100 Cheongpa Ro,47 Gill, Seoul, South Korea.",aabgsh@rit.edu; sjyoo@sookmyung.ac.kr,"García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021","Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519; YOO, SEUNG JICK/0009-0009-3188-1019",Charles Koch Foundation; Gosnell endowment at RIT; Soolanyung Women's University Research [1-1703-2022],Charles Koch Foundation; Gosnell endowment at RIT; Soolanyung Women's University Research,"For their helpful comments on a previous version of this paper, we thank the Editor Hamid Beladi, two anonymous reviewers, and session participants in the RSAI NARSC Annual Conference in Vancouver, Canada, in November 2017, and in the International Conference in Renmin University of China in Beijing, China, in December 2017.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by comparing quantitative results for our aggregate model with those of a related model that includes within-age-cohort heterogeneity through productivity differences. When we assess proposals to switch from the current tax and transfer system in the United States to a mandatory saving-for-retirement system with no payroll taxation, we find that the aggregate predictions for the two models are close.

Host countries often justify the spending required to stage these events by predicting that mega-events will draw large numbers of tourists. This paper analyzes monthly foreign tourist arrivals into Brazil between 2003 and 2015 and finds that the 2014 FIFA World Cup increased foreign tourism by roughly 1 million visitors. This number far exceeded expectations, but we show that roughly a quarter of this increase in foreign tourism was caused by the fortuitous advancement of Argentina's national team, and potential hosts should not count on the event to consistently produce out-sized tourism figures.

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-a-vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.","[Lane, Philip R.] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.; Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Trinity College Dublin; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund,"Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.;Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",governor@centralbank.ie; gmilesiferretti@imf.org,,,Irish Research Council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","We are very grateful to our discussants Linda Tesar, Anne-Laure Delatte, and Jana Riedel, and to Serkan Arslanalp, Thomas Elkjaer, Thornton Matheson, Victoria Perry, Neeltje Van Horen, two anonymous referees, participants to the IMF's 2016 Annual Research Conference, the Jean Monnet Workshop on Financial Globalization and Its Spillovers, and seminars at the Bank of England, the Banque de France, the Bank of Italy, and France Strategie for useful comments.

The optimal contract may insulate managers from the risk of growth-induced dismissal after periods of good performance.

But, rapid growth in recent years has exposed serious challenges. From production inefficiencies to supply chain disruptions, management recognizes the need to rapidly evolve their family business to a professionally managed one. Their relationship-based supply chain worked for a family firm, but will this approach continue to work as they expand rapidly? A disruption in their egg supply exposed the firm to risks they never anticipated. Now, they are rethinking their entire supply chain, including their most important raw material: flour. How can they strategically manage their raw material needs while sustaining double-digit growth? How do they identify and mitigate risks in their chain? King's Hawaiian knows its success is in its supply chain, including their unique delivery model. Getting this right is critical to their mission: to deliver their aloha spirit to every household, every day.","[Bourquard, Brian A.; Gray, Allan W.] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, Lafayette, IN 47901 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Bourquard, BA (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, Lafayette, IN 47901 USA.",bbourqua@purdue.edu,,,Center for Food and Agricultural Business,Center for Food and Agricultural Business,"Professor Allan W.

To better understand consumers' financial behavior, economic surveys such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) ask participants to report expectations about the stock market. However, readability statistics suggest that the HRS' stock market expectations questions use relatively complex wording, which may contribute to their relatively high rates of missing responses. Here, the authors build on survey design research to improve the readability of these questions. In 2 experiments using national online panels, they test whether revising stock market expectation questions to reduce their difficulty affects respondents' (1) survey experience, as measured by percent of missing answers and ratings of question clarity and difficulty, and (2) response validity, as assessed by respondents' confidence in their answer and comparisons between expectations and stock market outcomes. In both studies, the authors' revisions improved survey experience. Unfortunately, revisions also decreased the perceived (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) validity of responses. The authors discuss implications of question revisions for the design of economic surveys.","[Chin, Alycia] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC USA; [de Bruin, Wandi Bruine] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Chin, A (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",alycia.chin@cfpb.gov,"Chin, Alycia/I-9898-2019; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/N-8588-2018","Chin, Alycia/0000-0002-9570-0549; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/0000-0002-1601-789X","National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [P01 AG026571, R01 AG020717, R01 AG020638]",National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [P01 AG026571; R01 AG020717; R01 AG020638].,,40,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of individual coping strategies in mitigating the impact of adverse weather shocks, but no study to date has presented a comprehensive evaluation of alternative coping strategies. We employ household panel data spanning 15 years to estimate the impact of weather shocks on consumption and poverty dynamics in rural Ethiopia, along with the effectiveness of household coping strategies in alleviating the impact of shocks. We find that rainfall increases are positively associated with per adult equivalent consumption, while high temperatures are negatively associated with consumption. In terms of household coping strategies, formal social safety net transfers mitigate the impact of adverse rainfall shocks on consumption and off-farm employment mitigates the impact of high-temperature shocks. Simulations suggest that rainfall shocks and formal social safety net transfers significantly influence household poverty dynamics. By contrast, high-temperature shocks and off-farm employment have less impact on poverty dynamics. The results highlight the need for social protection programs that support existing household coping strategies and that can rapidly respond to weather shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The contributions in this special issue highlight three aspects of Africa's unfolding economic transformation since 2000: remarkable progress for the region as a whole, highly uneven progress across countries, and unresolved questions about the sustainability of the transformations. The drivers of the region's economic transformations are diverse, and include improved governance, strong agricultural growth in some countries, employment expansion in informal rural off-farm activities, strong local and foreign investment, a period of high global commodity prices, and policy reforms undertaken in earlier decades. Agricultural growth, by expanding job opportunities in the non-farm sectors through multiplier effects, is likely to remain an important driver of continued transformation, though it will increasingly need to rely on productivity growth rather than area expansion.","[Jayne, T.

As a result, concerned commentators suggested that the rising international demand for quinoa, which tripled prices, might have substantially harmed Peruvian quinoa consumers. We study the impacts of rising quinoa prices on the welfare of Peruvian households. Our analysis suggests these fears are unwarranted. A descriptive analysis shows that quinoa is a small part (<1%) of the average household's budget share for the roughly 30% of households that consume quinoa. Our econometric analysis generally finds that as quinoa prices rose, welfare increased in regions with higher concentrations of quinoa consumers. Specifically, we use 11 years of a large-scale, nationally representative household survey to construct pseudo-panels at three geographic (district, province, and department) levels to look at the relationship between the international price of quinoa and the value of real household consumption, our proxy for household welfare. We find for the two smaller geographic regions (i.e., districts and provinces) higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with a small and statistically significant increase in household welfare in response to quinoa price increases; in the largest regions (i.e., departments), higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with small declines in welfare of less than 1% of total household consumption. Our findings that the international trade of quinoa has not been harmful to household welfare in Peru thus run counter to some of the myths surrounding quinoa. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior work shows that competition increases the costs of debt and equity, which reduce the economic profit from investment. Capital constraints, however, may prevent firms from exploiting all positive NPV projects. Using unique survey data and several econometric techniques, we address endogeneity problems that affect both capital constraints and rivals' competitive activities. We find that rivals' competitive activities are positively associated with firms' capital constraints and are more strongly correlated with capital constraints than banking sector competition. We also show that quantity-of-capital constraints are negatively related to firm growth, incremental to the cost of capital. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This article presents five policy proposals that would support more innovation of the environmentally beneficial kind and less innovation of the environmentally harmful kind. We argue that the appropriate portfolio of innovation policies for protecting global environmental systems should include pricing natural capital; providing and targeting research and development (R&D) support towards environmentally beneficial innovations, based on the evidence acquired through more rigorous experimental designs; providing early-stage deployment subsidies for environmentally friendly technologies in particular circumstances; supporting collaborative R&D to leverage complementary capabilities in various types of organizations; and reducing barriers to private sector environmental finance.

Evidence from the manufacturing sector,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Firm performance; Rents; Competition; Manufacturing; Global; Developing countries,FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; COMPETITION; GROWTH; MARKET; PRODUCTIVITY; SEEKING; INNOVATION; PRIVATE; STATE; FIRM,"Are rents, or excess profits, good for development? Rents could induce firms to lobby or bribe governments to preserve the status quo; on the other hand, rents may promote growth by giving firms the needed funds to make investments in fixed capital or research and development. To test this question empirically, we use a panel of manufacturing data at the industry-country-year level, and measure rents by the mark-up ratio. We find that the relationship between rents and growth is strongly negative, with the results being primarily driven by the poorer countries (or those with worse institutions) in the sample. This result holds when we instrument for mark-up using the average mark-up in other industries in the country. Even in industries with high external financing needs and countries with less developed financial sectors, precisely the places where excess profits could be used to drive growth, we find that rents are especially harmful. Consistent with the rent-seeking mechanism we highlight, we find that high rents are associated with a slower reduction in tariffs. We also test for the most likely alternative mechanism, that higher rents cause slower growth through the channel of allowing managerial slack. We find that controlling for management has little impact on our estimate of the impact of mark-up on productivity growth. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The calibrated model suggests that a higher risk of skill loss during unemployment results in a lower job separation rate, because workers accept lower wages in exchange for job security.

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000-2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port - factors associated with institutional arrangements - to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements - that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens - are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization). Inclusive institutions not only foster economic growth but improve health and well-being too. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper builds on the longer experience in the United States to offer lessons for Asia. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has introduced several pay-for-performance programs since 2012 to encourage hospitals to improve quality of care and reduce costs. Some state Medicaid programs have also introduced pay-for-performance for nursing homes. Long-term care providers play an important role in hospital pay-for-performance programs because they can affect the readmission rate and also total episode payments. A good pay-for-performance program will focus on improving quality of care that affects health outcomes. In addition, that quality must vary across providers and be measurable. Furthermore, it is important that the measures be reported in a timely way, that both demand and supply respond to the measures, and that the measures be risk adjusted. Empirical data from Medicare beneficiaries in the state of Michigan show that mean episode payments and readmission rates in skilled nursing facilities vary widely and are sensitive to the number of observations. These practical matters create challenges for implementing pay-for-performance in practice. There is an extensive literature review of pay-for-performance in long-term care in the United States and in Asia.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, M3108 SPH 2,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, M3108 SPH 2,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Michigan Value Collaborative; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,,29,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the role of agricultural productivity in structural transformation in the labor market in small towns and the surrounding rural areas. The empirical work is based on a general equilibrium model that formalizes the demand and labor market linkages: the small-town draws labor away from the rural areas to produce goods and services whose demand may depend largely on rural income. The theory clarifies the role played by the income elasticity of demand and the elasticity of wage with respect to productivity increase in agriculture. For productivity growth to lead to a demand effect, the wage elasticity has to be lower than a threshold. When the demand for goods and services produced in small towns comes mainly from the adjacent rural areas, the demand effect can outweigh the negative wage effect and lead to higher employment in the town-goods sector. The empirical analysis finds a significant positive effect of higher rainfall on rice yield and wages. Using rainfall shocks as a source of exogenous variation, we provide instrumental variables estimates of the effects of agricultural productivity on agricultural wages. The increase in wages is larger in the rural sample compared with the small town economy sample, but structural change in employment is more pronounced in the small town economy. In the rural sample, the positive employment effect is observed only in small-scale manufacturing and services. In contrast, a positive productivity shock in small towns sample has large and positive effect on employment in large scale manufacturing and services (construction, transport, education, and health).

It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.

Dry-ups predict, but do not cause, future deterioration in bank performance. Furthermore, during periods of market stress, banks with high future performance tend to increase reliance on wholesale funding.

Critics argue that community has become a buzzword devoid of content or a mechanism of neoliberal governmentality. This article revisits these approaches to community mobilization, using ethnographic data from a context in which community mobilization has met with wide acclaim: HIV prevention programs in India. Focusing on how the concept of community is used in everyday practice reveals its multivalence and flexibility. I show that, for many planners and administrators of HIV prevention programs, community mobilization is a strategy for placing responsibility for HIV prevention onto groups at risk, but, for those groups, it also has two alternative usages: as the basis for making collective demands, and as a code word for membership in a subversive sexual category. These latter two uses undergird the formation of communities that make new demands on the state. While scholars tend to characterize community mobilization programs in terms of their intent, as either mostly empowering or mostly a mechanism of domination, this article shifts the focus to how the concept of community is used, demonstrating its multiple usages within the same program. I show that groups bring to bear on the concept of community not only abstracted NGO concepts, but also a history of using community in India as a political category of membership. Rather than rejecting or celebrating the concept of community, this article uses ethnography to show how community is put to use and given meaning through everyday struggles for control and survival.

Estimates of the value of water clarity are derived from separate hedonic property value analyses of 14 counties bordering the Bay. The meta-analysis allows us to: (1) estimate the average effect of water clarity in the Chesapeake Bay, (2) investigate heterogeneity of effects across counties based on socioeconomic and ecological factors, (3) evaluate different measures of water clarity used in the original hedonic equations, and (4) transfer the values to Bayfront counties in nearby jurisdictions to estimate the property value impacts of the total maximum daily load (TMDL), a policy to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution entering the Bay that is expected to improve water clarity and ecological health. We also investigate the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power of different transfer strategies and find that a simpler unit value transfer can outperform more complex function transfers. We estimate that aggregate near-waterfront property values could increase by roughly $400-$700 million in response to water clarity improvements from the TMDL.","[Klemick, Heather; Griffiths, Charles; Guignet, Dennis] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Walsh, Patrick] Landcare Res, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Klemick, H (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",klemick.heather@epa.gov,,"Walsh, Patrick/0000-0001-9390-6538; Klemick, Heather/0000-0003-2141-2023",,,,,54,19,21,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The goal is to see what can be learned about the drivers of regional political support for and opposition to such measures. Whether at the state, regional or national levels, carbon taxes are one option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; several state and regional programs are already under way and lowering emissions. This analysis uses a U.S. regional version of the DIEM computable general equilibrium model to explore relationships between carbon taxes, emissions, and economic growth. One area of emphasis is how the distribution of impacts may be affected by differences in regional household spending patterns, the types of industries and electricity generation situated in those regions, and the locations of energy production and energy-intensive manufacturing. The modeling also explores how carbon tax revenues can be used to offset impacts on regional factor earnings.","[Ross, Martin T.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Ross, MT (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",martin.ross@duke.edu,,,Energy Foundation,Energy Foundation,"The work reported here has benefitted from input and feedback from participants in the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum and colleagues at the Nicholas Institute, including Brian Murray and Billy Pizer.

Results from model runs show that the anticipated port infrastructure investments should ensure nationwide fertilizer logistics savings of US$ 845 million over the 2017 through 2025 period. Although these estimated benefits are outstanding, the study indicates that further expansion of Brazil's port system, particularly in the Northern-Arc, presents additional opportunities.

Prior research emphasizes the role of mistakes, irrationalities, or asymmetric information because rational litigants with complete or symmetric information should choose pre-trial settlements over the costs and risks of trial. Using a dynamic incomplete-contracting framework, we provide an overlooked rationale for going to court. Even though risky and costly, going to court can be both rational and socially efficient when a court decision enhances property rights and deters future costly litigation. Experimental evidence supports these predictions.

In India, marriage traditions dictate that two ceremonies take place: the wedding and the gauna ceremony. These differ in timing and purpose. After the wedding, the bride and groom do not necessarily live together. The gauna ceremony indicates the start of marital life and the consummation of the marriage. Results indicate that women in local government decrease the likelihood of child marriage, and delay the age at first marriage and the gauna ceremony. Delaying marriage has important policy implications for both the bride and her future children as it improves education, autonomy over fertility, and health. The results indicate that after 18 years of implementation, exposure to women in government can reduce the prevalence of child marriage.","[Castilla, Carolina] Colgate Univ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Castilla, C (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",ccastilla@colgate.edu,,"Castilla, Carolina/0000-0002-8908-1091",United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),,28,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

For the 632 largest cities in the world we construct panel data describing population, measures of centralization calculated from lights at night data, and the extent of each of the 138 subway systems in these cities. These data indicate that large cities are more likely to have subways but that subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization. For a subset of subway cities we observe panel data describing subway and bus ridership. For those cities we find that a 10% increase in subway extent causes about a 6% increase in subway ridership and has no effect on bus ridership.","[Gonzalez-Navarro, Marco] Univ Calif Berkeley, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, Giannini Hall 207, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Turner, Matthew A.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University,"Turner, MA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",marcog@berkeley.edu; matthew_turner@brown.edu,"gonzalez-navarro, marco/AAL-2475-2020","gonzalez-navarro, marco/0000-0002-4572-3398",Multi-Donor Trust Fund by the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Intemational Growth Centre; Ontario Work-Study program; Societe du Grand Paris; Property and Environment Research Center; Enaudi Institute of Economics and Finance,Multi-Donor Trust Fund by the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Intemational Growth Centre; Ontario Work-Study program; Societe du Grand Paris; Property and Environment Research Center; Enaudi Institute of Economics and Finance,"We are grateful to Fern Ramoutar, Mandy Saddradini, Mohamed Salat, and Farhan Yahya for their assistance compiling the subway data.

We hypothesize that daughters who are mothers have a stronger incentive than sons who are fathers to demonstrate to their children the appropriate way of caring for one's parents. The reason underlying this hypothesis is that women on average live longer than men, they tend to marry men who are older than they are and, thus, they are more likely than men to spend their last years without a spouse. Because it is more effective and less costly to care for parents if they live nearby, daughters with children do not move as far away from the parental home as sons with children or childless offspring. Data on the distance between the children's location and the parents' location extracted from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), in conjunction with data on selected demographic characteristics and institutional indicators taken from Eurostat, the OECD, and the World Bank, lend support to our hypothesis: compared to childless daughters, childless sons, and sons who are fathers, daughters who are mothers choose to live closer to their parents' home.

They help to determine who sees entrepreneurship as an available and desirable career path. Entrepreneurs use their contacts to raise funds for and to recruit employees and partners to their ventures. Social relationships also influence where and when entrepreneurs want to spend their leisure time. Because of these factors, entrepreneurs tend to found their firms in the places that they live (and in the industries in which they have been employed). That, in turn, implies that industries will tend to become and remain concentrated in a small number of places, even when firms do not benefit from this clustering.","[Sorenson, Olav] Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Sorenson, O (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",olav.sorenson@yale.edu,"Sorenson, Olav/ABE-5373-2020; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012","Sorenson, Olav/0000-0002-0599-6738;",,,,,83,40,48,3,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We examine how this disservice undermines the potential recreational services by measuring the human response to environmental risk using exogenous variation in the risk of contracting Lyme Disease. We find evidence that individuals substitute away from spending time outdoors when there is greater risk of Lyme Disease infection. On average individuals spent 1.54 fewer minutes per day outdoors at the average, 72 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed cases of Lyme Disease.

We attempt to explain such differences focusing on the interaction between institutional factors and population psychological characteristics. Constitutional provisions supporting economic freedom are our measure of the institutional context, whereas we proxy psychological characteristics with a country's endowment of agency culture. We apply an IV-GMM treatment to deal with endogeneity to a data set comprising 86 countries over the period 2004-2013, and we control for de facto variables and other factors that are likely to influence entrepreneurship. Our results demonstrate that agency culture is indeed an important predictor of entrepreneurship and that this effect is moderated by constitutional provisions supporting economic freedom. In particular, the impact of agency culture on entrepreneurship becomes stronger as a country expands the constitutional protection of economic rights.","[Carbonara, Emanuela; Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy; [Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Hien Thu Tran] Edge Hill Univ, FAS Business Sch, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England; [Potter, Jeff] Atof Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Bologna; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Edge Hill University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Melbourne,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, BO, Italy.",emanuela.carbonara@unibo.it; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it; martin.obschonka@gut.edu.au; hine.tran@edgehill.ac.uk; jeffpotter@cookingforgeeks.com; samg@austin.utexas.edu,"Gosling, Sam/AAL-5718-2020; Tran, Hien/HTM-2982-2023","Gosling, Sam/0000-0001-8970-591X; Tran, Hien/0000-0002-1399-9146; SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755; Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166",Saarland University within the framework of the program EXIST-Culture of Entrepreneurship-The Entrepreneurship University,Saarland University within the framework of the program EXIST-Culture of Entrepreneurship-The Entrepreneurship University,"The authors thank Tom Ginsburg for providing us with the data from the Comparative Constitutions Project, Jerg Gutmann and an anonymous reviewer for helpful suggestions.

An important challenge has been to combine efficiency and equity considerations in a single social welfare framework. The Chichilnisky criterion is one way to resolve this. We consider its implementation in the climate-economy model Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE), and compare results for different damage functions, namely the standard one in DICE and the one proposed by Weitzman implying potential large climate damages at high temperature increases. We calculate optimal climate policy for different parameter settings and compare the results with those under the green golden rule (only final utility matters) and classical utilitarianism (no discounting). Optimal emission abatement trajectories turn out to be very different between standard discounted utilitarianism, classical utilitarianism and Chichilnisky specifications. The results are very sensitive to the damage function, the climate sensitivity parameter and especially the Chichilnisky weight given to utility of generations in the far future. We discuss conditions and reasons for preferring either classical utilitarianism or the Chichilnisky criterion, and conclude that a critical factor is the time horizon used in climate policy analysis. Adopting sustainable preferences as formalized by the Chichilnisky criterion in climate policy analysis has the advantage that the very long-term implications of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the environment and human welfare are not downplayed.","[Botzen, W.

We develop a novel measure of bank interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loan portfolios, overlap based on industry and region, and different weights such as equal weights, size and relationships. We find that interconnectedness is driven mainly by bank diversification, less by bank size or overall loan market size. Interconnectedness is positively correlated with different bank-level systemic risk measures including SRISK, DIP and CoVaR, and such a positive correlation mainly arises from an elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during recessions. Overall, our results highlight that institution-level risk reduction through diversification ignores the negative externalities of an interconnected financial system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the relationship between electrification and children's nutritional status is rarely explored in the literature. We attempt to fill this lacuna by offering microeconometric evidence from rural Bangladesh, where a rapid expansion of electrification and significant improvement in children's nutritional status were observed in the past two decades. We find that access to electricity has a positive impact on the nutritional status of children under five as measured by height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) by around 0.1-0.2 points using five rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey from 2000 to 2014. Our results also appear to indicate that the quality of electricity may influence the size of this positive impact. While our analysis of causal pathways is limited by the data availability, it suggests that the positive impact of electrification partially comes from increased wealth. For some years, the positive impact can also be attributed to reduced fertility and information exposure through TV viewing. On the contrary, we find little evidence that the impact is attributable to the improvement of local health facilities. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating infrastructure programs such as rural electrification from a broad perspective as their impacts may go well beyond the economic benefits considered in a typical cost-benefit analysis. This in turn may encourage governments to invest more in basic infrastructure, which is still severely lacking in Bangladesh and many other countries in the rest of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

We highlight various fundamental choices in policy design including (1) the level of the initial carbon tax, (2) the growth rate of the carbon tax trajectory of over time, and (3) alternative ways for revenue recycling. Without revenue recycling, we find that generations born before the tax is introduced experience smaller welfare losses, or even gain, relative to future generations. For sufficiently low growth rates of the tax trajectory, the impacts for distant future generations decrease over time. For future generations born after the introduction of the tax, the negative welfare impacts are the smallest (largest) when revenues are recycled through lowering pre-existing capital income taxes (through per-capita lump-sum rebates).

Given the linkages between care provided by family members and the usage of paid services, we examine whether California's PFL program influenced nursing home utilization in California during the 1999 to 2008 period. This is the first empirical study to examine the effects of PFL on long-term care patterns. Multivariate difference-indifference estimates across alternative comparison groups provide consistent evidence that the implementation of PFL reduced the proportion of the elderly population in nursing homes by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points. Our preferred estimate, employing an empirically-matched group of control states, finds that PFL reduced nursing home usage by about 0.65 percentage points. For California, this represents an 11 percent relative decline in elderly nursing home utilization.

Sea level rise, ocean warming and acidification, and increased storminess threaten to alter or intensify biophysical coastal changes. Communities respond in ways that neither maximize total economic value nor apply the appropriate spatial scale of policy response. Focusing on coastline change, particularly in North Carolina, we synthesize modeling approaches and empirical studies to identify research that is needed to support coastal climate adaptation policy. Modeling coastlines as coupled human-natural systems explains historical patterns of coastline change, clarifies the need for empirical estimates, and provides a roadmap for interdisciplinary policy analysis. Despite the extensive literature on coastal amenities, hazards, and ex post policy evaluation, more empirical information is needed to parameterize coupled models of complex coastal environments facing climate change. Extending coupled models of coastal adaptation to incorporate spatial dynamics and market and nonmarket values highlights fundamental problems with current governance structures. We conclude that to maximize total economic value in the coastal zone, adaptation will require governance coordination across multiple levels, attention to intensive and extensive margins of adaptation, and trade-offs across market and nonmarket values. These findings echo recent advances in fisheries bioeconomics.","[Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Landry, Craig E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 301 Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Duke University,"Gopalakrishnan, S (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",gopalakrishnan.27@osu.edu; clandry@uga.edu; marsmith@duke.edu,"Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/K-4079-2012","Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/0000-0002-3593-0297","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy [EAR 0951802]","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy","Funding for S.

Conservative households often prefer women to stay home, which correlates to female employment and decision-making autonomy, affecting female physical mobility and female nutrition. Finding a suitable indicator for conservative outlook is difficult as we typically lack household-level 'value survey'. In the fast modernizing context of rural Bangladesh, wearing burqa (veil) is often perceived as an indicator of socially conservative outlook. Using this insight, we process the data from the second wave of the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) for 2015 to test the statistically robust association between household-level conservative outlook and gender-sensitive wellbeing indicators such as female employment, body mass index, and decision-making autonomy for the population of ever-married females aged 15-49 years old. After controlling for individual, household, and regional characteristics, and using sub-regional fixed effects, our findings suggest that living in conservative households is associated with lower probability of female employment. Females from conservative households are less likely to be in wage work or salaried jobs. The probability of being overweight is also higher for the females in conservative households as compared to non-conservative households. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Our novel approach is simple and yet flexible enough to accommodate the nature and extent of information spillover among several components of the global housing network. For a network of nine leading industrial economies, we unveil static and time-varying information spillover of REIT returns using total transfer entropy, pairwise net transfer entropy and directional (From, To) transfer entropy. Evidence suggests that the greatest pairwise transfer entropy is from the US to Australia, whereas France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Singapore are the largest information recipients in the network. The time-varying evolution of total transfer entropy also exhibits a declining trend for the integration of global housing market during our sample period.","[Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Marfatia, Hardik] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, BBH 344G,5500 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Pretoria","Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",jqwxnjq@casipm.ac.cn,"Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021; Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020","Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774152, 91546109]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7X0231505]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"The first author acknowledged the supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71774152, No. 91546109 and Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant: Y7X0231505).

J,"Dorosh, P; Thurlow, J",,,,"Dorosh, Paul; Thurlow, James",,,Beyond Agriculture Versus Non-Agriculture: Decomposing Sectoral Growth-Poverty Linkages in Five African Countries,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic growth; Poverty reduction; Agriculture; Non-agriculture; Africa,REDUCTION; POOR,"Africa's development debate is often cast as agriculture versus non-agriculture, with agriculture's proponents arguing that agricultural growth is more effective at reducing poverty. This dual economy perspective overlooks the heterogeneity within and synergies between these two broad sectors. Recent studies decompose agriculture into subsectors and find that agricultural growth led by smallholder farmers is even more effective at reducing poverty than larger-scale estate farms. In contrast, few studies estimate subsectoral growth-poverty linkages for non-agriculture. Yet we strongly expect, for example, that growth led by informal traders or foreign-owned mining companies will have quite different implications for poverty reduction. Different perspectives on what constitutes non-agriculture might therefore explain divergent views on its relative importance for poverty reduction. To address this gap in our understanding, we estimate sectoral poverty-growth elasticities using economy-wide models for five African countries. While our estimated elasticities are higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture as a whole, the extent to which this is true varies considerably across nonagricultural subsectors (and across countries). We find that the poverty-growth elasticities for trade and transport services and manufacturing, especially agro-processing, are often close to, and sometimes exceed, agriculture's. This means that growth led by these nonagricultural subsectors might be as effective as agriculture at reaching the poor. This confirms the need for a more nuanced treatment of non-agriculture in Africa's policy debate, and may explain conflicting perspectives on agriculture's role vis-a-vis non-agriculture.

To our knowledge, this is the first econometric study of the activities of agents in a country as underdeveloped as the DRC. More important than agents' personal characteristics, transactions are higher in low income, densely populated areas with high levels of commercial development, suggesting that the agent network has been best at supporting financial transactions among the urban poor. In addition, branding and effective liquidity management are strongly linked to agent activity. The results suggest that agents can be effective providers of basic financial services among the urban poor who lack suitable alternatives. But it remains to be seen how the agent banking model will play out in less densely populated areas of the DRC and other developing countries.

A novel feature of our NATO estimates is the spatial autoregressive (SAR) weighting of alliance spillovers of defense spending based on ally contiguity (augmented by US defense spending) and inverse distance between allies. The spatial models provide defense demand estimates that are amazingly consistent with those of the standard spillover model. In particular, free riding is prevalent in all three sets of estimates for the three sample periods and changing set of allies. In addition, the influences of the controls are generally robust, including the effect of the change in strategic doctrine in 1975 that augmented the importance of conventional weapons and, thus, spatial factors. We also present mutual assured destruction (MAD) era defense demand estimations dating back to 1960 and 1950 to show that spatial-based spillovers only matter in the post-MAD era after 1974.","[George, Justin] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",Michigan State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",kappiaru@msu.edu; tsandler@utdallas.edu,"George, Justin/ABB-4330-2021","George, Justin/0000-0002-7635-4556",Vibhooti Shukla Endowment; Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas,Vibhooti Shukla Endowment; Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas,Sandler's research was supported by the Vibhooti Shukla Endowment and the Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas.,,38,53,56,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

This paper evaluates the effect of the PFD to mitigate poverty among the state's rural Indigenous (Alaska Native) peoples: a population with historically high poverty rates living in a region with limited economic opportunities. Errors in recording PFD income in data used to calculate official poverty statistics cause them to misrepresent poverty in Alaska and understate the effect of the PFD. Estimating poverty rates with and without PFD income therefore requires reconstruction of family incomes from household-level data. Estimated poverty rates from reconstructed income show that the PFD has had a substantial, although diminishing mitigating effect on poverty for rural Indigenous families. The PFD has had a larger effect on poverty among children and elders than for the rural Alaska Native population as a whole. Alaska Native seniors, who receive additional sources of UBI derived primarily from resource rents besides the PFD, have seen a decline in poverty rates, while poverty rates for children have increased. Evidence has not appeared for commonly hypothesized potential adverse social and economic consequences of UBI. (C) 2018 The Author.

We account for the endogeneity of schooling using quantile instrumental variable estimation as developed in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Kowalski (). We use pooled data from four cross-sectional Household Income Expenditure Surveys. The results show that an extra year of schooling on the part of the most educated adult member in the household can increase welfare (proxied by real per capita consumption expenditure) by 3.8 percent on average. However, the effect varies considerably across the welfare distribution: At the lower end, around the 20th and 25th quantiles, an extra year of education increases welfare by 6 and 5 percent, respectively, while at the median it is around 3.5 percent. At the higher, 90th quantile it is much less, at 1 percent. Thus the marginal effect of schooling on welfare is significant and positive at all levels of the welfare distribution, but highest at the lower and middle quartiles. This result is different from findings in the literature that tend to show larger effects at higher quantiles, when endogeneity is uncorrected.","[Himaz, Rozana] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Himaz, Rozana] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Aturupana, Harsha] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Oxford Brookes University; University of Oxford; The World Bank,"Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.;Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rhimaz@brookes.ac.uk,,"Himaz, Rozana/0000-0003-0895-8144",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We explore this question in the context of options on the 30-year Treasury bond futures, allowing us to deduce restrictions that link the physical and risk-neutral return distributions. Our empirical results undermine the implications of the recovery theorem. First, we reject an implicit assumption of the recovery theorem that the martingale component of the stochastic discount factor is identical to unity. Second, we consider the restrictions between the physical and risk-neutral return moments when the recovery theorem holds, and reject them in both forecasting regressions and generalized method of moments estimations.","[Bakshi, Gurdip; Gao, Xiaohui] Univ Maryland, Smith Sch Business, 4426 Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Chabi-Yo, Fousseni] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Gao, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Smith Sch Business, 4426 Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xiaohui@rhsmith.umd.edu,"Chabi-Yo, Fousseni/AAB-6869-2021","Bakshi, Gurdip/0000-0003-0838-4128; Gao-Bakshi, Xiaohui/0000-0001-8303-0675",,,,,52,16,18,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Determining how close U.S. monetary policy has been to optimal in the past 20 years can give an idea of further gains that could be reaped by going beyond inflation targeting and committing to a Taylor-type rule, as favored by Meltzer. The author provides two examples: The flattening of the Phillips curve can be interpreted as a hallmark of optimal policy; the falling short of the 2 percent price level path established between 1995 and 2012 suggests room for improvement. Whether further gains from coordinating inflation expectations can be achieved is an important area of future research that surely will be influenced by Meltzer's work.","[Bullard, James] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Bullard, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Bullard, James B/L-8120-2016",,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Economists already understood a great deal about default, both theoretically and empirically, when the crisis began, but new research has moved the frontier further by improving data sources, building dynamic optimizing models of default, and explicitly addressing reverse causality between rising foreclosures and falling house prices. Mortgage defaults also featured prominently in early papers that pointed to subprime and other privately securitized mortgages as fundamental drivers of the housing boom, although this research has been criticized recently. Going forward, improvements to data and models will allow researchers to make progress on the two central questions in this literature. First, what are the relative contributions of adverse life events and negative equity to mortgage default? Second, why is default so rare, even among people with deep negative equity or acute financial distress?","[Foote, Christopher L.; Willen, Paul S.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; [Willen, Paul S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Foote, CL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",chris.foote@bos.frb.org; paul.willen@bos.frb.org,,,,,,,87,17,24,0,12,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

This economic relationship, which we termed 'Chimerica' in 2007, seemed likely to end as a result of the global financial crisis. Yet this did not happen. In this paper, we examine the evolution of Chimerica in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and explain how the stimulus policies of both the U.S. and China have contributed to its survival. We show how stimulus policies helped change Chimerica from a marriage of opposites to a marriage of equals. We then explain why this marriage is now destined for strife, in the form of a trade war between the U.S. and China. The consequences of such a trade war would deeply impact the global economy. We believe constructive negotiations on trade rebalancing and policy coordination are therefore needed to avoid a disruptive end to Chimerica.","[Ferguson, Niall] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Xiang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",seanxuxiang@126.com,,"Xu, Xiang/0000-0003-2566-5933",,,,,11,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Rather, it can choose a constrained discretionary regime that has rule-like attributes. To make monetary policy discretion more rule-like, it can be improved by (1) adopting a nominal anchor such as an inflation target, a monetary-policy strategy that has proved to be very successful in recent years, and (2) communication of a monetary-policy reaction process, especially through data-based forward guidance, in which the monetary-policy authorities describe how the future policy path will change as economic circumstances change.","[Mishkin, Frederic S.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Mishkin, FS (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",fsm3@columbia.edu,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Assessing quality of employment, beyond the perspective of income, to include other fundamental aspects of jobs - such as whether jobs are secure, provide benefits, or are satisfying - can shed light on the sustainability of these achievements. This is particularly pertinent given the region's current economic slowdown. Using harmonized data for 15 countries in Latin America, this paper connects the role of job quality with the recent process of inclusive growth across the region, and particularly with how individuals worked their way out of poverty. The paper first proposes a multi-dimensional measure for job quality, and then uses this measure to compare job quality across countries and over time. The paper also studies correlates of job quality and the relationship between job quality and poverty. One main finding is that job quality across the region began to increase in 2003. The best predictors of job quality are age, gender, firm size, formal employment, and union membership. Benefits and job satisfaction are the dimensions of job quality that are best correlated with not living in poverty.","[Brummund, Peter] Univ Alabama, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Mann, Christopher] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Rodriguez-Castelan, Carlos] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; The World Bank,"Brummund, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",pbrummund@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,44,3,4,3,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper therefore examines whether impacts of health insurance depend on households' access to informal insurance, as proxied for by mobile money usage. Based on high-frequency financial diaries data collected in rural Kenya, we find that households with weaker access to informal insurance cope with uninsured health shocks by lowering subsequent non-health expenditures by approximately 25 percent. These same households are able to smooth consumption when health shocks are insured, due to lower out-of-pocket health expenditures. In contrast, households with access to informal insurance are able to smooth consumption even in the absence of formal health insurance. For this latter group, health insurance increases healthcare utilization at formal clinics and does not crowd out gifts and remittances during weeks with health shocks. These findings provide guidance for insurance schemes aiming to target the most vulnerable populations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The main finding is that while these changes in environmental regulation have no impact on overall employment, they create significant, if modest, gaps in the demand for some green skills, especially those related to technical and engineering work tasks.","[Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, OFCE, Nice, France; [Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Nice, France; [Marin, Giovanni] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc & Polit, Urbino, Italy; [Consoli, Davide] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Ingenio, Valencia, Spain; [Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Urbino; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Vona, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, OFCE, Nice, France.;Vona, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Nice, France.",francesco.vona@sciencespo.fr; giovanni.marin@uniurb.it; davide.consoli@ingenio.upv.es; dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu,"Consoli, Davide/Q-7183-2019; Consoli, Davide/H-3313-2011; Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020; Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Consoli, Davide/0000-0002-7829-2838; Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537; Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration [320278]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [RYC-2011-07888]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","We wish to thank Dan Phaneuf, the editor, and three referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Piped water services in India are generally in the former category, but efforts are underway in some cities to shift to continuous supply. We use a matched-cohort research design to evaluate one such effort: an upgrade to continuous water service in a pilot zone of Hubli-Dharwad, India, while the rest of the city remained on intermittent services. We conducted a survey of similar to 4000 households with four rounds of data collection over 15 months. We evaluated the household-level net benefits, the equity of their distribution, and the affordability of water access under continuous supply. We also evaluated the project at the system-level (household and utility), estimating the net present value of the upgrade and the feasibility of scale-up to the entire city. We found positive net benefits for households overall, but uneven distribution of these benefits across socioeconomic strata. We also found that the costs of supply augmentation, a necessary step for scale-up, significantly reduced the project net present value. The potential for scale-up is thus unclear.

However, institutions are not always binding, and the degree of institutional bindingness varies across contexts. This article examines the bindingness of village elections in China. Through the lens of land expropriation in pe-urban villages and using survey data, we find that institutional bindingness operationalized in terms of the power structure within village leadership strongly shapes the processes and outcomes of land expropriations and therefore the quality of village governance. Moreover, village power structure depends on political bargaining between ordinary villagers and local states. Our findings contribute to the understanding of quasi-democratic institutions in authoritarian regimes by explicitly examining how institutional bindingness affects governance outcomes and how bindingness is endogenously determined.

Over the same period, the share of hired labor in agriculture decreased from 19.4% to 15.5%. A focus of this paper is to understand if the observed changes in wages and hired labor are in part due to agricultural productivity growth as reflected in increasing rice yield. To estimate the effects of agricultural productivity, we take advantage of an Upazila (subdistrict)-level panel data set from Bangladesh and exploit variations in rainfall across Upazilas and over time. We find that a positive rainfall shock has a significant positive effect on crop yields, wages, per capita household expenditure and labor supplied to market activities (including own farming). The effect on hired labor is, in contrast, negative and statistically significant. In a standard neoclassical model, higher agricultural productivity affects wages and hired labor through labor demand; a rightward (leftward) shift increases (reduces) both wages and the amount of hired labor. The finding of a negative hired labor response to agricultural productivity growth with a higher wage thus appears puzzling. We develop a model where heterogeneity in labor supply response due to differences in productivity in home goods production can lead to a decline in hired labor when agricultural productivity increases, even though the equilibrium wage increases. Since the poor in rural areas depend disproportionately on wage labor, a decline in hired labor may be interpreted by some as evidence of adverse effects on poverty and inequality. The theoretical analysis, however, shows that the poor benefit from agricultural productivity growth even when the labor supply responses result in a decline in hired labor.

Housing shortfalls and continued slum growth are consistently forecast. But what kinds of housing do current residents occupy? Do owners have better quality housing than tenants? How much do tenants pay and what features do they value? This study builds a demand-side understanding of housing using survey data from over 14,000 households in 15 Kenyan cities. Kenya's urban housing market is characterized by renting and sharing. Approximately 86 percent of residents are tenants; they outnumber owners in 14 of 15 cities. Sharing is ubiquitous households share houses, rooms, and/or facilities such as toilets and taps. In contrast to standard notions of an acceptable housing unit, only 18 percent of urban Kenyans live in a self-contained unit with a toilet, kitchen, electricity, and private water connection.The market is delivering two under-studied housing categories compounds and dormitories explicitly designed for sharing. These house 40 percent of urban households in individual rooms, but require sharing of toilets and water connections. Rents represent a significant share of household income, but indicate low ability to achieve ownership, if viewed as monthly mortgage payments. Hedonic regression analyses reveal the relative value of house features with electricity, kitchens and number of rooms emerging as important drivers of rent. Neighborhood conditions, such as lack of flooding and perceived safety, and neighborhood level infrastructure and services, such as garbage collection and access to transport, also have positive impacts upon rents. Our analysis urges a rethinking of housing policies, including reevaluation of what type of housing is deemed acceptable and affordable for very low income urban residents. It underscores the need to develop more and better-quality rental housing and calls for a reassessment of housing and infrastructure investment programs, as well as more creative approaches for expanding home ownership.

Policymakers require objective evidence to base decisions on which public policies or investments to pursue. In this paper we develop an economy-wide approach to assessing public investments in tourism. The approach is powerful in that it considers all intersectoral linkages that are critical for tourism-sector analysis. This framework is linked to a microsimulation module that enables estimation of household-level and destination-specific impacts and the distribution of benefits. To illustrate the framework and the insights it can generate, we apply it to a public investment in Belize's Cayo District. Our findings show that the overall level of economic activity increases while an appreciation of the real regional exchange rate results in slower growth in traditional nontourism exports. Greater availability of capital and labor to meet increased demand would reduce this effect. The investment results in a reduction in the poverty headcount on the order of 0.7 percentage points, though there is a small increase in inequality that is a function of the skill requirements of the new positions created as a result of the investment.","[Banerjee, Onil; Moreda, Adela] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Cicowiez, Martin] Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Morris, Emily J.] UCL, London, England",Inter-American Development Bank; National University of La Plata; University of London; University College London,"Banerjee, O (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",onilb@iadb.org,"Morris, Emily/JRY-8556-2023; Morris, Emily/HZJ-5380-2023","Morris, Emily/0000-0002-9171-1080; Cicowiez, Martin/0000-0001-6616-7370",Inter-American Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank,This study was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank.,,44,6,6,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Yet little research measures change in the policy preferences of primary electorates to evaluate the connection directly. We create the first explicit measures of the preferences of primary voters over the last 60 years using a Bayesian item-response theory model. Although the overall distribution of population preferences has changed little, the preferences of primary voters are now much more related to the party of the primary that they attend. We show that liberals are much more likely to turn out in Democratic primaries and conservatives are much more likely to turn out in Republican primaries. We estimate that the divergence of primary from general electorates is six times larger in 2012 than in 1958 owing to this primary sorting. This trend began with the emergence of the Southern Republicans. As the Republican party became viable, conservative Southerners switched to Republican primaries leading to a leftward shift in Democratic primary electorates. Nationwide, primary sorting began sometime after it began in the South. We speculate that Southern realignment played a clarifying role that contributed to subsequent sorting of primary electorates nationwide.","[Hill, Seth J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr 0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tausanovitch, Chris] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, POB 951472, Los Angeles, CA 90065 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tausanovitch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, POB 951472, Los Angeles, CA 90065 USA.",sjhill@ucsd.edu; ctausanovitch@ucla.edu,"Tausanovitch, Chris/KBB-2894-2024","Tausanovitch, Chris/0000-0003-3401-3427",,,,,42,8,13,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,107,132,,10.1007/s11127-017-0478-0,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438459400007,0

We conduct a series of laboratory experiments to test this view. We find that when there is no competition and no eminent domain, land assembly suffers from costly delay and failed assembly: participants lose 18.8% of the available surplus on average. Much of the inefficiency is due to low offers from the buyers (buyer holdout) rather than strategic holdout among sellers. When buyers can exercise eminent domain the participants lose 19.4% of the surplus on average. This loss comes from spending money to influence the fair market price and forcing sellers to sell even when the sellers value the property more than the buyer. Introducing weak competition in the form of a less valuable substitute parcel of land reduces delay by 35.7% and virtually eliminates assembly failure, so that only 10.1% of the surplus is lost on average.","[Winn, Abel M.] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [McCarter, Matthew W.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Winn, AM (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",winn@chapman.edu,"McCarter, Matthew W/I-6429-2013",,International Foundation of Research in Experimental Economics (IFREE Grant) [121],International Foundation of Research in Experimental Economics (IFREE Grant),Portions of this research were completed while the second author was Visiting John Angus Erskine Fellow at University of Canterbury.

The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper soft measures and more costly hard irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.","[Bosello, Francesco; Campagnolo, Lorenza; Eboli, Fabio] CMCC Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco; Campagnolo, Lorenza; Eboli, Fabio] FEEM, Venice, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy; [Cervigni, Raffaello] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Fondazione Mattei; University of Milan; The World Bank,"Campagnolo, L (通讯作者)，CMCC Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy.;Campagnolo, L (通讯作者)，FEEM, Venice, Italy.",lorenza.campagnolo@feem.it,"Campagnolo, Lorenza/ABE-7927-2020; Bosello, Francesco/ABE-6686-2020; eboli, fabio/ABF-9764-2021; Cervigni, Raffaello/M-9255-2015","Campagnolo, Lorenza/0000-0001-7031-8055; eboli, fabio/0000-0003-3617-9543; Cervigni, Raffaello/0000-0002-2602-6482",World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"This work is an elaboration of the economic assessment part of the Nigerian Climate Risk Analysis consulting report prepared for the World Bank, whose financial support is gratefully acknowledged.

Insurance agents and brokers play a significant role in helping employers navigate these problems. However, little is known about the relations between the structure of the agent/broker market and access and affordability of insurance. This article aims to fill this gap by investigating the influence of agents/brokers on health insurance offering decisions of small firms, which are particularly vulnerable to problems of financing health insurance. Using a unique membership database from the National Association of Health Underwriters together with a nationally representative survey of employers, we find that small firms in more competitive agent/broker markets are more likely to offer health insurance and at lower premiums. Moreover, premiums are less dispersed in more competitive agent/broker markets.","[Karaca-Mandic, Pinar; Feldman, Roger] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Karaca-Mandic, Pinar] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Graven, Peter] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Oregon Health & Science University,"Karaca-Mandic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Karaca-Mandic, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pkmandic@umn.edu; feldm002@umn.edu; graven@ohsu.edu,,,,,,,55,5,6,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

But what do we know about public apologies for large scale man-made disasters? Herein we report on results from an experiment with apologies in a multilateral setting: a firm-caused environmental disaster. Subjects read about an oil spill scenario, and learned whether the oil firm made a full apology, a partial apology, or no apology, and whether the firm had a good, bad, or no environmental reputation. A partial apology is one that fails to accept full material responsibility for damages, such as by shifting the blame to another party. We find that full apologies and better reputation reduce the demand for punishment. However, full apologies and reputation are substitutes, with reputation being significantly more important. Additionally, apologies do not reduce the demand for compensation and may increase it if the firm is clearly a bad actor, or if admission of guilt is the only information subjects have. Our results help explain corporate social responsibility investments and greenwashing, and why many public apologies over an environmental disaster are only partial apologies.","[Gilbert, Ben] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [James, Alexander] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Colorado School of Mines; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Wyoming,"James, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",alex.james@uaa.alaska.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0001-5729-5047",,,,,49,11,12,3,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We simulated the impacts arising from the Energy Modeling Forum's broad range of carbon taxes under three revenue recycling options - lump sum redistributions, capital tax reductions, and labor tax cuts. We examined their consequences for industry prices and quantities, for the overall economy, and for the welfare of households, individuals, and society, the latter in terms of efficiency and equity. We rank recycling mechanisms from most to least favorable in terms of the magnitudes of their impacts on net social welfare - efficiency net of equity - recognizing that other objectives may be more important to policy makers and the public. Finally, we and the EMF 32 effort focus only on the economic effects of carbon taxation and revenue recycling; the environmental benefits arising from emissions reductions are not within our scope of study. We find CO2 emissions abatement to be invariant to the chosen recycling scheme. This means that policy makers need not compromise their environmental objectives when designing carbon tax swap options. We also find additional emissions reductions beyond the scope of coverage and points of taxation. Reducing capital taxes promotes new saving, investment and capital formation and is the most favorable recycling mechanism. In 2010 dollars, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $0.19 to $3.90 depending on the path of carbon prices. Reducing labor taxes promotes consumption and work through real-wage incentives and is the next most favorable recycling scheme. Here, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $11.09 to $16.49 depending on the carbon tax trajectory. Lump sum redistribution of carbon tax revenues is the least favorable recycling option. It incentivizes neither capital nor labor. Consequently, the damages to the economy and welfare are the greatest among the three schemes. With lump sum recycling, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $37.15 to $43.61 as carbon taxation becomes more aggressive. While this ranking is common among the participating EMF 32 models, the spread in our results is the greatest in comparison which we attribute to the substitution possibilities inherent in IGEM's econometrics, the absence of barriers to factor mobility, and likely differences in the manner in which tax incentives are structured. We find welfare gains are possible under capital and labor tax recycling when emissions accounting is viewed from a top-down rather than a bottom-up perspective and carbon pricing is at an economy-wide average. However, these gains occur at the expense of abatement. We find capital tax recycling to be regressive while labor tax recycling is progressive as is redistribution through lump sums. Moreover, we find that the lump sum mechanism provides the best means for sheltering the poorest from the welfare consequences of carbon taxation. Thus, promoting capital formation is the best use of carbon tax revenues in terms of reducing the magnitudes of welfare losses while the lump sum and labor tax options are the best uses for reducing inequality.","[Jorgenson, Dale W.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 122, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goettle, Richard J.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Goettle, Richard J.] Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA; [Ho, Mun S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, 29 Oxford St,G2C, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, 426 Eggars Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Harvard University; Northeastern University; Harvard University; Brookings Institution; Syracuse University,"Goettle, RJ (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Goettle, RJ (通讯作者)，Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA.",r.goettle@northeastern.edu,"Ho, Mun/ABI-4730-2020",,,,,,15,14,14,1,31,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this article investigates the impacts of preference for transit and other residential preferences on residential location choice. Employing preference ranking, logistic regression and ANOVA tests on survey data from the Oslo metropolitan area, we find that individuals with simultaneously high preference for transit and low preference for attributes related to households with children are likely to reside in transit-friendly neighborhoods. Transit preference, while important in residential choice, is more so as second tier after other more important preferences related to lifecycle/demographics are satisfied. Individuals who prefer transit but live in transit-poor zones tend to have higher preference for private garden, a larger number of children, lower income, and are older. Variations in access to transit and transit preference have significant influences on transit use. The results of qualitative interviews are also consistent with these findings and substantiate the mechanism by which the built environment and travel preference affect residential and travel choices.","[Wolday, Fitwi] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway; [Cao, Jason] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Naess, Petter] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Wolday, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway.",hamdwold@nmbu.no; cao@tunn.edu; petter.nass@nmbu.no,"Wolday, Fitwi/IUP-5835-2023; Cao, Jason/AAE-4374-2020","Cao, Xinyu/0000-0002-4403-9762",Research Council Norway [230313]; US National Science Foundation (SRN) [1444745],Research Council Norway(Research Council of Norway); US National Science Foundation (SRN),Research Council Norway funded the study on which this paper is based (grant no. 230313).

We test this relationship empirically, examining the impact of soil conservation training sessions on female agricultural labor contributions within households in Zambia. Moreover, we explore the short-run effects of increased female agricultural productivity on female empowerment through measurement of changes in gender-specific resource allocations within the household. The extension of funding of conservation farming (CF) training sessions in 2007 in specific districts in Zambia provides variation in CF take-up. We use this variation to implement a difference-in-differences strategy on a number of datasets. Our results suggest that expansion of funding for CF training sessions increased take-up of CF, increased female labor hours, and shifted household expenditures toward goods associated more strongly with female preferences than male preferences. These results show the importance of understanding the impact of development programs, specifically promotion of agricultural technologies, on household gender dynamics.","[Carney, Conor] Brattle Grp, Boston, MA USA; [Carney, Monica Harber] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",The Brattle Group; College of the Holy Cross,"Carney, MH (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",mcarney@holycross.edu,"Carney, Monica/HNJ-0380-2023",,United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER),United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER).,,16,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper considers a three-factor, three-industry model, and demonstrates that endowment differences between countries can cause disparities in their wage rates and the prices of the nontraded good.

Similar to prior papers, we find a positive association between a bank's equity stake in a borrowing firm and lending to that firm. While such a positive cross-sectional correlation may be due to equity stakes benefiting lending, it may also be driven by endogeneity. To distinguish the two explanations, we study a German tax reform that permitted banks to sell their equity stakes tax-free. After the reform, many banks sold their equity stakes, but did not reduce lending to the firms. This observation is robust to several alternative model specifications, control groups, and time windows.

Scientists and policymakers have proposed various strategies for managing risks, with limited success. In this study we consider two such strategies, specifically drought tolerant rice and weather index insurance. While neither drought tolerant cultivars nor weather index insurance products are perfect solutions for adequately managing drought risk in and of themselves, there is scope to exploit the benefits of each and bundle them into a complementary risk management product, specifically through proper index calibration and an optimized insurance design. In this study, we explore preferences for such a complementary risk management product using discrete choice experiments in Odisha, India. We are able to estimate the added value that farmers perceive in the bundled product above and beyond the value associated with each of the independent products. We also show that valuations are very sensitive to the basis risk implied by the insurance product, with farmers less enthusiastic about risk management products that leave significant risks uninsured.

In this paper, aiming to help improving sustainability in multimodal transportation through BSS, we perform a systematic data analysis to examine underlying patterns and characteristics of the system dynamics in a bikeshare network and to acquire implications of the patterns and characteristics for decision making. As a case study, we use trip history data from the Capital Bikeshare system in the Washington DC area and some additional data sources. The study covers seven important aspects of bikeshare transportation systems, which are respectively trip demand and flow, operating activities, use and idle times, trip purpose, origin-destination flows, mobility, and safety. For these aspects, by using appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques, we investigate travel patterns and characteristics of BSS from data to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the inputs from key stakeholders on main measures of effectiveness such as trip costs, mobility, safety, quality of service, and operational efficiency, where key stakeholders include road users, system operators, and city. We also disclose some new patterns and characteristics of BSS to advance the knowledge on travel behaviors. Finally, we briefly summarize our findings and discuss the implications of the patterns and characteristics for data-driven decision supports from the relations between BSS and key stakeholders for promoting bikeshare utilization and transforming urban transportation to be more sustainable.","[Xie, Xiao-Feng; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher] WIOMAX LLC, POB 540, Rockville, MD 20848 USA",,"Xie, XF (通讯作者)，WIOMAX LLC, POB 540, Rockville, MD 20848 USA.",xie@wiomax.com; wang@wiomax.com,"Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019; Xie, Xiao-Feng/AAH-4010-2019; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher/B-1038-2009","Xie, Xiao-Feng/0000-0002-7970-2974; Wang, Zunjing Jenipher/0000-0001-9518-6829",,,,,82,29,36,5,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachers' guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combination-PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plans-was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachers' guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.

Eschewing the need to endow a group with its own preferences, this paper argues that an operational notion of coordination can serve such a role. Coordination is an intrinsically group-level concept that is complementary to, but distinct from, the intrinsically individual notion of performance. Both group rationality as manifest by coordination and individual rationality as manifest by performance are necessary for a full understanding of group behavior in social environments. Conditional game theory provides a flexible mathematical framework within which individuals may modulate their preferences in response to the social influence that others exert on them. As social influence diffuses throughout a social network, a comprehensive social model emerges that provides an operational definition of group rationality as well as an operational concept of augmented individual rationality that together establish a concept of coordinated reasoning.","[Stirling, Wynn C.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Tummolini, Luca] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Cognit Sci & Techonol, Rome, Italy",Brigham Young University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Stirling, WC (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",wynn_stirling@byu.edu; luca.tummolini@istc.cnr.it,"Tummolini, Luca/A-5086-2010","Tummolini, Luca/0000-0001-7791-0457",,,,,31,1,1,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequalitynot the actual levelcorrelates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of perceived inequality.","[Gimpelson, Vladimir] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Gimpelson, Vladimir] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Treisman, Daniel] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Treisman, Daniel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Treisman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",treisman@polisci.ucla.edu,"Gimpelson, Vladimir/F-8863-2016","Gimpelson, Vladimir/0000-0003-3952-4701",NRU HSE Basic Research Program; UCLA College of Letters and Sciences,NRU HSE Basic Research Program; UCLA College of Letters and Sciences,"V.

Before a lawsuit filing, firms at higher risk of litigation have lower credit ratings, are more likely to be rated speculative grade, pay higher yields on loans and bonds, and are less likely to rely on debt financing. At the time of the lawsuit resolution, settlement costs have an additional effect on firm credit quality.

I approximate the value of co-benefits to these policies that arise from concomitant reductions in nongreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the CO-Benefits Risk Assessment model (COBRA). There is significant heterogeneity in costs and co-benefits from climate policies across space and income. Policy costs are generally less than 0.5% in equivalent variation terms (between a few tens of dollars and several hundred per household, depending on the income quintile), can be fully neutralized for the lowest-quintile households at a modest increase in overall policy cost, and tend to be lower for upper-quintile households in coastal regions. The policy co-benefit values range widely across regions, approximately $150-1250 per household, exceeding the gross cost of the policy for many households, particularly those in the Midwest. Last, I identify a marginal welfare cost of $58/tCO(2) and a marginal co-benefit of $31/tCO(2) at a national level over all households, which implies a required climate benefit of $27/tCO(2) or less to justify the level of abatement achieved by a $25/tCO(2) tax growing at 5%.","[Woollacott, Jared] RTI Int, 3040 East Cornwallis Rd,12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Woollacott, J (通讯作者)，RTI Int, 3040 East Cornwallis Rd,12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",Jwoollacott@rti.org,,,,,,,19,13,14,6,52,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

J,"Azzimonti, M",,,,"Azzimonti, Marina",,,Partisan conflict and private investment,JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNCERTAINTY,"American politics have been characterized by a high degree of partisan conflict in recent years. Combined with a divided government, this has led not only to significant Congressional gridlock, but also to spells of high fiscal policy uncertainty. The unusually slow recovery from the Great Recession during the same period suggests the possibility that the two phenomena may be related. In this paper, I investigate the hypothesis that political discord depresses private investment. To this end, I construct a novel high-frequency indicator of partisan conflict. The partisan conflict index (PCI) uses a semantic search methodology to measure the frequency of newspaper articles reporting lawmakers' disagreement about policy. I find a negative relationship between the PCI and aggregate investment in the US. Moreover, the decline is persistent, which may help explain the slow recovery observed since the 2007 recession ended. Partisan conflict is also associated with lower capital investment rates at the firm level, even when economic policy uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions are controlled for. I estimate that about 27% of the decline in corporate investment between 2007-2009 can be attributed to a rise in partisan conflict. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Absent the credit supply contraction, annual rent growth would have been 2.1 percentage points lower over 2010-2014 in MSAs in which lending standards rose from their 2008 levels.","[Gete, Pedro] IE Business Sch, Maria de Molina 12, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Reher, Michael] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",IE University; Harvard University,"Gete, P (通讯作者)，IE Business Sch, Maria de Molina 12, Madrid 28006, Spain.",pedro.gete@ie.edu,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-53022],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We thank Sumit Agarwal, Jim Albrecht, Brent Ambrose, Elliot Anenberg, Neil Bhutta, John Campbell, Mark Carey, Brian Chen, Stijn Claessens, Behzad Diba, Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Ricardo Correa, Edward DeMarco, Jihad Dragher, Martin Evans, Ammar Farooq, Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, Benjamin Friedman, Carlos Garriga, Lei Ge, Ed Glaeser, Laurie Goodman, Cindy Gross, Sam Hanson, John Haltiwanger, Anil Jain, John Krainer, Tim Landvoight, Steven Laufer, John Leahy, Deborah Lucas, David Marques-Ibanez, Atif Mian, Raven Molloy, Whitney Newey, Jonathan Parker, Franco Peracchi, Daniel Ringo, John Rogers, Kevin Roshak, Antoinette Schoar, Kamila Sommer, Viktors Stebunovs, Jeremy Stein, Philip Strahan, Susan Vroman, Nancy Wallace, and Paul Willen and anonymous referees and seminar participants at the 2016 AREUEA Conference, 2016 MIT Golub Center Conference, 2017 ASSA, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Georgetown, and Harvard for comments.

If the central bank has no fiscal support, reducing reserves is optimal.

Our model underscores the importance of the following determinants of structural change: (i) productivity growth in the agricultural sector; (ii) productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector and; (iii) the terms of trade. Public investment enhances productivity growth in all sectors but when it is financed by foreign inflows, it also causes a real exchange rate appreciation leading to a contraction in the open modern sector. These results provide a partial explanation for recent patterns of growth in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa where the non-tradables or what we call the in-between sector has expanded more rapidly than the tradable sector.

The research and development sector is represented by an aggregate stock of energy-saving technology, which acts as a weak substitute with a polluting resource in the energy generation sector. Using this model, we analytically show how ITC occurs and affects the cost of a carbon tax. Applying quantitative estimates of the size of ITC to numerical simulations calibrated to the US economy, we find that existing empirical evidence can reduce the welfare cost of environmental tax reform by 12%. Our tests of alternative parameters show that this result is highly sensitive to the assumptions used, suggesting that ITC could result in much larger reductions in cost.","[Liu, Antung Anthony] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Yamagami, Hiroaki] Seikei Univ, 3-3-1 Kichijoji Kitamachi, Musashino, Tokyo 1808633, Japan; [Yamagami, Hiroaki] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Seikei University,"Liu, AA (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",aaliu@indiana.edu; yamagami@econ.seikei.ac.jp,"Yamagami, Hiroaki/AER-7802-2022","Yamagami, Hiroaki/0000-0003-0174-7811",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K17055]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17055] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Funding was provided from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (No. 15K17055).,,28,5,5,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

One way that local elites capture community-driven development is to limit information about opportunities for citizens to shape group decisions. We investigate whether sending citizens targeted and timely information about when and how they can participate in the planning of community-driven development projects increases knowledge, participation, and satisfaction with local institutions. We implemented a pre-registered randomized field experiment in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority that involved sending residents in randomly selected villages near Bwindi National Park approximately 60 messages by mobile phone over eight months about how a park-sponsored revenue sharing program worked and how and when residents could participate. We do not find evidence that the information increased perceived knowledge, participation, perceived efficacy, or satisfaction with local institutions. Exploratory findings suggest that among women, who are often disenfranchised in Ugandan society, the information treatment backfired related to perceived opportunities to participate. More positively, we find that reaching more people in a community with information led to promising results related to participation and satisfaction with the park. We conclude that informational treatments are unlikely to empower participation on average, unless they are deployed broadly and in ways that promote collective action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The negative effects of segregation are somewhat larger for Latinos than for African Americans.

We present a causal framework that can be used to identify leaks and blockages in the information production and dissemination process in such programs. We conceptualize the information pipeline as a series of connected nodes, each of which constitutes a possible point of blockage. We apply the framework to a field-experimental evaluation of a program that provided households in Bangalore, India, with advance notification of intermittently provided piped water. Our study detected no impacts on household wait times for water or on how citizens viewed the state, but found that notifications reduced stress. Our framework reveals that, in our case, noncompliance among human intermediaries and asymmetric gender relations contributed in large part to these null-to-modest results. Diagnostic frameworks like this should be used more extensively in development research to better understand the mechanisms responsible for program success and failure, to identify subgroups that actually received the intended treatment, and to identify potential leaks and blockages when replicating existing programs in new settings.

Longer statehood experience gives countries more time to adapt their laws to local needs, provided the legal system is adaptable. We find that, relative to British common law countries with the most flexible laws, German and Scandinavian civil law countries initially exhibit lower financial development. However, as their history of statehood grows longer, financial development improves in countries with adaptable laws such as the German and Scandinavian civil law countries. This is not the case in French civil law countries with more rigid legal systems. Our results mainly show no or at most a weakly negative effect of French civil law legal origin on financial development.

Benefit transfer functions are frequently specified based on statistical considerations alone. However, such a purely statistical approach can lead to willingness-to-pay functions that fail to satisfy some aspects of theoretical consistency that may be especially important for policy evaluations. In this paper, we examine several previous meta-analyses of nonmarket valuation studies in light of the adding-up condition, which is one important aspect of theoretical validity. We then use meta-regression to estimate a new willingness-to-pay function for surface water quality improvements intended to be used for benefit transfers. We estimate the meta-regression model using summary results from 51 previously published stated preference studies. An important feature of our approach is that we develop the meta-regression estimating equation to ensure that the resulting benefit transfer function will necessarily comply with the adding-up condition. This is achieved by first specifying a marginal willingness-to-pay function and then deriving an expression for total willingness-to-pay. This leads to a non-linear estimating equation, so we estimate the parameters of the model using non-linear least squares. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approach relative to other structural approaches, and we compare our empirical results to a more traditional nonstructural meta-regression model. Finally, we examine the quantitative importance of imposing the adding-up condition in our case study by performing some illustrative calculations of willingness-to-pay for hypothetical water quality improvements using both structural and non-structural models.","[Newbold, Stephen C.; Massey, D.

Insights from a Semiparametric Approach to Modeling Firm Performance,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; LABOR; REGRESSION; PRODUCTIVITY; MARKET; UNEMPLOYMENT; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; CHINA,"There is a large and growing literature on the impact of institutional quality on economic performance and the broad consensus is that good institutions facilitate better economic performance. The literature that provides micro-level support for the policy discourse about institutional quality does not, however, account for significant intra-country variation in reactions of firms to changes in business environments, even within the same industry, and it generally ignores the possibility that the impact of institutional quality on firm performance may not be neutral. In this paper, we analyze the impact of institutions on firm performance using an approach that enables us to overcome these problems with the stylized approach. Using cross-country firm-level data, we demonstrate that not only does the marginal impact of institutional quality vary significantly within countries, but also that the impact is economically significant only at the two extremes of the distribution. We view this as prima facie evidence that policies that tinker with institutional quality on the basis of the popular wisdom about the impact of these institutions on the average firm may not have the desired or expected impact, at least at the micro level.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] Inst Labor Econ, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Dimova, Ralitza] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY USA; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Sheffield; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Manchester; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Shanghai University,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.k.bhaumik@sheffield.ac.uk,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; Bhaumik, Sumon/0000-0002-4459-3659",,,,,44,13,13,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

As a consequence, it is estimated that more than 60 million children in rural China are left behind and live with relatives, typically their paternal grandparents. These children are called Left Behind Children (LBCs). There are concerns about the potential negative effects of parental migration on the academic performance of the LBCs that could be due to the absence of parental care. However, it might also be that when a child's parents work away from home, their remittances can increase the household's income and provide more resources and that this can lead to better academic performance. Hence, the net impact of out-migration on the academic performance of LBCs is unclear. This paper examines changes in academic performance before and after the parents of students out-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 13,000 students at 130 rural primary schools in ethnic minority areas of rural China. Using difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental migration has significant, positive impacts on the academic performance of LBCs (which we measure using standardised English test scores). Heterogeneous analysis using our data demonstrates that the positive impact on LBCs is greater for poorer performing students.","[Bai, Yu; Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, CEEE, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; Stanford University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Bai, Yu/AAO-2988-2020; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Bai, Yu/0000-0002-6052-7766;","Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012, 71473240]; 111 Project [B16031]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012,71473240]; and 111 Project [B16031].",,50,53,59,11,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In Ecuador, the administration of Rafael Correa has invested substantially in both new infrastructure and community level training in order to steer world heritage visitors into a more diversified tourist sector. Our research examined the attempt of one community at the crater lake Quilotoa (Cotopaxi province) to maintain control of their economy in the face of increased state investments. We asked, under what circumstances is a community able to both define and defend a zone of locally managed economic development? To answer the question, we carried out a participatory GIS mapping project focused on sites of conflict and community assemblies and supplemented the mapping with an economic survey and detailed career histories. Our research finds that, since 1988, cycles of conflicts within the community of Quilotoa and between Quilotoa and its neighbors came to define an effective, yet informal, territorial boundary within which residents were highly committed to mobilize to defend their work and investments. Interviews show the importance of territory as political resources used by the community to escalate commercial conflicts into matters of wide public concern and ultimately establish the institutional basis of non-agricultural work.

The choice of a single mandate depends on the trade openness and the credibility. Reduced-form empirical results show as central banks become less credible, they are more likely to adopt a pegged exchange rate, and the tendency to peg depends on trade openness. In a model with loose commitment, as credibility falls, either an inflation target or a pegged exchange rate is more likely to be adopted.

Debate continues on what domains constitute women's empowerment and how to measure empowerment across countries. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the most widely available source of data on women's empowerment. However, measurement invariance often is assumed, but not tested. We used DHS data from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to test factor structure and measurement invariance of women's empowerment among married women ages 15-49. Factor analysis confirmed a three-latent-domain model of women's empowerment in each country capturing women's human/social assets, gender attitudes related to wife abuse, and women's participation in household decisions. Multi-country confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) identified an invariant three-factor model of women's empowerment and a subset of country-specific items. Our results offer a standardized, invariant measure of women's empowerment that can be applied to monitor women's empowerment cross-nationally in East Africa, and possibly beyond.

J,"St Clair, T; Guzman, JPM",,,,"St Clair, Travis; Guzman, Juan Pablo Martinez",,,Contribution volatility and public pension reform,JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public pensions; contribution volatility; defined benefit plans; pension reform,,"In the wake of the economic downturn of 2008-2009, researchers and policymakers have focused considerable attention on the extent of unfunded liabilities in US public sector pension plans and the implications for the long term fiscal sustainability of state and local governments. In response to the growth in liabilities, many states have introduced legislation that cuts back on defined benefit (DB) plan commitments, in some cases even shifting the pension system from a DB to a defined contribution or hybrid plan. This paper explores the factors that have led states to engage in pension reform, focusing particular attention on one factor that has only recently gained attention in the research literature: contribution volatility. While unfunded liabilities have significant long-term solvency implications, in the short term fluctuations in the amount of required contributions pose substantial difficulties for the ability of plan sponsors to balance budgets and engage in strategic planning. We begin by quantifying the volatility in the required contributions US states were expected to make between 2001 and 2013 and comparing the volatility of pension spending to other relevant tax and spending measures. Next, we describe the various types of pension reforms that states have implemented and examine the fiscal pressures facing those states that have engaged in reform. States with greater fluctuations in their required payments have been more likely to reduce benefits and increase employee contributions; they have also been more likely to institute these reforms sooner.","[St Clair, Travis; Guzman, Juan Pablo Martinez] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"St Clair, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",tstclair@umd.edu; jpmart04@umd.edu,,"Martinez Guzman, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-3457-8703",,,,,18,9,12,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

These programs deploy three types of public-goods contribution mechanisms: voluntary contribution, green tariff, and all-or-nothing green tariff (Kotchen and Moore, 2007). We extend the theoretical understanding of the all-or-nothing green tariff mechanism by showing that an assumption of warm-glow preferences is needed to explain widespread participation in programs deploying this mechanism. We conduct the first experimental test to compare the revenue generating capacity of a pure public good (based on the voluntary contribution mechanism) and an impure public good (based on the green tariff mechanism). In experimental play, the voluntary contribution mechanism raises 50% more revenue than the green tariff mechanism. With the all-or-nothing green tariff, experimental play and regression estimates show that a warm-glow preference positively affects participation, as predicted by the theory.","[Mitra, Arnab] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Moore, Michael R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Portland State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Mitra, A (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",amitra@pdx.edu,,,Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan; Portland State University,Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan; Portland State University,"The authors thank Jim Andreoni, Erin Krupka, Tom Lyon, Christian Vossler, and two anonymous referees for insightful suggestions.

Associated macro models were mostly based on a single country. This paper sheds light on several aspects of pension economics when these assumptions do not hold using-to our knowledge-the first multi-country model of procrastinating households. Our focus is on the interaction between the share of procrastinators in a country, the speed and extent of population aging, and the size of an existing PAYG-DB pension system. Starting from the insight that procrastination reduces the volume of savings, we focus on three questions that are particularly relevant for the quickly aging Asian economies: What are the consequences for the balance between pay-as-you-go and fully funded pension systems? Where will retirement savings be invested in a globally linked world with very different pension systems and demographics?

The efficiency of asset prices is linked to the efficiency of the asset management market: if investors can find managers more easily, more money is allocated to active management, fees are lower, and asset prices are more efficient. Informed managers outperform after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager's performance depends on the number of noise allocators. Small investors should remain uninformed, but large and sophisticated investors benefit from searching for informed active managers since their search cost is low relative to capital.

To do so requires information on the nature and magnitude of market failures on the one hand, and government's capacity to redress them successfully on the other. This article reviews perspectives on vertical (sectoral) and horizontal (factor markets, cluster) policies with a view to both criteria. We first argue that the case for either vertical or horizontal policies cannot be made on the basis of the likelihood of successful implementation: for instance, educational policies and picking the winner types of policies both run the risks of capture and incompetent execution. However, the economics profession has been able to establish more convincing market failures for horizontal policies than for vertical policies. Most of the recent approaches to identifying failures around particular goods are of limited help. Hence, for a given difficulty of execution, the former are generally preferred. A second critical message is that improving the quality of governance in terms of collecting information, coordination ability, and defending against capture is critical to the successful implementation of productivity policies and should be central on the policy agenda.","[Maloney, William F.] World Bank Grp, Equitable Growth Finance & Inst Practice Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nayyar, Gaurav] World Bank Grp, Finance Competitiveness & Innovat Global Practice, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Maloney, WF (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Equitable Growth Finance & Inst Practice Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",wmaloney@worldbank.org,,,,,,,91,5,8,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

The tests include merger-firm fixed effects to exploit the variation in changes to coworkers across branches of the same firm. The probability of an advisor committing misconduct increases if his new coworkers, encountered in the merger, have a history of misconduct.

However, the estimated effects of tax increase on smoking behavior vary substantially, underscoring the need to identify moderating variables. We examined whether behavioral disengagement the tendency to abandon goals when experiencing stress modified the association between cigarette taxes and daily smoking behavior. We connected state-level cigarette tax rate data with individual-level behavioral data, including a national sample of 725 US adults who smoked daily at baseline and reported follow-up data approximately 10 years later, and 376 who were resampled a third time after another 10 years. Analyses involved multilevel logistic regression (with time as a nested variable and anonymized state codes as a grouping variable), where current smoking status (dichotomous) was regressed on behavioral disengagement, state level cigarette tax at baseline and current time, and the interaction between disengagement and current tax. Consistent with hypotheses, tax rate interacted with disengagement (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90, 0.99, p = .0255): Among those one SD above the mean for disengagement, tax rate was unassociated with quit ratio (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.85, 1.16, p = .6975). However, among those one SD below the mean, tax rate was significantly associated with higher quit ratio (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.43, p = .0163). Our data suggest the possibility that cigarette taxes may be more effective in facilitating cessation among smokers low in behavioral disengagement or when accompanied by interventions that reduce stress or maintain goal pursuit. Identifying psychological moderators of policy effectiveness holds promise for improving policy design and targeting.","[Ferrer, Rebecca A.] NCI, Basic Biobehav & Psychol Sci Branch, Behav Res Program, 9609 Med Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Orehek, Edward] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Scheier, Michael F.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [O'Connell, Mary E.] NCI, Behav Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Carnegie Mellon University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI),"Ferrer, RA (通讯作者)，NCI, Basic Biobehav & Psychol Sci Branch, Behav Res Program, 9609 Med Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ferrerra@mail.nih.gov; orehek@pitt.edu; scheier@cmu.edu; Mary.O'Connell@nih.gov,,,National Institute on Aging [P01-AG020166],National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),The MIDUS 2 research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (P01-AG020166) to conduct a longitudinal follow-up of the MIDUS 1 investigation.

Advances made by the Colombian government to achieve greater security within the country - putting an end to the long-standing armed conflict - and to promote ecotourism can help position Colombia as one of the most important bird watching destinations worldwide. This study estimates the economic benefits from bird-based tourism in post-war Colombia. In particular, we estimate the value that members of the US-based National Audubon Society place on a birding tour that includes the participation of local communities (some of whom were victims of the armed conflict), and visits to important areas for bird watching that are increasingly accessible. The study also approximates the demand for international bird watching tourism to the country. Through the application of the contingent valuation method, we show that birding enthusiasts would be willing to pay, on average, an additional $58 per person per day for a tour in Colombia, as compared to a similar tour in terms of duration and services in Costa Rica, currently one of the main tourism destinations for birdwatchers. Our analysis indicates that a total of 278,850 North American bird watchers would be interested in visiting the country, generating an annual profit of $9 million and 7516 new jobs. In addition to confirming demand for bird-based travel, the study provides information about potential visitors' preferences, which can help guide the development of a strategy to promote bird-based tourism to Colombia.

Our findings show evidence of instability in standard cointegration models, suggesting the possibility of structural breaks and nonlinearity in the relationship between house prices and non-housing CPI. This motivates the use of a time-varying approach, namely, a quantile cointegration analysis, which allows the cointegrating coefficient to vary over the conditional distribution of house prices and simultaneously test for the existence of cointegration at each quantile. Our results suggest that the U.S non-housing CPI and house price index series are cointegrated at lower quantiles only, with house prices over-hedging inflation at these quantiles. In addition, we also show that this result holds for higher price levels only. Using these two sets of results, we conclude that house prices act as an inflation hedge when the latter is relatively higher and the former is lower.","[Christou, Christina] Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Econ & Management, CY-2220 Latsia, Cyprus; [Gupta, Rangan; Nyakabawo, Wendy] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Open University of Cyprus; University of Pretoria; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",christina.christou@ouc.ac.cy; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; wnyakabawo@gmail.com; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,65,18,18,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Levered banks take excessive risk as their actions are not fully priced at the margin by debt holders. The impact of government guarantees on bank risk taking depends critically on the portion of bank investors that can observe bank behavior and hence price debt at the margin. Greater guarantees increase risk taking (moral hazard) when informed investors hold a sufficiently large fraction of liabilities. But, otherwise, they reduce risk taking by increasing the profits of the bank (franchise value effect). The results extend to the case in which information disclosure and, thus, the portion of informed investors is endogenous but costly. The model also shows that, when bank capital is endogenous, public guarantees lead unequivocally to an increase in bank leverage and an associated increase in risk taking. The analysis points to a complex relationship between prudential policy and the institutional framework governing bank resolution and bailouts.","[Cordella, Tito] World Bank, Dev Econ, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Dell'Ariccia, Giovanni] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Marquez, Robert] Univ Calif Davis, Finance, Davis, CA 95616 USA",The World Bank; International Monetary Fund; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Dell'Ariccia, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Dell'Ariccia, G (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",gdellariccia@imf.org,"Cordella, Tito/AAN-1891-2020; Marquez, Robert/C-4963-2017","Cordella, Tito/0000-0001-5520-165X",,,,,38,15,15,2,27,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households' socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods. Participants in one of the three PES projects recorded higher economic status and agricultural productivity than non-participants, suggesting that there can be important social co-benefits to conservation interventions when programs are well-designed to respond to local contexts.

This method has been increasingly applied in the energy domain to collect information on the future cost, technical performance, and associated uncertainty of specific energy technologies. This article has two main objectives: (1) to introduce the basics of expert elicitations, including their design and implementation, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and their potential to inform policymaking and energy system decisions; and (2) to discuss and compare the results of a subset of the most recent expert elicitations on energy technologies, with a focus on future cost trajectories and implied cost reduction rates. We argue that the data on future energy costs provided by expert elicitations allows for more transparent and robust analyses that incorporate technical uncertainty, which can then be used to support the design and assessment of energy and climate change mitigation policies.","[Verdolini, Elena; Bosetti, Valentina; Reis, Lara Aleluia] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena; Bosetti, Valentina; Reis, Lara Aleluia] Fdn CMCC, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Milan, Italy; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Baker, Erin] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, ELab 219, 160 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01002 USA; [Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Ettore Bocconi Dept Econ, Room 5-D1-01,Via Roentgen,1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Cambridge; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Bocconi University,"Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，Fdn CMCC, Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Milan, Italy.",elena.verdolini@feem.it; lda24@cam.ac.uk; edbaker@ecs.umass.edu; valentina.bosetti@unibocconi.it; lara.aleluia@feem.it,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930; Aleluia Reis, Lara/0000-0002-6676-7007",ERC [336703 - RISICO]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730403 - INNOPATHS],ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"The authors would like to thank the editor and the managing editor for their extensive support and three anonymous referees for excellent comments that helped to improve the article significantly.

The second contribution is empirical evidence for more than 60 bond and equity markets in line with this prediction.

Permanent or temporary out-migration can provide an individual or family the opportunity to mitigate against these effects. One major challenge to quantifying the impact of climate change on out-migration is lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data. Out-migration data must be adequately detailed to include both long- and short-term departures. The climate data must provide fine scale, community-specific detail. To examine the climate variability as a factor of out-migration we examine individual- and community-level responses using highly detailed, full migration histories of 3150 individuals with fine-scale rainfall data. Using this multi-method approach we examine the probability of out-migration as well as out-migration duration and destination as they relate to locally measured rainfall. The results suggest that out-migration behavior does not generally change because of failures or variation in the rainy season. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to 2009, all recorded (roll call) votes in the European Parliament had to be requested explicitly by European Political Groups. Since 2009, a roll call vote has been mandatory on all final legislative votes. We exploit that change in the rules and compare differences between final legislative votes, amendment votes and non-legislative votes before and after 2009, using a difference-in-differences approach with extensive controls. Using data from the Sixth (2004-2009) to Seventh (2009-2014) European Parliaments, we fail to find any large differences in voting cohesion for the main political groups. We find even less significance when we control for changes in parliamentary membership between those two periods. The results suggest that selection biases in the European Parliament associated with strategic choices are negligible.","[Hix, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Noury, Abdul] New York Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Roland, Gerard] Univ Calif Berkeley, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Roland, Gerard] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Noury, A (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",S.Hix@lse.ac.uk; agn2@nyu.edu; groland@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Hix, Simon/0000-0002-3116-5292",,,,,42,16,19,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,211,228,,10.1007/s11127-018-0529-1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438459400012,0

We measure tournament incentives using the pay gap between a CEO and the next layer of senior executives. We find that tournament incentives are positively related to innovative efficiency, as measured by the number of patents and patent citations generated per million dollars of R&D expense. Our main finding holds in an instrumental-variable analysis and regressions using alternative innovation measures, including patent generality and originality indices and stock market reactions to patent grants. Consistent with prior theories, the positive effect of tournament incentives is found to be particularly pronounced during the period prior to CEO turnovers.","[Shen, Carl Hsin-han] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Zhang, Hao] Rochester Inst Technol, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Zhang, Hao] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Washington, DC USA",National Central University; Rochester Institute of Technology; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Shen, CHH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,"Shen, Carl Hsin-han/0000-0003-1982-6673",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan; Saunders College of Business at RIT,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Saunders College of Business at RIT","We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers and Vikrant Vig (the editor) for their constructive and valuable comments.

Since the 1990s, however, many metropolitan areas have seen a resurgence of interest in central city neighborhoods. Theoretical models of income sorting lead to ambiguous predictions about where households of different income levels will live within metropolitan areas. In this paper, we explore infra-city spatial patterns of income and race for U.S. metropolitan areas, focusing particularly on the locations of low-income and minority neighborhoods. Results indicate that, on average, neighborhood income increases with distance to city centers for blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Income among non-Hispanic whites is uncorrelated with distance to CBD.

Vision screening is common in U.S. schools, but it remains an open question whether screening alone is sufficient to improve student outcomes. We implemented a multi-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of vision screening, and of vision screening accompanied by eye exams and eyeglasses, provided by a non-profit organization to Title I elementary schools in three large central Florida school districts. We find that providing additional/enhanced screening alone is generally insufficient to improve student achievement in math and reading. In contrast, providing screening along with free eye exams and free eyeglasses to students with vision problems improved student achievement as measured by standardized test scores. We find, averaging over all students (including those without vision problems), that this more comprehensive intervention increased the probability of passing the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Tests (FCATs) in reading and math by approximately 2.0 percentage points. We also present evidence that indicates that this impact fades out over time, indicating that follow-up actions after the intervention may be necessary to sustain these estimated achievement gains.","[Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 332G Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [West, Kristine L.] St Catherine Univ, Dept Econ, Whitby 106C,2004 Randolph Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Lee, Jongwook] Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Saint Catherine University,"Glewwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 332G Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",pglewwe@umn.edu; klwest@stkate.edu; leex2825@umn.edu,,"Lee, Jongwook/0000-0002-3660-4370",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041023] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,29,33,35,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

If rationality can be characterized by conditions on preferences and choices and, in addition, people are, to a reasonable degree of approximation rational, then economists can invoke the theory of rationality to explain choices. If people are also, as in positive economics, largely self-interested and reasonably well-informed, then their preferences will also indicate their level of well-being. Modeling both choice and welfare in terms of rational preferences thus unites positive and normative economics. In explaining market outcomes in terms of individual choices, explaining choices by preferences, and taking preferences to indicate well-being, economists who are concerned with welfare defend a normative theory that piggybacks on their positive theory. This traditional mainstream normative theory is problematic, but because of its unity and its connection to positive economics, it is also very powerful.","[Hausman, Daniel M.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hausman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dhausman@wisc.edu,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

When these factors are associated with small betas, the beta-estimator using their mimicking portfolios has nonstandard limit behavior. This jeopardizes inference on risk premia in the commonly used Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass procedure. Using sorting or the average excess returns on the mimicking portfolios to estimate the risk premia leads to similar non-standard behavior. We therefore propose a novel test for the risk premia on mimicking portfolios. Its validity does not depend on the magnitude of the betas. Simulation evidence suggests that it performs well in terms of size and power. We use it to analyze the risk premium on the leverage factor of Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014). Our results indicate that the leverage factor is a weak factor which leads to substantially different results for its risk premium.","[Kleibergen, Frank] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA USA",University of Amsterdam; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Kleibergen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.r.kleibergen@uva.nl,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

We conduct a randomized trial of two financial literacy education programs in government-run Ghanaian primary and junior high schools.

Our study finds that after nine months, both programs had positive impacts on self-reported savings at school relative to the control group, but there were no statistically significant increases in aggregate savings nor in hypothesized mechanisms such as attitudes, preferences, or knowledge. The financial education-only treatment led to a weakly statistically significant increase in child labor relative to the control group, although the difference in impact between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. The lack of short-term effects of these programs on financial behaviors and attitudes indicate that alternative program designs should be evaluated to understand whether and how these outcomes can be influenced among students in this age group.

Constraining forestland to its current boundaries and constraining management to current levels reduce average sequestration by 25 to 28 Tg C y(-1).

Evidence from India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Climate change; Agriculture; India; Crop choice,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; MIGRATION RESPONSE; IMPACTS; AGRICULTURE; YIELDS; HEAT; VULNERABILITY; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY; IRRIGATION,"Projections suggest that the damages from climate change will be substantial for developing countries. Understanding the ability of households in these countries to adapt to climate change is critical in order to determine the magnitude of the potential damages. In this paper, I investigate the ability of farmers in India to adapt to higher temperatures. I use a methodology that exploits short-term weather fluctuations as well as spatial variation in long-run climate. Specifically, I estimate how damaging high temperatures are for districts that experience high temperatures more or less frequently. I find that the losses from high temperatures are lower in heat-prone districts, a result that is consistent with adaptation. However, while adaptation appears to be modestly effective for moderate levels of heat, my results suggest that adaptation to extreme heat is much more difficult. Extremely high temperatures do grave damage to crops, even in places that experience these temperature extremes regularly. The persistence of negative impacts of high temperatures, even in areas that experience high temperatures frequently, underscores the need for development policies that emphasize risk mitigation and explicitly account for climate change-related risks.

We draw upon data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) on new long term care insurance (LTCI) purchases (traditional and Partnership) by US state (weighted by the population over age 65 to make the data comparable). We use a difference-in-differences strategy to obtain estimates of the program effect of the LTCP on the overall uptake of private LTCI, and specifically of LTCP contracts and applications for a subsample of states. Findings suggest no significant effect of LTCP on insurance uptake and an increase in insurance applications.

Using a panel of Ohio school districts that adopted a local income tax from 1990 to 2008, we find that revenues are procyclical and fluctuate only mildly. The estimated short- and long-run income elasticity of school district income tax revenues is 1.05 and 1.04, respectively. We also find that the school district tax base fully adjusts to its long-run equilibrium within 2 years.

Previous work has shown that these mandates likely increase health insurance premiums, which in turn could make it more costly for firms to compensate employees. Using 1996-2010 data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and a novel instrumental variables strategy, we show that there is limited evidence that mandates reduce employment. However, we find that mandates lead to a distortion in firm size, benefiting larger firms that are able to self-insure and thus exempt themselves from these state-level health insurance regulations. This distortion in firm size away from small businesses may lead to substantial decreases in productivity and economic growth.","[Bailey, James] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Webber, Douglas] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Creighton University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Bailey, J (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",jamesbailey@creighton.edu,"Bailey, James/AAE-7321-2019","Bailey, James/0000-0002-6132-6026",Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,We thank the Mercatus Center at George Mason University for funding and helpful comments.,,32,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Interaction effects with mineral oil taxes reduce carbon taxes on motor fuels and transport externalities increase them. We show that the cost-effective overall carbon tax on motor fuels should be lower than the one on thermal fuels. This is found in spite of the fact that pre-existing taxes on motor fuels are well below our estimate of the transport externality per unit of transport fuel consumption. Differentiating taxes in favor of motor fuels yields only slightly more equitable incidence effects among households, suggesting that equity considerations play a minor role when designing differentiated carbon pricing policies.","[Landis, Florian; Rausch, Sebastian; Kosch, Mirjam] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Rausch, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Rausch, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",landisf@ethz.ch; srausch@ethz.ch; mkosch@ethz.ch,,"Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406","Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST); Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); SNF [407140_153710]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [407140_153710] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST); Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); SNF; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research, Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER-CREST) and the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).

We analyze transition paths as well as steady state responses to the new policies. The current reforms in China provide modest rural pensions and reimbursement of a portion of healthcare costs, but at rates that are substantially lower than are already in place in the urban sector. We investigate the potential effect of raising the rural benefit rates to those enjoyed in the urban sector. While both reforms reduce income per capita, we show that the health insurance reforms are potentially welfare improving if they are implemented in a way that leads to reduced out-of-pocket health spending. The welfare gains are driven by rural health insurance providing relief from the risk of catastrophic medical expenditures that can wipe out household savings and force long working hours. A pay-as-you-go rural pension results in a welfare gain in the short-run but welfare loss in the long-run due to the distorting effects of taxes. Despite an increase in required financing due to an aging population, the welfare impact of rural health insurance remains positive when incorporating the projected old-age dependency ratio for the year 2050. However, a pay-as-you-go rural pension creates large income and welfare losses with 2050 demographics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Simply increasing public expenditure in the health sector, however, may not significantly affect health outcomes if the efficiency of this spending is low.

The results suggest that African economies have the lowest efficiency. At 2009 spending levels, they could boost life expectancy up to about 5 years if they followed best practices.","[Grigoli, Francesco; Kapsoli, Javier] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Grigoli, F (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",fgrigoli@imf.org,,,,,,,25,26,28,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs.

We construct a new database of studies of these programs that report impacts on food security outcomes and asset formation. Our meta-analysis finds that social protection programs improve both the quantity and quality of food consumed by beneficiaries. The magnitudes of these effect sizes are meaningful. The average social protection program increases the value of food consumed/expenditure by 13% and caloric acquisition by 8%. Food expenditure rises faster than caloric acquisition because households use transfers to improve the quality of their diet, most notably increasing their consumption of calories from animal source foods. Since the consumption of animal source foods in these populations is low, and because there are significant nutritional benefits to increasing the consumption of these, this is a positive outcome. Our meta-analysis also finds that social protection programs lead to increased asset holdings as measured by livestock, non-farm productive assets, farm productive assets, and savings. There is no impact on land holdings though the number of studies that assess these is small. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

We answer these questions in a model with time-varying risk, modeled as a small and variable probability of an economic disaster. A high probability implies greater risk and lower future growth, lowering the incentives of firms to invest in hiring. During periods of high risk, stock market valuations are low and unemployment rises.

However, little is known about the actual underlying risk to the fiscal sector just after such events. In this paper, we estimate the risk of fiscal shortages due to tropical storms in the Caribbean. To this end, first we use a panel VAR and estimate that while government expenditure does not respond to damages due to tropical storms, there is a significant contemporaneous effect on fiscal revenue. The results also reveal that different components of expenditure and revenue respond differently to hurricane shocks. Then, employing a parametric bulk extreme value model on estimated losses due to historical events, we show that the fiscal shortage due to storms can potentially be sizeable depending on the rarity of the event, but varies considerably across islands. However, any risk assessment is fraught with considerable uncertainty, particularly for rare but potentially very damaging tropical storm strikes.","[Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Strobl, Eric] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Vermeiren, Jan] Kinet Anal Corp, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Yearwood, Stacia] Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facil, St Michael, Barbados",University of Manchester; University of Bern,"Ouattara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",osman.ouattara-2@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper fills that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies their impact on debtors. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from an institution primarily concerned with preserving creditors' claims into an instrument to foster development in the world's poorer nations, among other objectives. Our study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with an acceleration of per capita GDP growth and with a reduction in poverty and inequality.

In equilibrium, financial constraints do not affect the identity of the winning bidder, but they lower bidders' incentives to approach the target. Auctions are initiated by bidders with low constraints or high synergies. The use of cash is positively related to synergies and the acquirer's gains from the deal and negatively to financial constraints.","[Gorbenko, Alexander S.] USC Marshall Sch Business, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy,Ste 308, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Malenko, Andrey] MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Gorbenko, AS (通讯作者)，USC Marshall Sch Business, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy,Ste 308, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",gorbenko@marshall.usc.edu,,,,,,,51,30,31,2,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

What factors shape the effectiveness of policy implementation following reform decisions? These questions increasingly concern the international donor and research communities, given the importance of policy environments in shaping development outcomes and the growing need to achieve development impact with scarce resources. To address these questions, this paper introduces the Kaleidoscope Model of policy change. Inductively derived from empirical examples in developing countries, political economy literature, and theoretical scholarship on the policy process, the model proposes a set of 16 operational hypotheses to identify the conditions under which policies emerge on the agenda and ultimately are implemented. The paper tests the model empirically in Zambia by evaluating eight policy reform episodes related to agricultural input subsidies and vitamin A fortification. Empirical application and hypothesis testing rely on rigorous process tracing using secondary sources and semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 58 stakeholders in Zambia. In the policy reforms studied, a majority of the KM's core variables proved robust across the two distinct policy domains, while a handful emerged as relevant only episodically. In an era of growing pressure on donor resources and government budgets, the Kaleidoscope Model offers a practical framework through which practitioners and researchers can assess when and where investments in policy reforms are most feasible given a country's underlying political, economic, and institutional characteristics.

The empirical analysis indicates that the pass-through of cigarette taxes to the final consumer price is fast but incomplete in Pakistan. The pass-through coefficient is estimated to be in the range of 70 to over 90 percent across four major cigarette brands, and most of the pass-through occurs contemporaneously within a period of 2 months. The results imply that a 1-Pakistan rupee (PR) increase in taxation leads to an increase of PRs 0.8, on average, in cigarette prices. In other words, cigarette taxes are under-shifted to consumers in Pakistan. With respect to the tax pass-through at different price tiers (budget, mainstream, and premium), I find significant variation in the pass-through coefficient, which is close to one for the premium cigarette brand and significantly lower for the budget and mainstream cigarette brands.","[Cevik, Serhan] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20436 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Cevik, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20436 USA.",scevik@imf.org,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

There is already a well-established body of literature in public finance, which argues that intergovernmental grants crowd out local revenues. Most existing studies, however, explore the fiscal implications of intergovernmental transfers in high-income countries where sound fiscal systems are taken for granted. In this paper, I explore the impact of intergovernmental transfers on local revenues in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where local fiscal capacity is limited and endogenously determined by financial support from international donors and the central government. I argue that in places where the existing capacity of LGAs to administer tax collection is weak and political costs of enforcing taxation are low-which are perennial features of many rural districts in Africa-intergovernmental transfers facilitate local revenue generation instead of undermining it. Analyzing newly available quarterly fiscal data on local revenues in Tanzania, I show that intergovernmental grants improve the mobilization of local revenues, and also that the positive effect of fiscal transfers on local revenue collection seems to be more pronounced in rural districts.

Our analysis of insurer sorting reveals that lower-risk drivers on attributes observed by insurers obtain coverage from insurers with higher-quality ratings.","[Robinson, Patricia A.; Sloan, Frank A.; Eldred, Lindsey M.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Sloan, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",fsloan@duke.edu,,,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA017913-01A1],National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),"This article was funded in part by a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA, #R01AA017913-01A1).

A correlated random effects (CRE) device is used, and consistency and robustness of results are checked using various other estimation models. The receipt of fertilizer and seed subsidies is shown to have an inconsistent impact on farm productivity and food security; at the same time, access to agricultural advice is consistently insignificant in explaining these. Further analysis, however, shows a statistically significant and strong association with farm productivity and food security when access to extension services is unpacked to include indicators of usefulness and farmers' satisfaction. Households that reported receipt of very useful agricultural advice had greater productivity and greater food security compared to those that reported receipt of advice that they considered not useful and those that did not receive any advice at all. This result implies the need to ensure the provision of relevant and useful agricultural advice to increase the likelihood of achieving agricultural development outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using panel data from Indonesia we find that more than half of working age adults in our sample experience a physical disability at least once in four waves over 16 years. Changes in physical functioning have no effect on hours worked among the employed. However, onsets of physical limitations lead to an increase in the probability of leaving employment, while recoveries increase the probability of returning to work. A larger effect is found among self-employed workers compared to salaried workers. Given the rising prevalence of physical limitations with age, physical disability may be a significant barrier to employment for older working age adults in Indonesia. These results overall point towards a need in Indonesia for policies that support maintaining work or returning to work for persons with physical disability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the United States, easements represent the largest charitable gift on a per-donation basis, but skeptics wonder if their tax preference merely subsidizes wealthy landowners rather than inducing conservation. We incorporate federal and state income tax codes into a calculator to quantify the after-tax donation price and demonstrate its sensitivity to landowner income and state and federal policies. Using a 1987-2012 panel, we measure the response of state-level easements to the price. Our large elasticity estimates, spanning -2.4 to -6.1, indicate that tax incentives induce conservation and do not merely subsidize it.

While financial resources increase access to healthcare and nutrition and reduce mortality, sickness also reduces labor force participation, thereby reducing income. Without longitudinal data, it is difficult to study the linkage between economic status and mortality. Using data from a national sample of 132,116 Indian adults aged 15 years and above, this paper examines their likelihood of death between wave 1 of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted in 2004-05 and wave 2, conducted in 2011-12. The results show that mortality between the two waves is strongly linked to the economic status of the household at wave 1 regardless of the choice of indicator for economic status. However, negative relationship between economic status and mortality for individuals already suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic conditions varies between three markers of economic status income, consumption, and ownership of consumer durables reflecting two-way relationship between short- and long-term markers of economic status and morbidity.

Other authors also use Omega for optimizing (non-linear) portfolios with important downside risk. However, we question in this article the relevance of such approaches. First, we show through a basic illustration that the Omega ratio is inconsistent with the Second-order Stochastic Dominance criterion. Furthermore, we observe that the trade-off between return and risk corresponding to the Omega measure, may be essentially influenced by the mean return. Next, we illustrate in static and dynamic frameworks that Omega-based optimal portfolios can be closely associated with classical optimization paradigms depending on the chosen threshold used in Omega. Finally, we present robustness checks on long-only asset and hedge fund databases, that confirm our results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The tests are based on the Swamy statistic. We establish the asymptotic null distribution of the tests under large panels. A prominent advantage of the proposed tests is that they are easy to implement in empirical applications. Monte Carlo experiments show evidence that the tests have good finite sample performance in terms of size and power. The tests are then applied to study the cross-section of firms' excess asset returns using financial data on U.S. firms. The tests allow us to assess, for a given quantile of the distribution of excess returns, whether the linear effect of the pricing factors in standard linear asset pricing models is the same across stocks. The results confirm the validity of those models for the mean and central quantiles. However, for tail quantiles, the slope homogeneity tests reject the null hypothesis providing empirical evidence of pricing anomalies. This suggests that the effect of firm characteristics on the distribution of excess returns is heterogeneous across stocks during booms and busts.","[Galvao, Antonio F.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Juhl, Ted] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] Univ San Andres, CONICET, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Iowa; University of Kansas; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Southampton,"Galvao, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, W284 PBB,21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",antonio-galvao@uiowa.edu,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [ECO2013-46516-C4-1-R]; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2014-1279]","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya","The authors would like to express their appreciation to Valentina Corradi, Roger Koenker, Tom Parker, Hashem Pesaran, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Kevin Sheppard, Suyong Song, and participants in seminars at UIUC, University of Iowa, and UWM, Central Bank of Brazil, and ES NASM for useful comments and discussions regarding this article.

We postulate that genetic variation can affect financial markets through its impact on aggregate investment behavior, innovation in the financial sector, and productivity. Our country-level, cross-sectional analysis reveals a significant hump-shaped relation between a country's predicted genetic variation and the size of its financial markets. This result is consistent with the conjecture that at relatively intermediate degrees of genetic variation, the associated intermediate levels of trust and risk-taking within the country result in the largest investment flows into public financial markets. Our results are robust to different measres of financial market size, several regression specifications, and the inclusion of a broad range of controls such as legal origin, institutional characteristics, culture, natural endowment, and trade openness. Our main findings appear to be restricted specifically to equity markets (vs. debt markets) where there is relatively more uncertainty and, thus, trust and risk-taking are relatively more important. Additional analysis suggests that better overall country-level governance can moderate the role that genetic variation plays in shaping equity market size.

Heterogeneity in the labour productivity of rural nonfarm businesses calls for a two-pronged strategy for rural transformation. Relatively unproductive enterprises may be part of a poverty reduction strategy but should not be expected to contribute to employment and labour productivity growth.

In particular, we use a field experiment to assess the extent to which the introduction of this ICT platform improved monitoring by the district, effort by service providers, and inputs at service points in health, education and water in Arua District, Uganda. We find suggestive evidence of a short-term improvement in some education services, but these effects deteriorate by year two of the program, and we find little or no evidence of an effect on health and water services at any period. Despite relatively high levels of system uptake, enthusiasm of district officials, and anecdotal success stories, we find that relatively few messages from citizens provided specific, actionable information about service provision within the purview and resource constraints of district officials, and users were often discouraged by officials' responses. Our findings suggest that for crowd-sourced ICT programs to move from isolated success stories to long-term accountability enhancement, the quality and specific content of reports and responses provided by users and officials is centrally important.

This assumption underlies the recovery result of Ross 2015. Following the methodology of Alvarez and Jermann 2005 and Hansen and Scheinkman 2009, we estimate the martingale component in the long-term factorization of the SDF using U.S. Treasury data. The empirically estimated martingale component is highly volatile and produces a downward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. In contrast, the transition independence assumption implies a degenerate martingale component and an upward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Thus, transition independence is inconsistent with our empirical results.","[Qin, Likuan; Linetsky, Vadim; Nie, Yutian] Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, 1245 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Linetsky, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, 1245 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",linetsky@iems.northwestern.edu,"Linetsky, Vadim/B-7474-2009",,"National Science Foundation [CMMI-1536503, DMS-1514698]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1514698] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This paper is based on research supported by grants from the National Science Foundation [CMMI-1536503 and DMS-1514698].,,31,6,7,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Where social welfare systems are insufficient, these costs may fall to other family members. We set out to estimate the association between long-term care needs and family transfers in selected low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We used data from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). Using regression, we analysed the relationship between long-term care needs in older households and i) odds of receiving net positive transfers from family outside the household and ii) the amount of transfer received, controlling for relevant socio-demographic characteristics. Results: The proportion of household members requiring long-term care was significantly associated with receiving net positive transfers in China (OR: 1.76; p = 0.023), Ghana (OR: 2.79; p = 0.073), Russia (OR: 3.50; p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant association with amount of transfer received only in Mexico (B: 541.62; p = 0.010). Conclusion: In selected LMICs, receiving family transfers is common among older households, and associated with requiring long-term care. Further research is needed to better understand drivers of observed associations and identify ways in which financial protection of older adults' long-term care needs can be improved.

The complexity of the phenomenon implies that a large set of policy instruments can be used to address child labor or can affect child labor. This review of 33 impact evaluations provides a comprehensive look at pathways through which social protection (credit and microfinance, cash transfers, vouchers, food programs), and labor programs affect child labor. Despite the complexity of integrating findings across different child labor definitions, implementation contexts, and policy instruments, some patterns emerge. For example, programs that address child labor by reducing the vulnerability of the household produce the desired effect. Transfers reduced child labor in most cases. Similarly, programs that help the household cope with exposure to risk, for example, health insurance, reduce household reliance on child labor. On the other hand, policies aimed at increasing adult household members' participation in the labor market or entrepreneurial activities, can generate demand for adolescent and child work. Of course, such programs are an important component of anti-poverty strategies, but they could be modified and integrated with additional interventions to ensure that they do not produce adverse effects on child labor. While progress has been made over the past decade, there is still much to learn about the effects of public policy on the labor participation of many children in developing countries.

Central to these debates is the question of whether and how aquaculture impacts local incomes and employment, yet little empirical evidence exists on the issue. To address this question, we propose a Local Economy-wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) model which nests fish farm models within a general-equilibrium model of their local economy. The model is calibrated using primary data collected from 1102 households in Myanmar's main aquaculture zone, representative of 60% of the country's aquaculture farms. Using this model, we examine the impact of aquaculture on the incomes and labor market outcomes of fish farming households, but also crop farms and non-farm households in the cluster. Simulating one-acre increases in pond/plot surface we find that: (1) aquaculture generates much higher incomes per-acre than agriculture; (2) aquaculture generates larger income spillovers than agriculture for non-farm households by way of retail and labor markets; (3) small commercial fish farms generate greater spillovers than large fish farms. These results bolster the notion that fish-farming, and in particular small-scale commercial aquaculture, may have a significant role to play in rural development and poverty reduction.

In our model, executives add value to the firm not only by participating in production decisions, as do other workers in the economy, but also by identifying new investment opportunities. Improvements in technology that are specific to new vintages of capital raise the return to managers' skills for discovering new growth projects and, thus, increase the compensation of executives relative to workers and disparities in pay across executives. Our model implies that, controlling for firm size, compensation is higher in fast-growing firms and that pay inequality increases as investment opportunities in the economy improve.

The effects are especially large for speculative-grade and short-maturity bonds. Overall, the policy uncertainty during the crisis and macroeconomic theories during the pre-crisis period help to explain why FOMC announcements impacted credit spreads.

Studying the evolution of coagglomeration patterns, we show that the type of agglomeration that benefits firms has drastically changed over the course of a century and differs markedly across industries. Whereas, at the beginning of the twentieth century, industries tended to colocate with their value chain partners, in more recent decades the importance of this channel has declined and colocation seems to be driven more by similarities in industries' skill requirements. By calculating industry-specific Marshallian agglomeration forces, we are able to show that, today, skill-sharing is the most salient motive behind the location choices of services, whereas value chain linkages still explain much of the colocation patterns in manufacturing. Moreover, the estimated degrees to which labor and input-output linkages are reflected in an industry's coagglomeration patterns help improve predictions of city-industry employment growth.

Fluid intelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to draw a statistical inference. Cognitive reflection helps traders avoid behavioral biases and thereby extract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. ToM describes the degree to which traders correctly assess the informational content of orders. We show that cognitive reflection and ToM are complementary because traders benefit from understanding signals' quality only if they are capable of processing these signals.","[Corgnet, Brice] GATE L SE, EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France; [Desantis, Mark; Porter, David] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; emlyon business school; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Corgnet, B (通讯作者)，GATE L SE, EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France.",,"Porter, David/R-7202-2019; Corgnet, Brice/G-7917-2017","Corgnet, Brice/0000-0003-0086-8523",LABEX CORTEX,LABEX CORTEX,"Brice Corgnet is with EMLYON Business School, GATE L-SE.

As such, several experiments have documented the degree of prudence, temperance, and, to a lesser extent, edginess and bentness that laboratory subjects exhibit. More recently, researchers have argued that higher order risk preferences generally conform to mixed risk-averse and mixed risk-loving patterns that arise from a preference for disaggregating or aggregating harms, respectively. This article examines the robustness of this pattern in three ways. First, it attempts to directly replicate previous results with compound lotteries over monetary outcomes. Second, it compares behavior in compound lotteries with behavior in reduced-form lotteries. And third, it evaluates choices over monetary and nonmonetary risks. While previous results are replicated for compound lotteries over monetary outcomes and aggregate behavior with reduced-form lotteries has a similar pattern, individuals clearly treat compound and reduced-form lotteries differently. Further, behavior differs between monetary and nonmonetary outcomes.","[Deck, Cary; Schlesinger, Harris] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Deck, Cary] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;Deck, C (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",cdeck@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,22,17,17,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Before the reform, SOE workers enjoyed similar job security as government employees. The reform caused massive SOE layoffs, but government employees kept their iron rice bowl. The changes in the relative unemployment risks for SOE workers provide a clean identification of income uncertainty. With self-selection biases mitigated by focusing on government assigned jobs, precautionary savings account for about 40 percent of SOE households' wealth accumulation. Moreover, demographic groups more vulnerable to the reform also accumulated more precautionary wealth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is less empirical research on how domestic violence impacts nutrition and food security. Two pathways described in the literature are (1) perpetrators withhold food as a form violence or control, leading to poor nutrition of women and (2) women's food preparation and portion allocation trigger retaliatory violence by perpetrators. Interviews by community researchers with over 100 women in rural Bangladesh reveal a little documented linkage between violence and food practices in rural Bangladesh. I find that women, in light of the realities and possibilities of domestic violence, weigh choices about food consumption and distribution, often choosing to eat less or lower quality foods. That is, women often demonstrate agentic decision-making in a context of violence, referred to here as burdened agency. Women traverse and navigate a complex set of relationships between hunger, undernutrition, agency and domestic violence, differing from the two presumed causal pathways. Recognizing burdened agency can explain how women make decisions around food practices, and why the uptake of certain food security and nutrition interventions may be reduced. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

While they bring developmental opportunities including capital deepening, new technology, and employment opportunities, there are also concerns about the dislocation of local farmers and insufficient compensation for land use. This paper investigates how these seemingly conflicting effects interact in the process of economic growth by fitting a dynamic general equilibrium model to Ghanaian data. The differing effects of two common foreign investment activities, grain farming and biofuel production, are investigated. Grain farming investments tend to promote capital accumulation and increase income and consumption over the transition, whereas labor income is adversely affected. Biofuel projects induce the reverse. Results identify the relative labor intensity of technology on foreign-operated farms, which affects the returns to domestic capital and the pace of capital deepening, as a major determinant of the long-term effect of farmland investments.","[Choi, Donggul] Minot State Univ, Div Social Sci, 202E Old Main,500 Univ Ave W, Minot, ND 58707 USA",,"Choi, DG (通讯作者)，Minot State Univ, Div Social Sci, 202E Old Main,500 Univ Ave W, Minot, ND 58707 USA.",choix129@umn.edu,,,,,,,26,5,5,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

These structures are characterized by different arrangements for internal rescue of affiliates against default. The cost of debt and leverage are endogenous. For moderate bailout probabilities, subsidiary structures, wherein the two entities provide mutual internal rescue under limited liability, have the highest group value, but also the highest risk taking as measured by leverage and expected loss.

We find that although an annual vehicle registration tax reduces the incentive to purchase additional vehicles among households whose sole purpose for doing so is to cheat' the restriction (i.e., the adverse scale effect'), it does so with an external cost. The cost occurs because households whose purpose for purchasing an additional vehicle is not to cheat the restriction are given the same disincentive with the tax. We show how simple one- and two-stage lotteries can be used to not only discriminate between cheater and non-cheater households (in particular, to avoid providing a disincentive to the latter type of household), but also to provide an even stronger disincentive to the former.","[Caplan, Arthur J.; Kim, Man-Keun] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,,"Kim, Man-Keun/0000-0002-0205-9618",Utah Agricultural Experiment Station [UTAO1074],Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,This research has been funded by Utah Agricultural Experiment Station grant no.

Model results show that the method of tax revenue recycling makes a difference. Either labor-tax, or capital-tax, recycling can reduce the welfare cost of a carbon tax policy relative to lump sum recycling. Of the two tax recycling options, reducing capital taxes provides the greater reduction in welfare costs. However, carbon tax revenues decline with stringent carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets and the availability of a negative-emissions technology such as bio-electricity with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). As BECCS expands, net carbon tax revenues peak and decline due to an offsetting subsidy for carbon sequestration, limiting the potential for labor- or capital-tax recycling to reduce welfare costs of a climate policy.","[Sands, Ronald D.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sands, RD (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",RSANDS@ers.usda.gov,,"Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339",,,,,6,7,8,1,31,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

The growing supply of distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from the emerging Argentinean corn-based ethanol industry is a potential feedstuff for swine producers. Using a multi-objective linear programming model, this study examined the economic and environmental concerns (i.e. cost and phosphorus content) associated with introducing DDGS in swine feed rations. Results suggest that including DDGS in swine diets concurrently minimized cost and phosphorus content. The results were extrapolated to the entire Argentinean swine industry and show that the inclusion of DDGS in swine rations could potentially save the Argentinean swine industry about 19.21 million US dollars annually and reduce phosphorus content by up to 5%. In addition, sensitivity analysis of DDGS price was conducted and the potential demand for DDGS from swine by growth category was derived.","[De Matteis, Maria C.; Yu, T.

We provide a cost based model evaluation approach for managers to analyze returns to machine learning methods relative to standard econometric approaches. While there are potentially significant returns to machine learning methods, research objectives and firm-level costs are important considerations that in some cases may favor standard econometric approaches.","[Iffy, Jennifer] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 451B Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kuhns, Ryan] Farmer Mac, 1999 K St NW,4th Floor, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Patrick, Kevin] Booz Allen, 901 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Cornell University,"Iffy, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 451B Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jifft@cornell.edu,,,,,,,28,6,6,3,23,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Used primarily in psychology, the RAI measures the extent to which an individual's actions are intrinsically or extrinsically motivated, where higher scores indicate greater autonomy. On aggregate, we find differences between men and women, and across countries, in the significance of association between the individual's level of participation in decision-making and autonomy. In addition, we find heterogeneity in the strength of this association, depending on the domain (e.g., productive versus personal decisions) and whether partners agree on who normally makes decisions. These findings imply that details related to context and measurement matter for understanding individual decision-making power. We argue that all research using information on decision-making should include a careful analysis of men's and women's perceptions of decision making within the household, which may be useful for calibrating indicators to suit specific contexts.

We found that religious marital sanctification, relationship maintenance behaviors, and social and financial support from family and friends were all related to both wives' and husbands' reports that their commitment had increased during the Recession.

We find that firms' innovative originality strongly predicts higher, more persistent, and less volatile profitability and higher abnormal stock returns, findings that are robust to extensive controls. The return predictive power of innovative originality is stronger for firms with higher valuation uncertainty, lower investor attention, and greater sensitivity of future profitability to innovative originality.

BUCHANAN; CHICAGO SCHOOL; PUBLIC CHOICE; ECONOMICS,"I present a brief history of modern public choice analysis as told through the lens of rules versus authorities, a dichotomy initially formulated by Henry C. Simons, University of Chicago professor to James M. Buchanan. Framing political decision-making as a choice between rules and authorities allows us to identify two necessary, motivating ideas for the emergence of public choice: (1) Governments are not monolithic, omniscient, social calculating machines, but are instead a collection of individuals with various and possibly competing interests. (2) Rather than empowering bureaucracies, economists and political scientists should devise rules that constrain government experts and protect democratic decision-making. Lurking behind both ideas is the legacy of Simons and his antipathy to expert management of the economy. In that antipathy, Simons makes an important contribution to the intellectual history of public choice and to Buchanan's research program.","[Johnson, Marianne] Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Johnson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",johnsonm@uwosh.edu,"Johnson, Marianne/CAF-5068-2022",,,,,,59,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,219,228,,10.1007/s11127-018-0544-2,0.0,,,10,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000433037400001,0

In this paper, we assess the current distribution of heat exposure within countries, to explore possible distributional consequences of climate change through temperature. Combining survey data from 690,745 households across 52 countries with spatial data on climate, this paper suggests that the welfare impacts of added heat stress may be regressive within countries. We find: (1) a strong negative correlation between household wealth and warmer temperature in many hot countries; (2) a strong positive correlation between household wealth and warmer temperatures in many cold countries; and (3) that poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure. While our analysis is descriptive rather than causal, our results suggest a larger vulnerability of poor people to heat extremes, and potentially significant distributional and poverty implications of climate change.","[Park, Jisung] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Bangalore, Mook; Hallegatte, Stephane] World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sandhoefner, Evan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; The World Bank; Harvard University,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Global Facil Disaster Reduct & Recovery, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Harvard Environmental Economics Program; National Science Foundation (GRFP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University; Office of the Chief Economist of the Climate Change Group; Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank Geoffrey Heal, Marianne Fay, Laura Bonzanigo, Tom Pullum, Ruilin Ren and Clara Burgert, as well as participants at the World Bank Poverty and Climate Change conference, for valuable comments and feedback.

Connected firms are less profitable in the cross-section and also experience a drop in profitability when a connected CEO comes to power.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne; Schoar, Antoinette] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne; Kramarz, Francis; Schoar, Antoinette; Thesmar, David] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Bertrand, Marianne] IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Kramarz, Francis] CREST ENSAE, Paris, France; [Schoar, Antoinette; Thesmar, David] MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA.",,,"thesmar, david/0000-0001-9265-0526",,,,,29,142,151,8,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In addition, women and married people make up a large fraction of the population and of labor market participants, total hours worked, and total earnings. For the most part, macroeconomists have been ignoring women and marriage in setting up structural models and in calibrating them using data on males only. In this paper, we ask whether ignoring gender and marriage in both models and data implies that the resulting calibration matches well the key economic aggregates. We find that it does not and we ask whether there are other calibration strategies or relatively simple models of marriage that can improve the fit of the model to aggregate data.

Post-program loan performance deteriorates faster in districts with greater program exposure, an effect that is not driven by greater risk-taking of banks.

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state-cooperative relations in which this revival takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political-economic context in Ugandaand potentially elsewhere in Africacontributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way.","[Wedig, Karin] Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA; [Wiegratz, Jorg] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Denver; University of Leeds,"Wedig, K (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA.",karin.wedig@du.edu,,"WEDIG, KARIN/0000-0001-5426-1001",,,,,127,16,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The extant literature that is at the crossroads between sources of knowledge and the experiential and intellectual base of an entrepreneur (i.e., dimensions of his/her human capital) suggests that it is through experience and through education that an entrepreneur obtains knowledge. Using information on a sample of high-tech manufacturing firms across ten European countries, we explore heterogeneities in the influence of experience, age, and education of the firm's primary founder on the perceived importance of (i.e., use of) alternative sources of knowledge. We find that the association of these characteristics differs significantly across sources of knowledge, and across European regions. Education is positively related to the importance of knowledge from research institutes and internal know-how, while age is negatively related to the importance of research institutes and positively related to publications and conferences. On the one hand, in South/East European countries, the importance of internal know-how is positively associated with age and education, but negatively associated with experience. On the other hand, the characteristics of primary founders of North/West European firms are more linked to the importance of the participation to funded research programmes. This source of knowledge is related positively with age and education and negatively with experience.","[Amoroso, Sara] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Link, Albert N.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Link, AN (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",sara.amoroso@ec.europa.eu; daudrets@indiana.edu; anlink@uncg.edu,"; Amoroso, Sara/L-7179-2014","Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Amoroso, Sara/0000-0001-5835-079X",empirical investigation of knowledge- intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral - European Commission; European Commission under Theme 8 ''Socio- Economic Sciences and Humanities'' of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,empirical investigation of knowledge- intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral - European Commission; European Commission under Theme 8 ''Socio- Economic Sciences and Humanities'' of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,"The authors wish to thank the AEGIS consortium for providing data of the AEGIS survey which supported the empirical investigation of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral, country and socioeconomic contexts.

Using an annual bank-level database for seven states between 1880 and 1910, this paper shows that after the entry of a clearinghouse member banks were less likely and nonmember banks in the same city were more likely to close. The results are driven by the fact that the presence of clearinghouses led all banks to become more exposed to systemic liquidity risk, yet provided liquidity only to member banks during panics.

A set of harmonized representative CO2 taxes and tax revenue recycling schemes is implemented in five large-scale economy-wide general equilibrium models. Recycling schemes include various combinations of uniform transfers to households and labor and capital income tax reductions. Particular focus is put on equity - the distribution of impacts across household incomes - and efficiency, evaluated in terms of household welfare. Despite important differences in the assumptions underlying the models, we find general agreement regarding the ranking of recycling schemes in terms of both efficiency and equity. All models identify a clear trade-off between efficient but regressive capital tax reductions and progressive but costly uniform transfers to households; all agree upon the inferiority of labor tax reductions in terms of welfare efficiency; and all agree that different combinations of capital tax reductions and household transfers can be used to balance efficiency and distributional concerns. A subset of the models go further and find that equity concerns, particularly regarding the impact of the tax on low income households, can be alleviated without sacrificing much of the double-dividend benefits offered by capital tax rebates. There is, however, less agreement regarding the progressivity of CO2 taxation net of revenue recycling. Regionally, the models agree that abatement and welfare impacts will vary considerably across regions of the U.S. and generally agree on their broad geographical distribution. There is, however, little agreement regarding the regions which would profit more from the various recycling schemes.","[Caron, Justin] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caron, Justin] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Cole, Jefferson; McFarland, James] US EPA, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Goettle, Richard] Northeastern Univ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Goettle, Richard] Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA; [Onda, Chikara] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Y2E2 Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Woollacott, Jared] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Northeastern University; Stanford University; Research Triangle Institute,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Caron, J (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",jcaron@mit.edu,,,Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,30,16,16,3,24,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

This article examines the history and application of the SRISK measure, which was developed at that time and is now widely used in monitoring systemic risk around the globe. The concept is explained and a variety of ways to measure SRISK are developed. In this article, new results are presented on the uncertainty associated with the SRISK measure and on how it compares with other related measures from both academics and regulators. By focusing on the mechanism by which undercapitalization of the financial sector initiates a financial crisis, new research examines how the probability of a financial crisis is affected by the level of SRISK and, consequently, how much SRISK a country can stand without having a high probability of crisis. The model used to evaluate this probability recognizes the externalities between financial institutions that make an undercapitalized firm or country more fragile if other firms and countries are also undercapitalized.","[Engle, Robert] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Volatil Inst, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Engle, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Volatil Inst, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",,,,,,,,35,23,23,3,28,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The interbank system became more resilient to solvency shocks but less resilient to liquidity shocks as banks sharply reduced their liquid assets after the Fed's founding.

Although studies have examined socioeconomic correlates of unintended fertility, the role of economic resources remains unclear. Wealth may provide an important context for whether a birth was intended or unintended. Moreover, staggering racial wealth disparities may contribute to racial/ethnic patterns of unintended childbearing. This study examines the linkages between wealth and unintended first births, drawing on data from the NLSY79 (N=1508). Results suggest that net wealth is negatively related to the probability of having an unintended first birth, controlling for a host of sociodemographic characteristics. We also use decomposition analysis to quantify wealth's contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in unintended childbearing. Second only to marital status, differences in net wealth account for 9-17% of racial/ethnic disparities in unintended childbearing. Our results suggest that wealth is a significant and heretofore overlooked correlate of unintended childbearing.","[Su, Jessica Houston] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 455 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Addo, Fenaba R.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Consumer Sci, Madison, WI USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Su, JH (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 455 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jhsu2@buffalo.edu; faddo@wisc.edu,"Su, Jessica/GLQ-8817-2022","Su, Jessica/0000-0003-3698-7807",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD047873] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,67,8,10,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

J,"Cairns, MR",,,,"Cairns, Maryann R.",,,"Metering water: Analyzing the concurrent pressures of conservation, sustainability, health impact, and equity in use",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Technopolitics; Bolivia; Human rights; Resource access; Potable water; WatSan development,WASTE-WATER; EMOTIONAL DISTRESS; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; RESOURCE RECOVERY; DRINKING-WATER; PRIVATIZATION; IRRIGATION; ATTITUDES; BOLIVIA; INFRASTRUCTURE,"This study focuses on the impacts of water and sanitation (WatSan) development with particular attention to how the technopolitical practice of water metering prompts critical discussion on the conflicting pressures of conservation, sustainability, health impact and equable access to water resources. The very act of metering is imbued with political and social expectations stemming from development organizations. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach, triangulating data from interviews, focus groups, surveys, participatory mapping, and participant observation over a period of two years. Data show that while metering regimes were designed by NGOs to ensure equal access, system sustainability and safety, and deforestation prevention (goals that community members supported), through both the meters' presence as technological constructs and due to the cost of water as gauged by the meters the practice placed undue pressure on certain groups, including large families, students, renters, and households with low incomes or seasonal income shortages. In short, water metering served to delimit true and equal access to safe water. This calls into question the utility of the ubiquitous practice and the continued proliferation of water metering in WatSan development, especially in areas that are water-rich and already have non-capitalocentric and/or locally-generated water management and conservation practices, policies, and trainings (whether formal or informal). This discussion is useful as a window into the unforeseen and hidden aspects of implementing power-laden development technologies, such as metering, and the ways in which individuals may eschew such systems in passive ways that go unchecked by monitoring and evaluation schemas. Additionally, the work critically interrogates the pairing of metering with systems that require water to remove waste from households (e.g., through flush toilets) and the appropriate design of these systems.

The main macroeconomic indicators of financialization in the USA show structural breaks that can be dated around the period of the Great Recession. The reliance of households on the formal financial system appears to have weakened for the first time since the early 1980s. The financial sector has lacked the dynamism of the previous three decades, becoming more reliant on government. The state has increased its own indebtedness and supported large financial institutions via unconventional monetary policy measures. At the same time, state intervention has tightened the regulatory framework for big banks. The future path of financialization in the USA will depend heavily on government policy with regard to state debt and financial regulation, although the scope for boosting financialization is narrow.","[Lapavitsas, Costas] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Mendieta-Munoz, Ivan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Lapavitsas, C (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Off 269,Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",cl5@soas.ac.uk,"Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/AAC-5221-2020","Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/0000-0003-0018-5642",,,,,43,7,8,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The model further predicts that segments inside a conglomerate should become more related over time, which is consistent with the data.

We find that bank loans of firms with a greater proportion of independent directors for whom the board is among their most prestigious have lower spreads, longer maturities, fewer covenants, lower syndicate concentration, lower likelihood of collateral requirement, lower annual loan fees, and higher bond ratings.

Adolescents with poor PEWB reported more symptoms of depression and ADHD, also after adjusting for covariates, including income-to-needs.

We use these two regional datasets to examine the changing travel behavior among Millennials and to put these changes in context by comparing them with changes among other social groups of interest: women and minorities. We find that the travel behavior of young people did not change substantially between 2000 and 2012. Where there are changes, these pale in comparison to the changes among women and black residents. And finally, we find that the built environment factors appear to influence travel more in 2012 than in 2000.

The results are stronger for firms with more complex tax haven structures and weakly governed firms. Furthermore, firms that respond to TIEAs by haven hopping (i.e., they move subsidiaries from affected to nonaffected tax havens) do not experience an increase in firm value.

When levying an optimal direct tax on energy or carbon use is not feasible, the analysis shows that exactly the same adjustments in resource allocation can be generated by the combination of a land tax, a housing tax, and a commuting tax. We then analyze the effects of these taxes on urban spatial structure, showing that they reduce the extent of commuting and the level of housing consumption while increasing building heights, generating a more-compact city with a lower level of emissions per capita.","[Borck, Rainald] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of Potsdam; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Borck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany.",rainald.borck@uni-potsdam.de; jkbrueck@uci.edu,"Borck, Rainald/M-3077-2019","Borck, Rainald/0000-0003-0833-020X",,,,,37,36,38,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We conclude by examining the importance of moderate nonlinearity in the context of the investment-specific technology shock models of Papanikolaou (2011) and Kogan and Papanikolaou (2014).","[Brandt, Michael W.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Chapman, David A.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Duke University; University of Virginia,"Brandt, MW (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,43,2,3,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

His thoughts were back to the challenges that his father had faced, including the investments on an integrated production system that contributed to the family's business growth. The production of cattle, sugarcane, and corn are all part of this integration system that has helped the Campanelli family to develop a successful business model. Currently, AgroPastoril Campanelli has three main production activities: beef, sugarcane, and corn. With these activities, a sustainable circle was created to guarantee more efficiency in economic, environmental and social terms. As Victor Campanelli says, 'there is a perfect synergy between sugarcane, moisture, corn, and cattle. Not just because of the better land and labor use, but also because of the inputs economy and the productivity improvement, both in agriculture and livestock'. However, the present time requires a new investment cycle, leading the whole family to consider new market opportunities, especially regarding farmer's new demands. What should we do and where should we invest? Should we improve efficiency or open new areas? Should we invest in new agriculture enterprises or start new business outside agricultural market? Those and other crucial questions were posed by Victor Campanelli thinking on potential growth strategies for AgroPastoril Campanelli.","[Scare, Roberto Fava; Farinha, Rodrigo Lourenco; Neves, Marcos Fava] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto FEA, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14020590 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Gray, Allan Wayne; Fullerton, Erin Chelsea] Univ Purdue, Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Farinha, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto FEA, Av Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14020590 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",rlfarinha@usp.br,"Neves, Marcos/J-8190-2012","Neves, Marcos/0000-0002-5693-7543",,,,,7,2,2,0,14,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Drawing on the more recent history and applying a range of methods, the papers in this special issue confirm the view that growth in agriculture is on average more poverty reducing than an equivalent amount of growth outside agriculture. They also add important nuances to this broad empirical regularity, uncover a series of structural conditions that affect this relation, and show that different mechanisms to finance public investment to boost sectoral growth (deficit financing, taxation or aid) can have widely different impacts on poverty, a widely-ignored issue so far. They do so by going beyond the traditional agriculture-nonagriculture dichotomy, also looking at the subsectors and the differential effects of prices versus productivity. They further distinguish between production for home and market consumption, between modern, outward oriented and informal domestically - focused firms, as well as between secondary towns and cities. Eight key insights emerge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, an analysis of 490 U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by 53 emerging market sovereigns during 1990-2015 reveals that after the financial crisis of 2008, launch spreads of sovereign bonds issued under U.K. law have been higher than those issued under U.S. law, by 130 basis points for BB + bonds and 175 basis points for B - bonds. This effect was not significant for investment grade bonds. On average, bonds issued under U.K. law had weaker ratings and shorter tenors post-crisis. The post-crisis impact of governing law on sovereign bond spreads is not explained by collective action clauses, or first-time bond issuances. Instead, the difference seems to be related to the perception that U.S. law offers stronger investor protection, and that the investor base for bonds issued under U.S. law is larger than that for bonds issued under U.K. law. The difference in spreads persists in the secondary market even after 180 days, perhaps because of the lack of liquidity, as investors tend to buy and hold these more attractive bonds on a longer-term basis.","[Ratha, Dilip; De, Supriyo; Kurlat, Sergio] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"De, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sde@worldbank.org,"De, Supriyo/Y-2492-2019; Ratha, Dilip/AAY-6419-2021","De, Supriyo/0000-0002-2075-7655; De, Supriyo/0000-0002-1260-2207",Research Support Budget of the World Bank [P161148],Research Support Budget of the World Bank,"Views expressed in this paper are the authors' own, and not those of the World Bank Group.

However, if a targeted intervention changes a household's utility maximization problem or influences decision-making, households might respond to the intervention in unintended ways with the potential to affect the wellbeing of non targeted members. Using panel data from a randomized controlled nutrition trial in Ghana, we evaluate household behavioral responses to the provision of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) to mothers and their infants to prevent undernutrition. We find that targeted supplementation with SQ-LNS had a positive effect on household expenditures on food, including some nutrient-rich food groups, as well as on non-food goods and services. We also find a positive impact on labor income, particularly among fathers. We then explore intrahousehold spillover effects on the nutritional status of non targeted young children in the household. We find evidence that the targeted provision of SQ-LNS led to higher height-for-age z-scores among non-targeted children in the LNS group compared to the non-LNS group, though only among those with relatively taller mothers, which is an indicator of a child's growth potential. These findings support existing evidence and suggest that unintended behavioral responses and spillover are a real possibility in the context of nutrition interventions targeting nutritionally vulnerable household members. Thoughtfully considering this possibility in the design, analyses, and evaluation of targeted nutrition interventions may provide a more complete picture of overall effects. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Access for all demands both affordability and cost recovery, and utilities (and donors) increasingly require users to shoulder the greater burden of cost recovery. We argue that the electricity system is underpinned by a set of relationships among user, provider and the service itself: these relationships are mediated by the meter, the technology of commodification. Using a constant-comparison approach, and based on a year of interviews and document analysis, we compare postpaid and prepaid meter regimes in Unguja, Tanzania. We ask: what difference does the mode of payment make to the (residential) user, the utility, and to the prospects for meeting SDG 77 We find that the prepaid meter becomes reified with its automated monitoring and measurement mechanism, rendering the once-familiar meter reader obsolete, and shutting off the flow of electricity as soon as the customer's units have run down. Reification makes the utility more invisible to the customer, who now blames the meter rather than the utility for poor service or high bills. Our interviews reveal broad support for the prepaid meter, however, because economically vulnerable users expressed greater fear of debt than of the dark, and were willing to cede control of their consumption to the new meter. These findings undermine the common accusation of a culture of nonpayment in Africa. We also find that prepaid meters may incentivize the partial return to biomass-based fuels when cash is not available exactly the behavior that universal access to electricity is supposed to prevent. We conclude that, if access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa becomes entirely contingent on payment prior to use, this is not fully compatible with a commitment to universal basic access.

Motivated by a simple model, demand shocks are identified as returns to an index of oil producing firms which are orthogonal to unexpected changes in the VIX index, with supply shocks capturing the remaining variation in oil prices. Demand shocks are strongly positively correlated with market returns and economic output, whereas supply shocks have a strong negative correlation. The negative correlation of supply shocks and returns is strongest in industries that produce consumer goods, while the positive correlation of demand shocks is stronger for industries which use relatively large amounts of oil as an input.","[Ready, Robert C.] Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Ready, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",,,,,,,,25,180,183,12,97,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We construct an econometric model that matches fraud alert data from the European Union (EU) Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) from 2006 to 2016 with annual data on bilateral trade flows. We find that-prior to the horsemeat scandal-detection of fraud along the supply chain induced a small amount of trade diversion toward third-country sources, but did not substantially affect total trade into the EU. In contrast, in the years after the scandal, the detection of fraud by international suppliers was substantially trade destructive. Detection of fraud reduced trade, not only with the country from which the fraudulent product originated, but also from third-country exporters of the same product. These findings extend beyond trade in meat products and to importing countries outside Western and Northern Europe.","[Schaefer, K.

We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity.","[Bhalla, Garima] Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Seidenfeld, David] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW 200, Washington, DC 20007 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; American Institutes for Research,"Bhalla, G (通讯作者)，Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England.",garims@gmail.com,,,UNICEF [431-23421],UNICEF,This work was supported by UNICEF [431-23421].,,32,40,43,4,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,82,99,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.007,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,31692975.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000426412400008,0

After ISPs were phased out during the 1980s and 1990s, the landscape has changed profoundly since the early 2000s. By 2010, at least 10 African governments initiated a new wave of subsidy programs that were designed to overcome past performance challenges. This study provides the most comprehensive review of recent evidence to date regarding the performance of these second generation ISPs, synthesizing nearly 80 ISP-related studies from seven countries (Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, and Ethiopia). We specifically evaluate ISP impacts on total fertilizer use, food production, commercial input distribution systems, food prices, wages, and poverty. We also consider measures that could enable ISPs to more cost-effectively achieve their objectives. We find that ISPs can quickly raise national food production, and that receiving subsidized inputs raises beneficiary households' grain yields and production levels at least in the short-term. However, the overall production and welfare effects of subsidy programs tend to be smaller than expected. Two characteristics of program implementation consistently mitigate the intended effects of ISPs: (1) subsidy programs partially crowd out commercial fertilizer demand due to difficulties associated with targeting and sale of inputs by program implementers, and (2) lower than expected crop yield response to fertilizer on smallholder managed fields. If these challenges could be addressed, ISPs could more effectively mitigate the concurrent challenges of rapid population growth and climate change in SSA.","[Jayne, Thomas S.; Mason, Nicole M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Rm 202, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Burke, William J.] Agr & Food Policy Consulting, 3016 St Paul St,3rd Floor, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Ariga, Joshua] Int Fertilizer Dev Ctr, Reservat Rd,Complex F, Muscle Shoals, AL 35662 USA",Michigan State University,"Burke, WJ (通讯作者)，Agr & Food Policy Consulting, 3016 St Paul St,3rd Floor, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jayne@msu.eud; mason@msu.edu; burkewj2@gmail.com; jariga@ifdc.org,"Burke, William J/AAI-9265-2020","Burke, William J/0000-0003-4961-2211","World Bank; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant [OPP1039151]; US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab [AID-OAA-L-13-00001]; USAID Missions [611-A-00-11-00001-00, AID-623-A-12-00022]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1039151] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",World Bank(The World Bank India); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant; US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID Missions(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This work was supported by the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant (OPP1039151), the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab [AID-OAA-L-13-00001], and the USAID Missions to Zambia [grant number 611-A-00-11-00001-00] and Kenya [grant number AID-623-A-12-00022].

One reason why is that attaining substantial yield advantages has been difficult in this harsh, heterogeneous growing environment. Release in Mali of the first sorghum hybrids in Sub-Saharan Africa that have been developed primarily from local germplasm has the potential to change this situation. Utilizing plot data collected in Mali, we explain the adoption of improved seed with an ordered logit model and apply a multivalued treatment effects model to measure impacts on farm families, differentiating between improved varieties and hybrids. Since farm families both consume and sell their sorghum, we consider effects on consumption patterns as well as productivity. Status within the household, conferred by gender combined with marital status, generation, and education, is strongly related to the improvement status of sorghum seed planted in these extended family households. Effects of hybrid use on yields are large, widening the range of food items consumed, reducing the share of sorghum in food purchases, and contributing to a greater share of the sorghum harvest sold. Use of improved seed appears to be associated with a shift toward consumption of other cereals, and also to greater sales shares. Findings support on-farm research concerning yield advantages, also suggesting that the use of well-adapted sorghum hybrids could contribute to diet diversification and the crop's commercialization by smallholders.","[Smale, Melinda; Assima, Amidou; Theriault, Veronique] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kergna, Alpha] Inst Econ Rural, Econ Filiere, Bamako, Mali; [Weltzien, Eva] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, Madison, WI USA",Michigan State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu; amidou.assima@gmail.com; akergna@yahoo.fr; theria13@msu.edu; e.weltzien@icrisatml.org,,,Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA); USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy [AID-OAA-L-13-00001],Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA); USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This study was funded Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA) and USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy (Contract AID-OAA-L-13-00001).,,29,43,44,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,162,171,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.001,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,29479132.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000426412400016,0

However, global food systems are not delivering diverse and high quality diets: healthy food is unavailable and too expensive for many. Creating food environments that foster consumer access to fruit and vegetables will require coordinated policy action across sectors, mostly outside of the health sector. The aim of this paper is to identify opportunities to strengthen food system policy for nutrition, through an analysis of the policies relevant to the external food environment for fruit and vegetables in India. We conducted interviews based on policy theory with 55 stakeholders from national and state level, from within government, research, private sector and non-government agencies, and from health, agriculture and economic sectors. Specific strategies identified in this study to improve consumers' external food environment for fruit and vegetables in India were: development of strategic Public-Private Partnerships to increase access to diverse expertise across the supply chain; linking health and economic/agricultural policy agendas; and strengthening surveillance of policy impacts on consumer access to fruit and vegetables. We also found that public health actors can play an important role in advocating for 'consumer oriented' fruit and vegetable supply policy. This study demonstrates the usefulness of 'policy learning'-oriented qualitative policy analysis in identifying 'points of entry' for food policy change, and extends understanding of political dynamics in engendering agricultural policy change for nutrition. Improving access to affordable fruit and vegetables is a global priority, and given common global food supply challenges, the findings from this study are also likely to be relevant for other low and middle income countries.","[Thow, Anne Marie] Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verma, Garima; Soni, Deepa; Soni, Divya; Beri, Deepti Kumar; Kumar, Poorvaja; Khandelwal, Shweta] Publ Hlth Fdn India, New Delhi, India; [Siegel, Karen R.; Shaikh, Nida] Emory Univ, Nutr & Hlth Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Siegel, Karen R.] Emory Univ, Dept Global Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Shaikh, Nida] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",University of Sydney; Public Health Foundation of India; Emory University; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Fogarty International Center (FIC),"Thow, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Level 2,Charles Perkins Ctr D17, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Khandelwal, S (通讯作者)，Publ Hlth Fdn India, ISID Campus,4 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",annemarie.thow@sydney.edu.au,"Thow, Anne Marie/JCE-5108-2023; soni, Divya/IAQ-5582-2023","soni, Divya/0000-0003-0000-010X; Beri, Deepti/0000-0002-4748-0334; Soni, Deepa/0000-0002-5312-5304",UK aid from the UK government,UK aid from the UK government(CGIAR),"We gratefully acknowledge the participation of the interviewees, and the constructive comments by the anonymous reviewers.

Most of the ideas proposed to this point involve either behavioral nudges or administrative regulations that are either too paternalistic or piecemeal to represent viable solutions. In this study, we investigate the potential for commercial peer-to-peer mutualization systems (CPMSs), or sharing-economy firms, to emerge as market platforms for the exchange of surplus food. If a system of CPMSs is able to develop in a self-sustaining way, then the market prices they create will generate sufficient incentives for all actors to manage surplus food more efficiently. We develop an empirical model of a CPMS operating as a platform in a two-sided market, and examine its viability using data from one of the first CPMS firms in the surplus-harvest industry, Imperfect Produce, Inc. Empirical estimates of a two-sided network demand model show that user-demand rises in the number of growers shipping to the platform, and grower demand for distribution rises in the number of users. Our findings indicate that secondary markets have the key elements needed for CPMS success, and that policy tools designed to facilitate transactions in secondary markets can be highly effective in reducing food waste.","[Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Hamilton, Stephen F.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Econ Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Richards, TJ (通讯作者)，7231 E,Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",trichards@asu.edu,"An, Hongda/GNH-4090-2022","Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA) [2016-09900]","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA)","Funding from Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA) Grant No. 2016-09900 is gratefully acknowledged.",,72,43,54,4,54,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,FEB,2018,75.0,,,,,,109,123,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.008,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GD8NQ,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430769600009,0

However, widespread adoption of recycled water by agriculture will depend on consumers' acceptance of food crops grown with this water. In a revealed-preference dichotomous-choice framed field experiment, this study elicits consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for fresh produce irrigated with recycled water. It also evaluates consumers' behavioral responses to information about benefits and potential risks of recycled irrigation water. The results suggest that consumers are less willing to pay for produce irrigated with recycled water than for produce irrigated with water of an unspecified type. Information about potential risks associated with recycled water reduces consumers' WTP by nearly 50% while information about its environmental benefits does not have a substantial impact. However, a behavioral intervention that presents individuals with a balanced information treatment leads to a 30% increase in mean WTP for produce irrigated with recycled water relative to the experimental control. However, this effect is only found with vegetables and not with fruit, perhaps because fruit is usually consumed raw. Most of the demographic characteristics analyzed in the experiment did not influence consumers' likelihood of purchasing produce irrigated with recycled water; the exception was presence of a child in the household-those consumers were less likely to purchase produce, particularly fruits, irrigated with recycled water. Finally, consumers experience welfare gains from a labeling policy that provides information about the use of recycled irrigation water.","[Savchenko, Olesya M.; Messer, Kent D.; Xu, Huidong] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Kecinski, Maik] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Li, Tongzhe] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON, Canada",University of Delaware; University of Alberta; University of Windsor,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture [20166800725064]; USDA Economic Research Service [59-6000-4-0064]; Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR),USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture; USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR),"Funding support for this research was provided by the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture (grant number: 20166800725064), that established CONSERVE: A Center of Excellence at the Nexus of Sustainable Water Reuse, Food and Health; the USDA Economic Research Service (grant number: 59-6000-4-0064), and the Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR).

We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers.

A recent study from Ethiopia revealed that, while all age groups consumed calories in proportion to their fair share, iron and protein were inequitably allocated among household members. Further exploration of individual and household characteristics associated with these allocation patterns is necessary to gain a more complete understanding of existing disparities. Objective: This paper sought to quantify energy, protein, and iron allocation inequity between four age and sex groups of household members (children and adults) commonly assumed to be disadvantaged versus preferentially treated in intra-household resource distribution. It then sought to identify individual and household factors that explained the inequity of intra-household nutrient allocation among these paired groups. Methods: Data from a survey of 1185 households located in rural Oromiya and SNNPR regions of Ethiopia. A single quantitative 24-hour household-level dietary recall was collected from the primary food preparer who reported the proportion of household food distributed to each household member. Continuous ratios of relative calorie, protein, and iron adequacy for four pairs of age-sex groups (any child vs. any adult, any child vs. adult male, female child vs. male child, and adult female vs. adult male) in the household were computed and compared, along with a binary indicator of inequity. Logistic regressions and standard linear regression with Huber-White heteroseedasticity-adjusted standard errors were run to determine the predictors of household inequity for each pair-group and nutrient, on the full sample as well as on nutrient inadequate households. Results: Common assumptions about inequitable distribution of nutrients within households were not consistently supported by this analysis. Significant intra-household nutrient inequities did exist in these rural Ethiopian households for certain nutrients, but household subgroups commonly presumed to be nutritionally vulnerable in the Ethiopian context were not always affected by detrimental inequity. Generally, household inequity favored children over adults or adult males, and female children over male children for protein consumption. Inequities were greatest against presumed vulnerable groups (adult women, children) for 'invisible' nutrients (iron) rather than calories or protein. There were relatively few households in which one of the interest groups (groups presumed vulnerable) experienced inequitable nutrient allocation and nutrient inadequacy. The number of households where inequity was present for a subgroup who also experienced nutrient inadequacy while the reference group (group presumed to be preferred) was nutrient adequate was negligible, suggesting that in very few of these household are there members who are haves, benefiting nutritionally to the nutritional detriment of have nots. The analysis of determinants did not reveal any single, consistent set of factors driving decisions across all pair groups and nutrients, but these factors were not substantially different for households that were and were not nutrient adequate. Household dependency ratio, higher relative male education, female household headship, and women's decision-making power provided mixed results for pairwise comparisons. Conclusions: The variable pattern of nutrient inequities underscores the risk of overlooking intra-household nutrient allocation disparity or making assumptions about a particular infra-household food and nutrient distribution pattern in any context where programs are intended to benefit particular household members.","[Coates, Jennifer; Rogers, Beatrice Lorge] Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Patenaude, Bryan N.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Hlth Syst Program, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Roba, Alemzewed Challa] Hawassa Univ, Sch Nutr Food Sci & Technol, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Woldetensay, Yitbarek Kidane] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Biol Chem & Nutr 140a, Stuttgart, Germany; [Tilahun, Addisalem Fikre] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Spielman, Kathryn L.] Populat Council, 4301 Connecticut Ave NW,Suite 280, Washington, DC 20008 USA",Tufts University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Hawassa University; University Hohenheim; Tufts University; Population Council,"Coates, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",Jennifer.coates@tufts.edu; bnp706@mail.harvard.edu; beatrice.rogers@tufts.edu; alemzewed.challa2011@gmail.com; yitbarek.woldetensay@gmail.com; faddis22@gmail.com; kspielman@popcouncil.org,,"Patenaude, Bryan/0000-0002-5180-3626",American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-663-A-11-00017],American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),The authors would like to acknowledge Meghan Kershaw for her assistance in managing the data collection and Dr. Beyene Wondafrash for his role in helping to plan and oversee data collection.

Some African countries, such as Ghana, managed to utilize rapid growth for poverty reduction and improving food and nutrition security. Transformation of agriculture appears to have played an important role in this context. However, the linkages between agricultural transformation and food and nutrition security at the household level are not well understood. This article examines the linkage between farm production diversity and household dietary diversity in rural Ghana and how that linkage changed between 2005-06 and 2012-13. The empirical analysis employs a regression model that controls for region- and time-fixed effects. The estimation results suggest that farm production diversification, as well as household income growth, continues to be strongly associated with increased household dietary diversity. The analysis further explores the mechanism that underlies this production-consumption linkage by systematically modifying the basic model specification.","[Ecker, Olivier] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ecker, O (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",o.ecker@cgiar.org,,"Ecker, Olivier/0000-0001-7549-2511","IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","I am very thankful to several colleagues and former colleagues at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

However, very few empirical studies provide evidence to support these concerns. This paper examines the relationship between women's time spent in domestic work and agriculture and women's and children's dietary diversity. Using data from Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Ghana, and Mozambique, we find that women's domestic work and cooking time are positively correlated with more diverse diets. We also fin differential effects depending on asset poverty status. In Mozambique, working long hours in agriculture is negatively associated with women's dietary diversity score in nonpoor women, but is positively associated with poor women's dietary diversity and poor children's minimum acceptable diet. This suggests that agriculture as a source of food and income is particularly important for the asset poor. Our results reveal that women's time allocation and nutrition responses to agricultural interventions are likely to vary by socioeconomic status and local context.","[Komatsu, Hitomi; Malapit, Hazel Jean L.; Theis, Sophie] IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Komatsu, H (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",hitomi.komatsu@gmail.com,,"Malapit, Hazel/0000-0002-7394-8797","A4NH; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Feed the Future; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, USAID [EEM-G-00-04-00013-00]; US government's global hunger and food security initiative","A4NH; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Feed the Future(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); US government's global hunger and food security initiative","This work was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Programs on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) and Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM).

Using split-sample, choice experiment data from a nationwide online survey of U.S. pork chop eaters, this research determines changes in pork chop demand in response to a potential change in U.S. government policy that would introduce a new pork quality grading system based on color scores. Our simulations include novel short-run projections in which the conditional and latent class logic models are inverted to yield inverse demand curves. The inverse demand curves are used to calculate equilibrium prices and pork revenue given a fixed supply of different pork qualities. We supplement these calculations with a more traditional long run analysis in which prices are fixed and quantities of different qualities adjust. Compared to the status quo (control) of no quality grades, we find that two grading systems based on alternative nomenclatures (Select, Choice, Prime vs. Good, Better, Best) both have the potential to increase pork chop sales and revenue to the pork industry; however, we also find that if only the highest quality is labeled, revenue could fall as the increase in demand for the higher quality is offset by the fall in demand for the lower qualities. Results also highlight important heterogeneity in consumer preferences, and although sensory studies strongly suggest redder pork chops are more highly preferred, there remains a non-trivial share of consumers who prefer whiter pork even after quality grade labeling. Overall, this study offers several insights that can help inform labeling and quality grading policies.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hayes, Dermot J.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Tonsor, Glynn T.; Schroeder, Ted C.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Iowa State University; Kansas State University,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jlusk@purdue.edu; gtonsor@ksu.edu; tcs@ksu.edu; dhayes@iastate.edu,,,National Pork Board and Steve Larsen,National Pork Board and Steve Larsen,We gratefully acknowledge the National Pork Board and Steve Larsen for providing funding to support this project.,,37,29,37,4,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,MAY,2018,77.0,,,,,,91,102,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.04.011,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GJ9UD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000435749500008,0

We build a meta-sample consisting of 1523 food-income elasticities, 369 nutrient-income elasticities, and 123 calorie-income elasticities extracted from 66 primary studies covering 48 African countries. The sample displays a large heterogeneity in income elasticity estimates, which our meta-analysis aims to explain by looking into attributes of the primary studies and characteristics of the countries considered. There are significant differences in the size of the income elasticities across food and nutrient groups. Foods that make up basic diets tend to have lower income elasticities, while elasticities are considerably higher for less basic and more aspirational foods. The role of methodological attributes of the primary studies in explaining heterogeneity is found to be small. Overall, our results confirm that although income growth in Africa will increase food consumption and lead to more nutritionally diverse diets, it is also associated with excessive intakes of fats and sugars, raising concerns about over-, in addition to undernutrition. This suggests that income-based policies can still play a role in the fight against hunger, but that targeted programs are needed to promote nutritionally valuable and healthy diets.","[Colen, L.; Gomez Y Paloma, S.] European Commiss, JRC, Seville, Spain; [Colen, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Melo, P.

Thus, agricultural interventions may fail to improve nutritional outcomes if they do not take account of time constraints, particularly of rural women who spend a considerable portion of their time in agriculture. Given the potential trade-offs pertaining to time in productive vs. reproductive activities and its implications for maternal and child nutrition, the goal of this review is to systematically map and assess the available evidence, both qualitative and quantitative studies, agriculture-time use-nutrition pathway. Through an analysis of 89 studies, identified through a systematic search, on rural areas of low and middle income countries, we observe three findings. First, women play a key role in agriculture, as reflected in their time commitments. Second, evidence from a very limited set of studies suggests that agricultural interventions tend to increase time commitments in agriculture of the household members for whom impact is measured. Third, while changing time use tends to change nutritional outcomes, it does so in a range of complex ways and there is no agreement on the impact. Nutritional impacts are varied because households and household members respond to increased time burden and workload in different ways.","[Johnston, Deborah; Hull, Elizabeth] SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Stevano, Sara] Univ West England UWE Bristol, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Malapit, Hazel J.] IFPRI, WEAI, CGIAR Res Program Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Kadiyala, Suneetha] LSHTM, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of West England; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Johnston, D (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",Dj3@soas.ac.uk; Sara.Stevano@uwe.ac.uk; H.Malapit@cgiar.org; e.hull@soas.ac.uk; Suneetha.Kadiyala@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Kadiyala, Suneetha/0000-0002-9101-1471; Johnston, Deborah/0000-0003-0065-1105; Hull, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1981-3533",Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),"Funding for this research came from Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and from the UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH).

Methods: We conducted 32 interviews with rural corner store owners across six states in response to USDA's proposed rule. We asked owners about potential barriers to and facilitators of stocking healthier foods. Findings: Among the interviews, there were six main themes discussed: (1) SNAP Retailer Rule definition concerns; (2) challenges to implementation; (3) facilitators to implementation; (4) perceptions of SNAP customers; (5) benefits of being a participating retailer in SNAP; and (6) concerns about the threat to the store's economic viability if required to carry additional healthier items in line with the proposed rule. Conclusions: Rural corner stores need help promoting healthier food options, appropriately handling perishable items, finding suppliers that can adhere to their food delivery requirements, and maintaining their SNAP retailer license. Recognizing the implementation challenges of stocking healthier foods for corner stores and presenting feasible solutions to them can improve the likelihood of successful passages of healthy food access policies and programs. Future policies or programs focusing on stocking healthier foods should take into consideration rural corner stores' unique geographic landscape and business practices.","[Haynes-Maslow, Lindsey] NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, 512 Brickhaven Dr Campus Box 7606, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Osborne, Isabel] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 445 Paul Hardin Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Pitts, Stephanie Jilcott] East Carolina Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, 600 Moye Blvd,Lakeside Annex 8,Room 126, Greenville, NC 27834 USA; [Sitaker, Marilyn] Evergreen State Coll, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Byker-Shanks, Carmen] Montana State Univ, Food & Nutr & Sustainable Food Syst, 344 Reid Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Leone, Lucia] Univ Buffalo, 333 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Maldonado, Adriana; Baquero, Barbara] Univ Iowa, Dept Community & Behav Hlth, 145 N Riverside Dr,100 CPHB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [McGuirth, Jared] UNC Greensboro, Dept Nutr, 319 Coll Ave,318 Stone Bldg, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Andress, Lauri] West Virginia Univ, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Leadership, POB 9190 Third Floor,HSC South Room 3305, Morgantown, WV USA; [Bailey-Davis, Lisa] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Geisinger Ctr Hlth Res, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA; [Kolodinsky, Jane] Univ Vermont, Community Dev & Appl Econ, 202 Morrill Hall, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Lo, Brian; Morgan, Emily; Senguin, Rebecca] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Reservoir Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ammerman, Alice] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, 1700 Martin Luther King Blvd,CB 7426, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Iowa; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; West Virginia University; Geisinger Health System; University of Vermont; Cornell University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Haynes-Maslow, L (通讯作者)，NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, 512 Brickhaven Dr Campus Box 7606, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",Lhmaslow@ncsu.edu; iosborne@live.unc.edu; jilcotts@ecu.edu; cbykershanks@montana.edu; lucialeo@buffalo.edu; adriana-maldonado@uiowa.edu; jtmcguir@uncg.edu; LAANDRESS@hsc.wvu.edu; ldbaileydavis@geisinger.edu; barbara-baquero@uiowa.edu; Jane.Kolodinsky@uvm.edu; bl592@cornell.edu; ehm72@cornell.edu; rebeccaseguin@cornell.edu; alice_ammerman@unc.edu,"andress, lauri/AID-9809-2022; Kolodinsky, Jane/AAS-4241-2020","andress, lauri/0000-0001-8326-9635; Kolodinsky, Jane/0000-0001-7322-0889; Byker Shanks, Carmen/0000-0002-9030-9938; Bailey-Davis, Lisa/0000-0002-8781-1521; Haynes-Maslow, Lindsey/0000-0001-9571-1478","Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [5U48-DP001911]","Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","This research was supported by a grant from Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Our findings suggest that women's empowerment is associated with better dietary quality of individuals within the household, but the strength of this association varies across the life course. Women's empowerment is correlated with more diverse diets of children under five, but empowerment measures are not consistently associated with increases in nutrient intake for this age group. Rather, maternal schooling and household socio-economic status play a more important role for younger children. Women's empowerment is positively and significantly associated with adult men's and women's dietary diversity and nutrient intakes. Empowerment does not benefit all individuals within the household equally, with gender bias emerging in adolescence. Variations in the strength of the association between women's empowerment and different individuals' dietary quality across the life course has implications for the design and targeting of interventions to improve dietary quality, particularly of women, children, and adolescent girls.","[Sraboni, Esha] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Quisumbing, Agnes] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brown University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Sraboni, E (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",esha_sraboni@brown.edu,,"Sraboni, Esha/0000-0002-0914-4997","NIH [T32 HD007338, P2C HD041020]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID [EEM-G-00-04-00013-00]; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),"Background support for this study was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for the Policy Research and Strategy Support Program in Bangladesh and the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID Grant Number EEM-G-00-04-00013-00 and the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH).

But evidence on the implications of changing to low carbon food choices for both diet quality and food affordability are limited in the U.S. The objective of this study was to (a) estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) from U.S. household food purchases; (b) examine the source of GHGEs across U.S. food production industries and stages of the supply chain; and (c) show the association between GHGEs and spending by food categories and household sociodemographics. GHGEs from food expenditures made by households participating in the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey were calculated using Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment. Results indicate that food purchases accounted for 16% of U.S. GHGEs in 2013 and average weekly household GHGEs were 71.8 kg carbon dioxide equivalents per standard adult. 68% of average weekly household GHGEs from food spending came from agriculture and food manufacturing stages of the food supply chain. Industries that produce animal proteins accounted for 30% of average weekly household GHGEs, the largest share of any food industry. Households generating the highest levels of GHGEs spent a significantly larger share of their food budget on protein foods compared to households generating lower levels of GHGEs. White households and those with higher education levels generated more GHGEs from food spending compared to non-white and less educated households. Overall these findings inform the ongoing debate about which diets or food spending patterns in the U.S. are best for mitigating GHGEs in the food system and if they are feasible for consumers to purchase.","[Boehm, Rebecca] Univ Connecticut, Zwick Ctr Food & Resource Policy, Rudd Ctr Food Policy & Obes, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Wilde, Parke E.; Cash, Sean B.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Ver Ploeg, Michele] Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Costello, Christine] Univ Missouri, Coll Engn, W1024 Lafferre Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Connecticut; Tufts University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Boehm, R (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Zwick Ctr Food & Resource Policy, Rudd Ctr Food Policy & Obes, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Rebecca.boehm@uconn.edu,"Wilde, Parke/B-6011-2009","Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281; Cash, Sean/0000-0002-7561-3392",Friedman Family Foundation; Tufts University Institute of the Environment,Friedman Family Foundation; Tufts University Institute of the Environment,This work was funded by the Friedman Family Foundation Doctoral Fellowship and the Tufts University Institute of the Environment.,,33,43,58,7,67,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,67,76,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.05.004,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000445993500007,0

Any policy designed to improve food access in non-metro U.S. areas should recognize that improving stores' profitability is crucial to policy success in the long-run. We adapt an empirical entry model to assess the effectiveness of two types of policies to improve food access - demand-stimulating policies (DSP), such as increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars, and supply-side policies (SSP), such as subsidies to reduce establishment costs - by estimating the minimum market size needed for one or more large food stores in non-metro U.S. counties to be profitable. We find that neither type of intervention is preferred a priori and that the cost-effectiveness of each policy type depends upon the presence of an adjacent metropolitan county, the number of preexisting stores, and the duration of the demand-side stimuli. Additionally, our results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of broad-based policy solutions to improve physical access to large food stores or to stimulate demand may be limited when it comes to easing entry in areas with multiple stores.","[Cleary, Rebecca] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B332 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bonanno, Alessandro] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chenarides, Lauren] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall,Santan 235D, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, 207-C Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Arizona State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Bonanno, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rebecca.cleary@colostate.edu; alessandro.bonanno@colostate.edu; lauren.chenarides@asu.edu; sgoetz@psu.edu,,"Cleary, Rebecca/0000-0003-1515-9156; Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X","USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant [2011-68004-30057]; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania Colorado State University; NIFA [2011-68004-30057, 687258] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania Colorado State University; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant No. 2011-68004-30057 (Enhancing the Food Security of Underserved Populations in the Northeast U.S. through Sustainable Regional Food Systems Development) and the Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University and Colorado State University.

We find that upstream use of rivers for bathing and associated sanitary practices can explain as many as 7.5% of all diarrhea-related deaths annually. We also find suggestive evidence for differential avoidance behavior in response to different pollutants.

Duration analysis is employed to measure the duration of U.S. exports and imports of forest products over 1996-2016 and to examine the underlying determinants. Outcomes from the descriptive statistical analysis reveal that the duration of U.S. forest products trade is remarkably short, with a median duration of one quarter based on the quarterly data, or one year for the annual data. The duration of trade spells also varies across different types of forest products. Based on the discrete-time duration model, several determinants of export and import duration are identified at the country and product level. Gravity-type variables (e.g., distance and income) are found to affect the likelihood of trade ceasing. Better endowments in forest resources can improve the survival rate of forest products trade. In designing policies to reduce the pressure of import growth, promote exports of forest products, or have a better trade balance, the differences in trade direction and product features should be considered.","[Sun, Changyou; Zhang, Xufang] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Sun, CY (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",cs258@msstate.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station [15-JV-11261975-024]","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service)","The study was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station under agreement 15-JV-11261975-024.

Results indicate that farmers reduced water use by 26% due to the policy with most of the response due to reductions in water use intensity on the same crops rather than through reductions in irrigated acreage or changes in crops. The results imply that the short run welfare impact of the policy was smaller than a policy that reduces irrigated acreage. (C) 2018 The Authors.

We developed a recreation demand model to monetize economic damages associated with lost shoreline recreational user days attributable to the spill. The unprecedented magnitude of the spill disruption led to a variety of innovations. We estimate a model of shoreline recreation trips to the Gulf Coast region from the general population of the contiguous U.S., combining single and multiple day trips, calculating travel costs that incorporate detailed information on flying costs and transportation mode choice, and using alternative-specific constants to control for site characteristics. Losses per recreational user day are assessed using utility adjustments that reproduce the decline in recreation observed through onsite counts. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate our lost user day value is robust to changes in income imputation, nesting structure, site aggregation and spill calibration, and show the importance of accounting for flying as a mode choice. Estimated losses from the primary shoreline study are $520 million (166) out of the total recreational damages of $661 million (2015$). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, to communicate, prioritize and mitigate such risks it is important to estimate their relative significance. Risk probabilities are typically used, but for existential risks they are problematic due to ambiguity, and because quantitative probabilities do not represent some aspects of these risks. Thus, a standardized and easily comprehensible instrument is called for, to communicate dangers from various global catastrophic and existential risks. In this article, inspired by the Torino scale of asteroid danger, we suggest a color coded scale to communicate the magnitude of global catastrophic and existential risks. The scale is based on the probability intervals of risks in the next century if they are available. The risks' estimations could be adjusted based on their severities and other factors. The scale covers not only existential risks, but smaller size global catastrophic risks. It consists of six color levels, which correspond to previously suggested levels of prevention activity. We estimate artificial intelligence risks as red, while orange risks include nanoteclmology, synthetic biology, full scale nuclear war and a large global agricultural shortfall (caused by regional nuclear war, coincident extreme weather, etc.) The risks of natural pandemic, supervolcanic eruption and global warming are marked as yellow and the danger from asteroids is green.","[Turchin, Alexey] Sci Life Extens Fdn, Moscow, Russia; [Denkenberger, David] Tennessee State Univ, Global Catastroph Risk Inst, Alliance Feed Earth Disasters, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Tennessee State University,"Turchin, A (通讯作者)，Sci Life Extens Fdn, Moscow, Russia.",a.turchin@scienceagainstaging.com; ddenkenb@tnstate.edu,"Denkenberger, David/M-1383-2019",,,,,,69,21,21,2,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,27,38,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.003,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000443666900004,0

We focus our attention on student outliers. Students whose first-year college average is far below expectations (divers) have a high propensity for procrastination they self report cramming for exams and wait longer before starting assignments. They are also considerably less conscientious than their peers. Divers are more likely to express superficial goals, hoping to 'get rich' quickly. In contrast, students who exceed expectations (thrivers) express more philanthropic goals, are purpose-driven, and are willing to study more hours per week to obtain the higher GPA they expect. A simple seven-variable average of these key non-academic variables does well in predicting college achievement relative to adding more variables or letting a machine-algorithm choose, and improves our ability to predict at-risk students when used jointly with past grades.","[Beattie, Graham] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Laliberte, Jean-William P.; Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca,,,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant [435-2015-0180]; JPAL Pilot Grant,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); JPAL Pilot Grant,"We are very grateful to Aloysius Siow, Nathalie Bau, Yosh Halberstarn, Uros Petronijevic for helpful discussions and to seminar participants at the University of Toronto and at the NBER Education meeting for comments.

Overall, we do not find significant associations between MT adoption and reduced deforestation among households in our sample, while higher labor availability and crop yield stimulate expansion.

Rights-based output controls can promote selective fishing; however, this ability may be limited and insufficient in achieving full utilization of catch quotas. We measure fishing selectivity for bottom trawlers catching federally regulated groundfish in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank before and after the introduction of rights-based output controls. Directional distance functions are applied to tow-level catch data collected by fishery observers to construct a measure of selectivity equal to the difference between strong and weak output disposal efficient production frontiers. Quantile regressions are then used to estimate the change in median selectivity associated with the introduction of catch share management, controlling for spatial, temporal, and individual factors. A significant improvement in selectivity was found for tows in Georges Bank following the 2010 management change, though production is still largely characterized by imperfect selectivity.","[Scheld, Andrew M.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Walden, John] NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 166 Water St,MB 19, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Scheld, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",scheld@vims.edu; john.walden@noaa.gov,,"Scheld, Andrew/0000-0001-7490-3040",,,,,38,6,6,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Even within the same specialty and practice location, physicians who completed their initial training at top medical schools write significantly fewer opioid prescriptions annually than physicians from lower-ranked schools. Additional evidence suggests that some of this gradient represents a causal effect of education rather than patient selection across physicians or physician selection across medical schools. Altering physician education may therefore be a useful policy tool in fighting the current epidemic.","[Schnell, Molly; Currie, Janet] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Currie, Janet] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Currie, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Currie, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jcurrie@princeton.edu,,,Program on US Health Policy at the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University,Program on US Health Policy at the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University,Generous financial support from the Program on US Health Policy at the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University is gratefully acknowledged.,,39,61,83,2,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Although most of the measures challenged by the EU were individual tariff lines, the final measure in its complaint was a 'more general measure' referred to as the systematic duty variation. A WTO Dispute Panel eventually ruled that the EU failed to establish the systematic nature of the duty treatment afforded by Russia to certain products. In this paper, we explore the Dispute Panel's ruling, as well as how claims of systematic non-compliance are treated in other legal settings. We conclude by exploring whether future WTO Panels should instead consider statistical evidence of systematic treatment to promote compliance.","[Reynolds, Kara M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Rigod, Boris] Hausfeld LLP, Berlin, Germany",American University,"Reynolds, KM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",reynolds@american.edu; boris.rigod@hausfeld,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,291,312,,10.1017/S1474745617000659,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430704500006,0

One area researchers have not examined is the effects of different school types within the same urban region. We fill this gap by analyzing longitudinal data for students (grades 3-8) in Indianapolis, using student fixed effects models to estimate the impacts of students switching from a traditional public school to a charter, magnet, Catholic, or other private school. We find that students experience no differences in their achievement gains after transferring from a traditional public school to a charter school. However, students switching to magnet schools experience modest annual losses of -0.09 standard deviation (SD) in mathematics and -0.11 SD in English Language Arts. Students switching to Catholic schools also experience annual losses of -0.18 SD in mathematics. These findings are robust to a series of alternative model specifications. Additionally, we find some variability in the mean school type impacts by students' race/ethnicity, English language learner status, and number of years enrolled in a choice school. We discuss our results in the context of the variability of choice school effects across an entire urban area, something future research needs to examine.","[Berends, Mark] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Waddington, R.

This paper investigates the causal impact of participating in a specialized high school-based CTE delivery system on high school persistence, completion, earning professional certifications, and standardized test scores, with a focus on individuals from low-income families, a group that is overrepresented in CTE and high school non-completers. Using administrative data from Massachusetts, I combine ordinary least squares with a regression discontinuity design that capitalizes on admissions data at three schools that are oversubscribed. All estimates suggest that participation in a high-quality CTE program boosts the probability of on-time graduation from high school by 7 to 10 percentage points for higher income students, and suggestively larger effects for their lower-income peers and students on the margin of being admitted to oversubscribed schools. This work informs an understanding of the potential impact of specific CTE program participation on the accumulation of human capital even in a high-stakes policy environment. This evidence of a productive CTE model in Massachusetts may inform the current policy dialog related to improving career pathways and readiness.","[Dougherty, Shaun M.] Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Dept Publ Policy, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Dougherty, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Dept Publ Policy, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",shaun.dougherty@uconn.edu,"Dougherty, Shaun/GVS-8504-2022","Dougherty, Shaun/0000-0003-3362-8948",Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin [456K470]; Smith Richardson Foundation,Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin; Smith Richardson Foundation,"I am grateful to the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin for funding this research (grant no. 456K470), and to the Smith Richardson Foundation for underwriting the July 2014 Building Human Capital and Economic Potential conference.

We show analytically and numerically that the level of emissions leakage depends on the level of trade friction in the service sector. In the model, production in the manufacturing sector is associated with pollution emissions, and production in the service sector is clean. In a special case with free trade in manufacturing and no trade in services, no leakage occurs. Allowing for trade in services, we solve for the relationship between trade frictions in the service sector and leakage. At lower levels of service sector's trade friction, leakage from a small strengthening of environmental regulation decreases (increases) if services are imported (exported). Finally, we simulate the model, calibrating the to the Canadian economy to compare these effects' relative sizes over a range of plausible parameter values. Leakage is about 18% lower when using trade friction levels estimated from the literature rather than assuming no trade friction in services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Further, the experience of the newly industrialized economies suggests that human capital investments will be a vital ingredient of the transition from middle income to high income. Those investments can also affect equity and public finances. In this article, we use data from the National Transfer Accounts to empirically analyze the effect of human capital investment in Asian countries on economic growth, inequality, and fiscal balance. Our empirical evidence suggests that human capital investments have a positive effect on labor productivity and, hence, output. The positive effect is stronger for poorer households and, hence, beneficial for equity. We also find that such investments can generate sufficient tax revenues to improve the fiscal balance. Overall, our evidence points to a positive effect of human capital on growth, equity, and fiscal balance in Asia.","[Abrigo, Michael R.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved in many countries for ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. Estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDX as a first- or second-line treatment for adults with ADHD from the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) perspective compared with methylphenidate extended release (MPH-ER) and atomoxetine (ATX). A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed. Health outcomes included response, non-response and inability to tolerate. Efficacy data were obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). Response was a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Utilities were identified via a systematic literature review. Health care resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were estimated from mean doses reported in the trials used in the MTC. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. LDX dominated MPH-ER and ATX; reducing mean per-patient annual cost by A 5 pound and A 200 pound, and increasing mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. In the PSA, the probability of cost-effectiveness for LDX vs. MPH-ER and ATX at a threshold of A 20,000 pound per QALY was 61% and 80%, respectively. From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX is likely to provide a cost-effective treatment for adults with ADHD.

However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics","[Cooper, Matthew; Zvoleff, Alex; Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano; Noon, Monica; Alele, Peter] Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr 500, Arlington, VA 20222 USA; [Cooper, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 Samuel J LeFrak Hall,7251 Preinkert Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Tusiime, Felly] Africa Innovat Inst, Plot 1544,Old Kiira Rd, Kampala, Uganda; [Musumba, Mark] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, POB 110180, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Nyiratuza, Madeleine] Wildlife Conservat Soc, KG 635 St, Kigali, Rwanda",Conservation International; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Cooper, M (通讯作者)，Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr 500, Arlington, VA 20222 USA.",mattcoop@terpmail.umd.edu; azvoleff@conservation.org; mgonzalez-roglich@conservation.org; mmusumba@ufl.edu; mnoon@conservation.org; palele@conservation.org; mnyiratuza@wcs.org,"Zvoleff, Alexander/P-4813-2019; Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021; Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano/J-7510-2019","Zvoleff, Alexander/0000-0002-6008-4918; Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-7133-3801","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [OPPGD943, OPP1140919]; Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY [016 GRP 301]; MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL [15-107423-000-INP]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGD943, OPP1140919] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)","This work was made possible through grants OPPGD943 and OPP1140919 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA; grant 016 GRP 301 from the Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; and grant 15-107423-000-INP from the MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL.

Novel evidence from Burkina Faso,HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community-based targeting; Targeting; Ultra-poor; Pro-poor targeting; Activity-based costing; Burkina Faso; Costs; Economic evaluation,EQUITY; CARE,"Background: Targeting efforts aimed at increasing access to care for the poorest by reducing to a minimum or completely eliminating payments at point of use are increasingly being adopted across low and middle income countries, within the framework of Universal Health Coverage policies. No evidence, however, is available on the real cost of designing and implementing these efforts. Our study aimed to fill this gap in knowledge through the systematic assessment of both the financial and economic costs associated with designing and implementing a pro-poor community-based targeting intervention across eight districts in rural Burkina Faso. Methods: We conducted a partial retrospective economic evaluation (i.e. estimating costs, but not benefits) associated with the abovementioned targeting intervention. We adopted a health system perspective, including all costs incurred by the government and its development partners as well as costs incurred by the community when working as volunteers on behalf of government structures. To trace both financial and economic costs, we combined Activity-Based Costing with Resource Consumption Accounting. To this purpose, we consulted and extracted information from all relevant design/implementation documents and conducted additional key informant structured interviews to assess the resource consumption that was not valued in the documents. Results: For the entire community-based targeting intervention, we estimated a financial cost of USD 587,510 and an economic cost of USD 1,213,447. The difference was driven primarily by the value of the time contributed by the community. Communities carried the main economic burden. With a total of 102,609 ultra-poor identified, the financial cost and the economic cost per ultra-poor person were respectively USD 5,73 and USD 11,83. Conclusion: The study is first of its kind to accurately trace the financial and economic costs of a community-based targeting intervention aiming to identify the ultra-poor. The financial costs amounted to USD 5,73 and the economic costs to USD 11,83 per ultra-poor person identified. The financial costs of almost USD 6 represents 21% of the per capita government expenditure on health.","[Beauge, Yvonne; Koulidiati, Jean-Louis; De Allegri, Manuela] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ridde, Valery] Univ Paris Sorbonne Cites, Univ Paris Descartes, IRD,SAGESUD, IRD French Inst Res Sustainable Dev,CEPED,ERL,INS, Paris, France; [Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst IRSPUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Robyn, Paul Jacob] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Montreal; The World Bank,"Beaugé, Y (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany.",yvonne.beauge@uni-heidelberg.de,"Ridde, Valery/AAD-2736-2019; ridde, valery/AAV-1016-2020","Ridde, Valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; ridde, valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; De Allegri, Manuela/0000-0002-8677-1337; Beauge, Yvonne/0000-0002-9658-2417","Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University","Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University","Data collection and YB's position for the duration of the study were funded directly by the Research Group in Health Economics and Health Financing of the Institute of Public Health, Heidelberg University.",,41,6,6,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Salience stimulates extra donations for the NGO, and thus firms have incentives to hide the damage they do in order to avoid public attention. We show that when public attention is scarce, a greater campaign orientation induces industry to invest in greater obfuscation, starving the NGO of funds. The NGO in turn strategically biases its mission away from campaigns and in favor of sector-wide versus firm-specific campaigns but not by as much as a welfare-motivated planner would want. When public attention is avoided by a mixture of substantive and symbolic action, we show that a greater weight on the former induces the NGO to become more campaign-oriented, with social damage lower. Highly competitive industries have greater incentives to commit to substantive actions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Companies can hire socially responsible employees who enjoy correcting spillovers. Because firms can capture rents created by allowing this, they sometimes find it optimal to lobby for inefficient rules and then encourage socially responsible behavior in their midst.

The experiments were conducted both in the field with TURF users and in the lab with university students. Our study has two objectives. First, we designed our experiments to study the effects of poaching on the ability of common pool resource users to coordinate their harvests when encroachment by outsiders is unrestricted and when the government provides weak enforcement. Second, we examine the ability of common pool resource users to simultaneously coordinate their harvests and investments in monitoring to deter poaching with and without government assistance in monitoring. Weak external monitoring that was predicted to have no effect actually led to significantly lower poaching relative to unrestricted poaching. However, neither giving sole responsibility for monitoring to resource users nor combining user and government monitoring affected poaching levels much. Our results suggest that users of a common pool resource may have difficulties coordinating their efforts to deter poachers, even with help from government authorities. We find no important qualitative differences in the behavior of TURF users and university students. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The dispute centers on the appropriate use of trade measures to target trade-related money laundering, the WTO consistency of such measures, and an ancillary question of appropriate time for remedies to be applied. The economics of the measures employed do not directly target the ostensible justification for the measures, while Colombia failed to convince the Panel and Appellate Body of key points related to the necessity of the measures taken. There has been success targeting trade-related money laundering following from cooperation of customs authorities and financial regulators to more directly target the agents involved. There may be a role for the WTO, in the form of steps taken to encourage such cooperation (as in Argentina - Measures Relating to Trade in Goods and Services). The basic lesson is that second best, blunt, and likely misdirected policies are not easily justified at the WTO, though more direct measures may be.","[Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Whittaker, Janet] Clifford Chance US LLP, Washington, DC USA",University of Bern,"Francois, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",joseph.francois@gmail.com; Janet.Whittaker@cliffordchance.com,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,335,352,,10.1017/S1474745617000623,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430704500008,0

Using the Global Forest Products Model, multiple replications of projections were carried out with parameters or initial condition data sampled randomly from their assumed distribution. The results showed that parameter uncertainty led to uncertainty of the projections increasing steadily with the time horizon, and more rapidly than the uncertainty stemming from initial conditions. Among the parameter uncertainties, those in the supply and demand elasticities tended to dominate the uncertainty in the other parameters describing forest growth, manufacturing activities, and trade inertia. In an application to impact analysis it was found that, due only to the uncertainty of the model parameters, and conditional on other assumptions, an assumed rise in global temperature of 2.8 degrees C over a century caused the forest stock in 2065 to be 2.4% to 4.0% higher in developed countries, and 2.5% to 3.9% lower in developing countries, with 68% probability, a conservative estimate of the true uncertainty given all the other factors involved in such a prediction.","[Buongiorno, Joseph; Johnston, Craig] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Buongiorno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jbuongio@wisc.edu,,,USDA Forest Service [17-JV-11330143-087],USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"The research leading to this paper was supported in part by USDA Forest Service Joint Venture Agreement17-JV-11330143-087, in cooperation with project leader Jeff Prestemon.",,29,11,12,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,10,17,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.006,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438180100002,0

Small-scale timber producers have been marginalized in the sector in the past, and the new regulations claim to provide pathways to formalization for these actors. We draw on policy analysis and field research in the central Amazon region of Peru using mixed methods to characterize smallholder on-farm timber production and evaluate the feasibility of the new regulatory mechanisms for formalizing small-scale timber producers. Through examining a case study on the production and sale of the fast-growing pioneer timber species Guazuma crinita, locally known as bolaina, we found a diversity of management practices, with the strongest reliance on natural regeneration in agricultural fallows, an informal supply chain, and no case of formal documentation at time of sale. We assessed that none of the new regulatory mechanisms will accommodate the sale of timber produced in agricultural fallow stands. We recommend the inclusion of fallow timber in the new forest plantation registry, which could result in the formalization of the supply chain and create an incentive to increase production by small-scale producers.","[Sears, Robin R.; Cronkleton, Peter; Polo Villanueva, Fredy; Miranda Ruiz, Medardo; Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matfas] CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima, Peru; [Polo Villanueva, Fredy] Ctr Innovac Cient Amazon CINCIA, Jr Cajamarca Cuadra 1, Puerto Maldonado, Madre De Dios, Peru; [Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matfas] Wagenigen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change Grp, UR, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Sears, RR (通讯作者)，CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima, Peru.;Sears, RR (通讯作者)，Hampshire Coll, 893 West St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",robin.sears@aya.yale.edu,,"Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matias/0000-0003-2616-4161; Sears, Robin/0000-0002-8925-1441; Cronkleton, Peter/0000-0002-3638-7417; Polo Villanueva, Fredy/0000-0002-9047-5223","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)(CGIAR)","This study was carried out in 2015 with the financial support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, and the Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA).",,40,16,17,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,49,58,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.11.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000423640000005,0

In contrast, I find a pumping fee implemented by a group of irrigators in Southern Colorado effectively crowds-in pro-conservation norms, enhancing the financial incentive's impact. Using a unique, spatially oriented panel-data set of groundwater wells, I separate the direct role of increased pumping costs from the indirect effect transmitted through altered conservation norms. To quantify conservation behavior, I estimate how pumping at one well responds to pumping at nearby wells using instrumental variables to address simultaneity bias and interact that behavior with a difference-in-difference framework to assess the influence of the intervention. In the preferred specification, the fee directly accounts for approximately 74% of the reduced pumping and the remaining 26% comes from crowding in conservation norms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Further analysis reveals a sharp gender division in patterns of family care in China. While men are more likely to receive care from their wives, women are primarily cared for by their children. Marital status and spouse health also affect provision of care, with infirm women who have healthy husbands less likely to receive care than infirm men with healthy wives. The findings have important implications for designing gender-sensitive policies in eldercare.","[Chen, Xinxin] Peking Univ, Inst Social Sci Survey, Room 528,5 Sci Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Giles, John] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wang, Yafeng] Peking Univ, Inst Social Sci Survey, Room 614,5 Sci Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; The World Bank; Peking University; Peking University,"Chen, XX (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Social Sci Survey, Room 528,5 Sci Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",xinxinchen.zjgsu@gmail.com; jgiles@worldbank.org; econyfwang@gmail.com; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023","Giles, John/0000-0003-1935-6632; Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715","National Institute on Ageing [R01AG037031, R03AG049144]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71603013, 71273237, 7130002, 71450001]; Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank [RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579]; China Medical Board [16-249]",National Institute on Ageing(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank; International Development Research Center of Canada; China Medical Board,"This work was supported by the International Development Research Center of Canada [107579], the Natural Science Foundation of China [71450001; 71273237; 7130002; 71603013], the Knowledge for Change Program at the World Bank [RF-P131518-RESE-TF015161], National Institute on Ageing [R01AG037031, R03AG049144], and China Medical Board [16-249].

A range of scientific methods for developing scenarios is available, but we argue that they have limited capacity to investigate complex social-ecological futures because: 1) non-linear change is rarely incorporated and: 2) they rarely involve co-evolutionary dynamics of integrated social-ecological systems. This manuscript intends to address these two concerns by applying the method of science fiction prototyping to developing scenarios for the future of global fisheries in a changing global ocean. We used an empirically informed background on existing and emerging trends in marine natural resource use and dynamics to develop four 'radical ocean futures,' incorporating and extrapolating from existing environmental, technological, social and economic trends. We argue that the distinctive method as applied here can complement existing scenario methodologies and assist scientists in developing a holistic understanding of complex systems dynamics. The approach holds promise for making scenarios more accessible and interesting to non-academics and can be useful for developing proactive governance mechanisms.","[Merrie, Andrew; Metian, Marc; Osterblom, Henrik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Keys, Patrick] Colorado State Univ, Sch Global Environm Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Metian, Marc] IAEA, Environm Labs, 4a Quai Antoine Ier, MC-98000 Principality Monaco, Monaco",Stockholm University; Colorado State University,"Merrie, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",andrew.merrie@su.se,"Metian, Marc/F-8010-2018; Keys, Patrick/AAK-1359-2021; Osterblom, Henrik G/D-4249-2012","Metian, Marc/0000-0003-1485-5029; Keys, Patrick/0000-0002-7250-1563; Osterblom, Henrik/0000-0002-1913-5197",Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM) Program,Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research); Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM) Program,"The Nippon Foundation-University of British Columbia Nereus program is a collaborative initiative by the Nippon Foundation, The University of British Columbia, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and four additional partners.

While many studies have investigated the relationship between violence against children and health of the victims, little is known about the long term economic consequences of child maltreatment, especially in developing countries. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Study, this paper applies Heckman selection models to investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and young adults' wages in South Africa. The results show that, on average, any experience of physical or emotional abuse during childhood is associated with a later 12% loss of young adults' wages. In addition, the correlation between physical abuse and economic consequence (14%) is more significant than the relationship between emotional abuse and wages (8%) of young adults; and the higher the frequency of maltreatment, the greater the associations with wages. With respect to gender differences, wage loss due to the experience of childhood maltreatment is larger for females than males. Specifically, males' wages are more sensitive to childhood emotional abuse, while females' wages are more likely to be affected by childhood physical abuse. These results emphasize the importance of prioritizing investments in prevention and intervention programs to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment and to help victims better overcome the long-term negative effect.","[Zheng, Xiaodong; Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xiangming] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Fry, Deborah A.; Casey, Tabitha] Univ Edinburgh, Moray House Sch Educ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ganz, Gary; Ward, Catherine L.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Psychol, Cape Town, South Africa; [Hsiao, Celia] Save Children South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa",China Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Edinburgh; University of Cape Town; Save the Children,"Fang, XM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Fang, XM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 140 Decatur St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",xmfang@cau.edu.cn,"Fang, Xiangming/B-8650-2014; Ward, Catherine L./ACR-5809-2022; Fang, Xiangming/O-1653-2014","Ward, Catherine L./0000-0001-8727-4175; Fang, Xiangming/0000-0001-9922-8977",,,,,64,4,6,0,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

One alternative for increasing carbon sequestration is to convert pasture to forest while either reducing animal numbers or increasing cattle stocking density on more productive pastureland. This study uses data from a survey of beef cattle producers in the eastern United States to determine: (i) interest in afforesting pastureland; (ii) contingent upon interest, willingness to participate in a hypothetical afforestation program; and (iii) contingent upon willingness to participate, participation intensity in the form of enrolled acres. Less than one-third of producers were interested in afforesting pasture. Producer interest was associated with beliefs about the on- and off-farm effects of afforestation, risk aversion, age, educational attainment, opportunity costs, forest ownership, and previous experience with afforestation. Willingness to participate in the program was influenced by the incentive offered, household income, and opportunity costs. Respondents willing to participate in the program were willing to afforest an average of 55 acres, given the incentive offered. Producers with larger farms were willing to enroll more acres. Extrapolating these results to the population of beef cattle producers in the eastern United States provides a measure of the potential for pasture afforestation and carbon sequestration.","[Claytor, Hannah S.] Knoxville Utilities Board, Knoxville, TN USA; [Clark, Christopher D.; Lambert, Dayton M.; Jensen, Kimberly L.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Clark, CD (通讯作者)，302 Morgan Hall,2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cdclark@utk.edu,"Lambert, Dayton/A-8401-2009; Clark, Christopher D/A-2073-2012","Clark, Christopher D/0000-0002-7735-4101; Jensen, Kimberly/0000-0001-7922-2324","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [10642663]","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture","This project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 10642663 from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture.",,60,8,9,0,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,43,54,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.03.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000435750000005,0

Creating value and mitigating harm are typically explicit in the objects of public policy and implicit in adjudication, administration and adherence under public policies. Although conceptually distinct, creating value and mitigating harm can be both complementary and detrimental to each other. This article reviews various combinations of legislative objects over more than a century of Australian labour and employment relations policy. The objects examined include the prevention of industrial disputes, the introduction of a social minimum wage, the expansion of enterprise bargaining, expansion or curtailment of tribunal powers by government and other developments. Questions of for whom?' value is created or harm is mitigated are key. As an inductive study, the article concludes with hypotheses to guide future research, including implications that reach beyond Australia and employment legislation.","[Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel E.] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, 415 South St, Auburndale, MA 02466 USA; [Isaac, Joe] Monash Univ, Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Brandeis University; Monash University,"Cutcher-Gershenfeld, JE (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, 415 South St, Auburndale, MA 02466 USA.",joelcg@brandeis.edu,"Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel/ABF-5729-2020","Cutcher-Gershenfeld, Joel/0000-0001-7659-7024",,,,,60,4,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Students believe that salaries are 13% higher than they actually are, on average, and students underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25%.

While previous studies have relied on aggregate measures of timber values, the detailed forest condition measures allow for site-specific estimates of timber quasi-rents, providing new and unique insights into the influence of timber market conditions on land use changes. Results provide an empirical analysis of the influence of timber rent on transitions to all other uses and specifically show that higher timber rents reduce transitions of forests to all other rural land uses as well as to developed land uses The latter finding is unique and provides support for the claim that stronger timber markets enhance the area of forests and alter patterns of land use change including patterns of development in the southeastern United States.","[Kim, Taek Joo; Li, Ruhong] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Wear, David N.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, Ctr Integrated Forest Sci, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Coulston, John] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 1710 Res Ctr Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Kim, TJ (通讯作者)，US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",tjkim@ncsu.edu; dwear@fs.fed.us; jcoulston@fs.fed.us; rnli@ncsu.edu,,,USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program,USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program,Funding for this project was provided by the USDA Forest Service RPA Assessment Program.,,25,9,12,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,45,52,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.012,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438180100006,0

Though immensely popular and highly selective, their policy of admitting students using a single entrance exam has raised questions about diversity and equity in access. In this paper, we provide a descriptive analysis of the pipeline from middle school to matriculation at a specialized high school, identifying group-level differences in application, admission, and enrollment. In doing so, we highlight potential points of intervention to improve access for underrepresented groups. Controlling for other measures of prior achievement, we find black, Hispanic, low-income, and female students are significantly less likely to qualify for admission to a specialized high school. Differences in application and matriculation rates also affect the diversity in these schools, and we find evidence of middle school effects on both application and admission. Simulated policies that offer admissions using alternative measures, such as state test scores and grades, suggest many more girls, Hispanics, and white students would be admitted under these alternatives. They would not, however, appreciably increase the share of offers given to black or low-income students.","[Corcoran, Sean Patrick; Baker-Smith, E.

Selection and policies matter,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Self-reported health status; Immigration; Europe; Israel; Older population; Multilevel regression; SHARE,ASSIMILATION,"Previous literature on a variety of countries has documented a healthy immigrant effect (HIE). Accordingly, immigrants arriving in the host country are, on average, healthier than comparable natives. However, their health status dissipates with additional years in the country. HIE is explained through the positive self-selection of healthy immigrants as well as the positive selection, screening and discrimination applied by host countries. In this article we study the health trajectories of immigrants within the context of selection and migration policies. Using SHARE data we examine the HIE, comparing Israel and 16 European countries that have fundamentally different migration policies. Israel has virtually unrestricted open gates for Jewish people around the world, who in turn have ideological rather than economic considerations to move. European countries have selective policies with regards to the health, education and wealth of migrants, who also self-select themselves. Our results provide evidence that (1) immigrants who move to Israel have compromised health and are significantly less healthy than comparable natives. Their health disadvantage persists for up to 20 years of living in Israel, after which they become similar to natives; (2) immigrants who move to Europe have significantly better health than comparable natives. Their health advantage remains positive for many years. Even though during some time lapses they are not significantly different from natives, their health status never becomes worse than that of natives. Our results are important for migration policy and relevant for domestic health policy.","[Constant, Amelie F.] Princeton Univ, Off Populat Res, 189 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Constant, Amelie F.] Maastrich Univ, UNU Merit, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Garcia-Munoz, Teresa] Univ Granada, Dept Quantitat Methods, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Neuman, Shoshana] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Neuman, Shoshana] Acad Ashkelon Coll, Sch Econ, Ashqelon, Israel; [Neuman, Shoshana] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Neuman, Tzahi] Hadassah Hebrew Univ, Med Ctr, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel",Princeton University; Maastricht University; University of Granada; Bar Ilan University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center,"Constant, AF (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Off Populat Res, 189 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Constant, AF (通讯作者)，Maastrich Univ, UNU Merit, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",afconstant299@gmail.com; tgarciam@ugr.es; shoshana.neuman@biu.ac.il; TNeuman@hadassah.org.il,"García-Muñoz, Teresa/J-2748-2018; Constant, Amelie F./N-4457-2016","Constant, Amelie F./0000-0002-5817-8579","MICINN [ECO2013-44879-R]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-1436]; European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; German Ministry of Education and Research; US National Institute on Aging [U01_AG09740-13S2, P01_AG005842, P01_AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064]",MICINN(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); US National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"Teresa Garcia-Munoz would like to thank MICINN (ECO2013-44879-R) and Junta de Andalucia (SEJ-1436) for financial support.; The SHARE data collection has been primarily funded by the European Commission through FP5 (QLK6-CT-2001-00360), FP6 (SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812) and FP7 (SHARE-PREP: No211909, SHARE-LEAP: No227822, SHARE M4: No261982).

Of interest to applied researchers, our results quantify the tradeoffs between model run-time, accuracy, and precision of welfare estimates associated with samples of different sizes. Moreover, although our results confirm that larger efficiency losses arise with smaller samples as theory would predict, they also suggest that depending on researcher needs, random samples as small as 28 alternatives (5% of the full set of alternatives in our application) can produce relatively accurate welfare estimates that are useful for exploratory modeling, sensitivity analysis, and policy purposes.

We find that an increase in dry-season rainfall leads to an increase in agricultural production and dampens conflict intensity. By contrast, an increase in wet-season rainfall is harmful to crops and produces more conflict. Consistent with the hypothesis that rebel groups gain strength after a bad harvest, we find that negative rainfall shocks lead to an increase in conflict incidents initiated by insurgents but not by government forces. These results suggest that the predicted shift towards wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will lead to more civil conflict even if annual rainfall totals remain stable. We conclude that policies aimed at mitigating the effect of climate change on agriculture could have the added benefit of reducing civil conflict. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper quantifies the energy savings of the Energize Phoenix program in Phoenix, Arizona. Impacts of retrofits are analyzed using pre-post treatment billing data from January 2008 to April 2013, covering 201 residential buildings and 636 commercial buildings. There are five types of retrofits for residential buildings and six types for commercial buildings. Empirical results from fixed effects panel regression models indicate monthly energy savings of 12% for commercial buildings and 8% for residential buildings. The realized energy savings are 30-50% lower than those predicted by engineering models. We have also separated the energy savings provided by individual retrofits and retrofit bundles, and estimate how the effectiveness of retrofits varies based on building attributes, all of which should be considered when making energy efficiency decisions. Learning effects are also observed in this program, which means as the post-retrofit time increases, there is a possibility for improved learning and control of energy use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Hakobyan, S",,,,"Hakobyan, Shushanik",,,Do Anti-dumping Duties Still Matter? The Curious Case of Aluminum Foil,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,TRADE DIVERSION,"In 2009, the EU imposed anti-dumping duties on aluminum foil imported from Armenia, Brazil, and China for five years. The final determination resulted in the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties of 13.4% (Armenia), 17.6% (Brazil), and 6.4-30% (China). This paper quantifies the direct and indirect effects of the EU anti-dumping duty on EU and US imports from targeted and unaffected countries using detailed data for the years 2006 through 2012, and controlling for exports of all products within the aluminum sheet, plate, and foil manufacturing industry from all countries. The findings point to the trade destruction, trade depression, trade diversion, and trade deflection effects typically found in the existing literature. However, the uniqueness of this case lies in the fact that the Armenian exporter is a subsidiary of a Russian firm. And as Armenia's exports to the EU declined, they expanded rapidly to the US. At the same time, the US imports from Russia, a country not directly touched by the anti-dumping ruling, declined dramatically, and were diverted to the EU. This points to the potential ineffectiveness of anti-dumping duties in the presence of multinational corporations with production facilities located across countries differentially impacted by anti-dumping duties.","[Hakobyan, Shushanik] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Hakobyan, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",shakobyan@imf.org,,,,,,,7,1,1,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2018,17.0,4,,,,,557,574,,10.1017/S1474745617000465,0.0,,,18,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GX1QX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000447494100001,0

Using the case of Maryland's Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act, this paper extends the current literature by developing a conceptual framework for residential bidding and sorting and using it to estimate housing market responses to the Maryland state aid reform. With repeat-sales data and many control variables, we find that an increase of $1,000 in current state aid per pupil induced by the reform is associated with an increase of 5 percent to 13 percent in property values. Moreover, within a district the property-value increases are greater in higher-income tracts, where the demand for school quality is likely to be greater.","[Chung, Il Hwan] Soongsil Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Seoul 06978, South Korea; [Duncombe, William] Syracuse Univ, Publ Adm, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Yinger, John] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Soongsil University; Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Chung, IH (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Seoul 06978, South Korea.",ih.chung@ssu.ac.kr; jyinger@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This paper marshals data from a variety of sources to rigorously assess the issue. It begins by using a large survey dataset to trace the evolution in families' child care expenditures. I find that the typical family currently spends 14 percent more on child care than it did in 1990. This is less than half the increase documented in previous work. In addition, most families allocate approximately the same share of income to child care as they did several decades ago. The next section of the paper examines the trend in the market price of child care. The evidence suggests that after persistent, albeit modest, growth throughout the 1990s, market prices have been essentially flat for at least a decade. In the paper's final section, I analyze several features of the child care market that may have implications for prices, including the demand for child care, the skill-level of the child care workforce, and state regulations. A few findings are noteworthy. First, I show that child care demand stagnated around the same time that market prices leveled-off. Second, although the skill-level of the child care workforce increased in absolute terms, highly-educated women increasingly find child care employment less attractive than other occupations. Finally, child care regulations have not systematically increased in stringency, and they appear to have small and inconsistent effects on market prices. Together, these results indicate that the production of child care has not become more costly, which may explain the recent stagnation in market prices.","[Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,38,20,25,2,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We focus on cardiologists treating patients with a first-time heart attack treated in the emergency room. Physician concentration has a small but statistically significant effect on service utilization. Cardiologists in more concentrated markets perform more intensive procedures, particularly diagnostic proceduresservices in which the procedure choice is more discretionary. Higher concentration leads to fewer readmissions but has no effect on mortality.

In this paper, we estimate the effects of MMLs on secondary and post-secondary students' time use using data from the American Time Use Survey. We apply a difference-in-differences research design and estimate flexible fixed effects models that condition on state fixed effects and state-specific time trends. We find no effect of MMLs on secondary students' time use. However, we find that college students in MML states spend approximately 20% less time on education-related activities and 20% more time on leisure activities than their counterparts in non-MML states. These behavioral responses largely occur during weekends and summer when students have more spare time. Finally, the impacts of MMLs are heterogeneous and stronger among part-time college students, who are more likely to be first-generation college goers and to come from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.","[Chu, Yu-Wei Luke] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gershenson, Seth] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Victoria University Wellington; American University,"Chu, YWL (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",Luke.chu@vuw.ac.nz; gershens@american.edu,,"Chu, Yu-Wei Luke/0000-0002-8537-3468",,,,,82,7,11,0,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We find that all four methods are effective relative to the control group (a mass e-mail solicitation) at increasing applications but only suggestive evidence for increasing matriculation. We observe a few differences in the relative effectiveness of the methods. We complete a simple cost-effectiveness analysis that suggests the admissions call is the preferred method.

For example, these events can reduce instructional time by causing teacher and student absences, school closures, and disturbances to classroom and home routines. This paper uses a quasi-experimental research design to identify the effects of the 2002 Beltway Sniper attacks on student achievement in Virginia's public elementary schools. To identify the causal impact of these events, the empirical analysis uses a difference-indifferences strategy that exploits geographic variation in schools' proximity to the attacks. The main results indicate that the attacks significantly reduced school-level proficiency rates in schools within five miles of an attack. Evidence of a causal effect is most robust for math proficiency rates in the third and fifth grades, and third-grade reading proficiency, suggesting that the shootings caused a decline in school proficiency rates of about 2 to 5 percent. Particularly concerning from an equity standpoint, these effects appear to be entirely driven by achievement dedines in schools that serve higher proportions of racial minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Finally, results from supplementary analyses suggest these deleterious effects faded out in subsequent years.","[Gershenson, Seth; Tekin, Erdal] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Gershenson, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",gershens@american.edu; tekin@american.edu,,,,,,,63,27,42,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the turnaround program did not improve, and may have reduced, average school-level passing rates in math and reading. One potential contributor to that finding appears to be that the program increased the concentration of low-income students in treated schools. Based on teacher survey data, we find that, as was intended, treated schools brought in new principals and increased the time teachers devoted to professional development. At the same time, the program increased administrative burdens and distracted teachers, potentially reducing time available for instruction, and increased teacher turnover after the first full year of implementation. Overall, we find little evidence of success for North Carolina's efforts to turn around low-performing schools under its Race to the Top grant.

The strategy is formulaic, and the net effect is a curious one, which the authors refer to as the scenario planning paradox. Contributing fresh theory supposedly attends to the dismal state of theory, while contributing new typologies purportedly helps bring order to methodological chaos. Repeated over time, the contribution strategy breaks down. Effort to resolve the theoretical and methodological issue, which motivates re-statement of the claim in the first place, ultimately fails. In actuality, the field is distanced from its purported goals. The dismal state of theory encourages scholars to adopt theory that is not necessarily tethered to a common core, which does not contribute to a shared, foundational theoretical perspective in futures studies. Perceived chaos gives way to typologies, which, as they mount, contribute to the chaos they were meant to resolve. The end result, intended by no one, is that theory remains dismal and methods remain chaotic. This direction for the field is indefensible and untenable; either the field accepts this claim as a statement of truth, for which the solution is substantially enhanced empiricism, or rejects the claim and re-interprets the bounty produced by said claim to be a kind of richness in theory and method rather than the implicit paucity, poverty, and imperfection that they oft signify to the field now.","[Spaniol, Matthew J.] Danish Maritime, Symfonivej 18, DK-2730 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Spaniol, Matthew J.] Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Rowland, Nicholas J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Roskilde University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Spaniol, MJ (通讯作者)，Danish Maritime, Symfonivej 18, DK-2730 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Spaniol, MJ (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.;Rowland, NJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",matt@ruc.dk; njr12@psu.edu,,"Rowland, Nicholas/0000-0003-2917-578X; Spaniol, Matthew/0000-0002-1216-4630",Den Danske Maritime Fond [2013-028]; Danish Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation [135500110B],Den Danske Maritime Fond; Danish Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation,Matthew J.

We develop a general equilibrium model of an RPS policy that captures key features such as a fixed factor renewable endowment, substitution across sectors of the economy, and endogenous price responses. We analytically decompose the effects of an RPS into a) a substitution effect, b) an output-tax effect, and c) an output effect. We show that an increase in the RPS can either deliver large resource booms or large emissions savings but not both.

To bound the true implicit prices, researchers sometimes study high profile cases involving significant media and community attention. However, prior research finds that high-profile cases may lead to stigma effects that can confound interpretation of the results. This study compares these opposing effects at sixteen of the highest profile underground storage tank releases across the United States over the last thirty years. Using covariate matching and difference-in-differences hedonic regressions, we estimate the change in housing values around each site. We then conduct a cross-site meta-analysis to estimate the average treatment effects. We find an average housing price depreciation of 2-6% upon discovery of a release, which is an upper bound on the implicit price of contamination at more typical sites. Following cleanup, we find a housing price appreciation of a similar magnitude, suggesting that even in high-profile cases, surrounding neighborhoods do not experience persistent stigma.

Moreover, optimal marginal abatement investment costs differ across sectors of the economy. It may be preferable to spend $25 to avoid the marginal ton of carbon in a sector where abatement capital is expensive, such as public transportation, or in a sector with large abatement potential, such as the power sector, than $15 for the marginal ton in a sector with lower cost or lower abatement potential. The reason, distinct from learning spillovers, is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires investment in long-lived abatement capital such as clean power plants or public transport infrastructure. The value of abatement investment comes from avoided emissions, but also from the value of abatement capital in the future. The optimal levelized cost of conserved carbon can thus be higher than the optimal carbon price. It is higher in sectors with higher investment needs: those where abatement capital is more expensive or sectors with larger abatement potential. We compare our approach to the traditional abatement-cost-curve model and discuss implications for policy design.

However, this article argues that in theories of finance, the SVO is a manifestation of only one of the logic models followed by investors-that of equity investment. Equally important, according to these theories, is the logic of debt investment which is often at odds with the logic of equity investment. This article demonstrates that overlooked influential actors in the field of corporate finance that subscribe to this logic of debt investment, i.e. bond rating agencies, are actively discouraging the spread of shareholder value-driven corporate practices via the bond rating process.

Economic factors associated with growth appear to differ between middle-income and other countries. The efficiency of the financial system is importantly related to the growth rate in low- and middle-income countries, but appears to matter less as one moves up the income scale. Demographic variables also matter importantly in low-income countries. In middle-income countries, in contrast, measures of the financial system no longer appear to matter as importantly, as if inefficiencies in banking and financial systems are no longer as binding a constraint as at earlier stages of financial development; nor are demographic variables as important as before. At this point, other variables gain a growing role: these include whether the country experiences a banking or currency crisis, the extent of non-foreign direct investment capital inflows, and government debt as a share of gross domestic product.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Asian Development Bank; Korea University,"Shin, K (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",Asian Development Bank,Asian Development Bank,This work was supported by the Asian Development Bank.,,23,3,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Wine politics show us that within market economies we find the same political movements. Markets, like politics, consist of institutions that differentially embed, codify and distribute power. In the case of France, small, individually weak wine producers became powerful in the aggregate; unified French grape growers came together to force a deal with the economically dominant wine merchants. Their joint political power was institutionalized in power-sharing, state-backed corporatist producer organizations. In contrast, small Italian producers failed to cooperate systematically and aggregate their power. Stronger organization enabled the construction of an institutional comparative advantage and higher prices for regulated French terroir wines. Economic sociologists claim markets are 'socially embedded'. This article demonstrates markets are 'politically embedded': French market dominance results from effective power sharing mechanisms across the supply chain.","[Carter, Elizabeth] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Carter, E (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",elizabeth.carter@unh.edu,"Carter, Elizabeth/GQQ-6738-2022; Carter, Elizabeth/AAP-6585-2020","Carter, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3014-7084; Carter, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3014-7084",,,,,33,13,14,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We provide what appears to be the first quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of at-scale drug provision in a poor country, using the phased rollout of ART in Zambia, a setting where approximately one in six adults are HIV positive. Combining anthropometric data from national household surveys and a spatially based triple-difference specification, we find that local ART introduction increased the weight of high HIV likelihood adult women. This finding from a clinically difficult setting suggests that the generalized challenges of scalability of ART for adult health in sub-Saharan Africa are surmountable.","[Lucas, Adrienne M.] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Lucas, Adrienne M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas L.] Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas L.] Off Evaluat Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA",University of Delaware; National Bureau of Economic Research; Reed College - Oregon,"Wilson, NL (通讯作者)，Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA.;Wilson, NL (通讯作者)，Off Evaluat Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",nwilson@reed.edu,,,NBER Africa,NBER Africa,"The NBER Africa Project provided generous financial and institutional support.

The framework can be used to validate cost-effectiveness endpoints generated from routine data sources when comparable data is available directly from trial case report forms or from another source. We illustrate application of the framework using data from a recent trial-based economic evaluation of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve strain BBG administered to babies less than 31 weeks of gestation. Cost-effectiveness endpoints are compared using two sources of information; trial case report forms and data extracted from the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), a clinical database created through collaborative efforts of UK neonatal services. Focusing on mean incremental net benefits at A 30,000 pound per episode of sepsis averted, the study revealed no evidence of discrepancy between the data sources (two-sided p values > 0.4), low probability estimates of miscoverage (ranging from 0.039 to 0.060) and concordance correlation coefficients greater than 0.86. We conclude that the NNRD could potentially serve as a reliable source of data for future trial-based economic evaluations of neonatal interventions.

In addition to questions of environmental suitability, the economic viability of Eucalyptus is a significant hurdle to widespread adoption for commercial plantings. We sought to assess the potential obtainable yields and economic feasibility of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex. Maiden and E. benthamii Maiden et Cambage, two species suitable for the southern United States. Using the process-based growth model 3PG, we projected potential yields at the sub-county level for E. grandis in Florida where it is operationally grown and E. benthamii in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 8a and 8b where it has shown tolerance to occasional low temperatures. The 3PG model estimated mean annual volume increment, inside bark (MAI) that was used to estimate land expectation value (LEV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The MAI of E. grandis ranged from 18 to 119 m(3) ha(-)1(y)ear(-1) (9 to 59.5 dry Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) with a mean of 42.6m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (20.8 dry Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) for sites in peninsular Florida. The lower growth projections came from north Florida areas where annual frosts occur. Excluding urban areas, the LEV of E. grandis ranged from $-1264 to $1710 ha(-1) with a mean of $424 ha(-1). The estimated IRR ranged from -9.7% to 16.9% with a mean of 8.2%. Eucalyptus benthamii MAI ranged from 3.3 to 76 m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (1.8 to 41.8 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)), with a mean of 21.9m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) (11.9 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)). The higher yields were primarily located in coastal regions of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b. Excluding urban areas, LEV ranged from $-2707 ha(-1) to $1532 ha(-1). The maximum estimated IRR was 15.9%. Our results show that Eucalyptus is potentially profitable as a bioenergy crop in the southern USA, but potential profitability of E. benthamii was limited by low temperature; positive LEV was obtained where productivity was 30m(3) ha(-1)year(-1) or more. Profitability was restricted to a small percentage (12%) of sites theoretically within the operational range in the southern U. S. indicating that a wholesale conversion of Pinus taeda plantations is unlikely.","[Stanturf, John A.] USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Young, Timothy M.; Huang, Xia] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville Ctr Renewable Carbon, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Perdue, James H.] USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Dougherty, Derek; Pigott, Michael] Dougherty & Dougherty Forestry Serv Inc, POB 82013, Athens, GA 30608 USA; [Guo, Zhimei] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 306A Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Stanturf, John A.] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Kreutwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Stanturf, JA (通讯作者)，USDA Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Stanturf, JA (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Kreutwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",johnalvin.stanurf@emu.ee; tmyoung1@utk.edu; jperdue@fs.fed.us; ddougherty@progressiveforestry.com; mpigott@progressivetiveforestry.com; zzg0001@auburn.edu,"Stanturf, John A./M-4171-2019; Young, Timothy M/D-9949-2011","Stanturf, John A./0000-0002-6828-9459; Young, Timothy M/0000-0001-9564-6506","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station [FS 07CR11330115087]; USDA McIntire-Stennis research project [TENOOMS-101]; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon; Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); USDA McIntire-Stennis research project; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon; Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","We thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions that improved our manuscript.

We focus on three aspects related to scheduling: student fatigue, time center dot of instruction, and instructor schedules. Data cover five academic years at the United States Air Force Academy, where schedules are randomized, grading is standardized, and there is substantial variance in schedule structure. Analyzing over 180,000 student-course outcomes, we find causal evidence of cognitive fatigue brought on by scheduling multiple courses in a row. The expected performance of two students in the same class may differ by as much as 0.15 standard deviations simply owing to their prior schedules. All else equal, students perform better in the afternoon than in the early morning. We also note that instruction improves with repetition. Heterogeneous effects by ability suggest that overall gains are possible. Prioritizing certain schedules would be equivalent to improving teacher quality by one-third of a standard deviation. A reorganization of students' daily school schedules is a promising and potentially low-cost educational intervention.","[Williams, Kevin M.] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA; [Shapiro, Teny Maghakian] Slack Res & Analyt, San Francisco, CA USA",Occidental College,"Williams, KM (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",KevinW@Oxy.edu; tshapiro@slack-corp.com,,,,,,,35,11,14,1,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

We find that teachers serving initially higher performing students have more precise value-added estimates and in most cases have higher year-to-year stability levels than teachers with lower performing students. We also decompose the variation in value-added estimates into components that reflect persistent and transitory variation in true teacher performance as well as variation caused by imprecision in the estimates. We find that teachers with lower performing students have less precision in their estimates and more transitory variation in value-added from year to year than other teachers. Our estimates imply that if teachers serving initially lower performing students had levels of precision and transitory variation in their value-added estimates equal to those serving higher performing students, the year-to-year stability in their estimates would actually exceed that of teachers with initially higher performing students.","[Stacy, Brian; Wooldridge, Jeffrey] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Guarino, Cassandra] Univ Calif Riverside, Grad Sch Educ, 2123 Sprout Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Stacy, B (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",brian.w.s-tacy@ers.usda.gov; cassandra.guarino@ucr.edu; wooldri1@msu.edu,"Stacy, Brian/O-4077-2019","Stacy, Brian/0000-0002-3039-2004; Guarino, Cassandra/0000-0002-9252-9678","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305D100028, R3058090011]","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education)","The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grants, R305D100028 and 83058090011 to Michigan State University.

In contrast, we ask whether taxes that penalize high emitters induce changes in the retirement of existing and inefficient vehicles. We exploit natural experiment conditions in Switzerland to analyze the impact of three different bonus/malus annual registration fee schemes implemented at the cantonal level. In the three schemes, the bonus rewards new, fuel-efficient vehicles. The malus is retroactive in canton Obwalden, i.e. it is charged on both new and existing high-emitting cars, but prospective in Geneva and Ticino. We use a difference-in-difference design within a survival analysis framework to assess direct treatment effects and spillover effects. While the bonus/malus in Obwalden hastens the retirement of existing high-emitting vehicles (by around 5%), the scheme in Geneva postpones retirement (by some 3%). We find no statistically significant effects in Ticino. These findings have important implications about the desirability of bonus/malus schemes and on their design, as well as on old car scrappage programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this first part, I derive the formulas for five types of forest property taxation under the generalized Faustmann formula. They are the unmodified property tax, the site value tax, the flat property tax, as well as the gross and net forest revenue productivity taxes. The impacts of these taxes in terms of fiscal neutrality and tax burden are then examined. Fiscal neutrality examines whether the imposition of a tax will affect management decisions. Tax burden measures the magnitude of the reduction in the value of the land, known as the site burden, and that of the forest as a whole, known as the forest burden, as a result of the imposition of a property tax on forestland of different productivities. Analytical results indicate that all forest property taxes are theoretically not fiscally neutral. They will all shorten the optimal harvest age. This is in sharp contrast to the results under the classic Faustmann formula under which the latter 4 types of taxes are all known to be fiscally neutral. In terms of tax burden, the unmodified property tax, the fiat property tax and the gross forest revenue productivity tax impose a heavier site burden on less productive land than on more productive land. The forest burden is age dependent. At age 0, all but the flat property tax imposes a lighter burden on less productive land. At the optimal harvest age, the unmodified property tax, the flat property tax and the gross forest revenue productivity tax impose a heavier burden on less productive land. The net forest revenue productivity tax imposes a heavier tax burden on the less productive land when the annual management cost is small. When the annual management cost is significant, the tax burden could become lighter on the less productive land. Only the site value tax imposes a lighter site and forest burden on the less productive land consistently.","[Chang, Sun Joseph] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Chang, SJ (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",xp2610@lsu.edu,,,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program [14-JV-11330143-102]; USDA Forest Service [14-JV-11330143-102]; Forest Service,McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program; USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Forest Service(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),Research supported in part by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative State Research Program and USDA Forest Service Joint Venture Agreement 14-JV-11330143-102.

We examine the impact of international child sponsorship on the psychology of Indonesian children by employing a novel program evaluation technique-a quantified analysis of children's self-portraits. To identify causal effects, we exploit an eligibility rule that established a maximum age for participation.

We link monthly data on search frequency in local Search Units to information on changes in local open enrollment options driven by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) sanctions as well as state school choice policies including open enrollment, tuition vouchers, charitable scholarship tax credits, and tuition tax credits. Our results indicate that NCLB-driven expansions in school choice have large, positive effects on the frequency of searches done for schools in that area. We find less evidence that state choice policies affect online search behavior, however search frequency also increases when charter school penetration in a given area rises. These estimates suggest that the information parents have about local schools is endogenous to the choice environment they face, and that parental information depends not just on the availability of data but also the incentive to seek and use it.","[Lovenheim, Michael F.] Cornell Univ, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lovenheim, Michael F.] NBER, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Walsh, Patrick] St Michaels Coll, Colchester, VT USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lovenheim, MF (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Lovenheim, MF (通讯作者)，NBER, 102 Martha Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mfl55@cornell.edu,"Lovenheim, Michael F/K-7260-2012",,Cornell Institute for Social Science; St. Michael's College,Cornell Institute for Social Science; St. Michael's College,"We gratefully acknowledge funding for this research from the Cornell Institute for Social Science and St. Michael's College.

We further find that gender norms shaped by beliefs on women's political empowerment and economic opportunity affect the gender gaps in test scores in general. Interestingly, gender norms do not seem to particularly influence math related stereotypes, but instead, preferences for math. Finally, the evidence indicates that these findings are driven by cognitive skills, suggesting that social gender norms affect parent's expectations on girls' academic knowledge relative to that of boys, but not on other attributes for success such as non-cognitive skills. Taken together, our results highlight the relevance of general (as opposed to math-specific) gender stereotypes on the math gender gap.","[Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ Dept, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA; [Nollenberger, Natalia] IE Univ, IE Business Sch, Segovia, Spain",City University of New York (CUNY) System; IE University,"Rodríguez-Planas, N (通讯作者)，CUNY Queens Coll, Econ Dept, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA.",nuria.Rodriguezplanas@qc.cuny.edu,"Rodriguez-Planaz, Nuria/AAF-6282-2021","Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria/0000-0003-3824-7001; Nollenberger, Natalia/0000-0001-7630-2679",PSC-CUNY Award - Professional Staff Congress [6080200 86]; City University of New York,PSC-CUNY Award - Professional Staff Congress; City University of New York,"We thank Editor Daniel Rees and two anonymous referees for excellent comments on two earlier versions of this paper.

Even holding land use constant, ecosystem service provision may change through time due to climate change. This paper develops an auction mechanism that implements an optimal solution for providing ecosystem services through time with multiple landowners who have private information about the net benefits of alternative uses of their land. Under the auction, each landowner has a dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their private information. With this information a regulator can then implement the optimal landscape pattern, which maximizes the present value of net benefits derived from the landscape, following the rules of the auction mechanism. The auction can be designed as a subsidy auction that pays landowners to conserve or a tax auction where landowners pay for the right to develop. Our mechanism optimizes social adaptation of ecosystem management to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the assault on the public sector,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,SUBPRIME MORTGAGE; AUSTERITY; POLITICS; CRISIS; RETRENCHMENT; REVENGE; SERVICE; GENDER; RISE; RACE,"This article explores the 'shrinking state', the potential erosion of the state from its customary intervention in regulating economic growth and promoting redistribution and the overall weakening of the state as an institution in local/regional affairs. State retreat may be seen in the withdrawal of finance, services and staff as well as the failure to increase these resources to match growing needs, both of which are referred to as 'retrenchment' or, in the European case, 'austerity'. The erosion of the state as an institution is visible in underfunded social programmes, a smaller public sector, weakened regulatory structures, foregone infrastructure projects, public assets sales and continued privatization. This article argues that the 'shrinking state' both produces and is a product of a restructured social contract between government and citizens and the private sector that has transformed regions and localities. Although we have not seen wholesale state decline, there have been gradations of state change, especially in qualitative markers such as shifts in state functions, scales of activity, constituencies served and private sector involvement in governmental affairs. These changes, in turn, have led to shifts in state capacity and policy orientation that leave populations bereft of needed public services, increased inequality across geographic areas and sociodemographic groups, and political effects such as the growth of right-wing populism.","[Lobao, Linda] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gray, Mia] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Cox, Kevin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kitson, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Cambridge,"Lobao, L (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lobao.1@osu.edu; Mia.Gray@geog.cam.ac.uk; cox.13@osu.edu; mk24@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,96,74,77,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the bonus policy increased the proportion of certified teachers in bonus-eligible schools by improving hiring, increasing certification rates of incumbent teachers, and reducing turnover. Depending on the method, we estimate that the proportion of NBCTs in treated schools increased by about four to eight percentage points over the first five years of eligibility. However, the improvement in certification rates corresponds to a change of about 0.2-0.3% of a standard deviation in teacher quality per year and we do not find evidence that the bonus resulted in detectible effects on student test achievement.","[Cowan, James; Goldhaber, Dan] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Goldhaber, Dan] Univ Washington, Ctr Educ Data & Res, 3876 Bridge Way N,Suite 201, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",American Institutes for Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Cowan, J (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.",jcowan@air.org,,"Goldhaber, Dan/0000-0003-4260-4040","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1088331]; National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305C120008]","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education","This study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, through grant #OPP1088331 to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and by the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER), funded through grant #R305C120008 to the American Institutes for Research from the Institutes of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education.

If resource users care about the welfare of others, they may be unwilling to respect property rights regimes that lead to unfair or inequitable outcomes. We explore in a series of laboratory experiments whether it is possible to undermine the efficacy of property rights solutions through the allocation process. We find that both the extent to which property rights are enforced and how they are allocated significantly affect extraction and compliance. Our findings suggest that one of the most popular allocation methods is suboptimal: we observe that occasional enforcement and the proportional allocation of property rights is dominated by no enforcement and the equal or inverse allocation of property rights. Our results support the view that allocation matters for property rights solutions to the commons problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In a model with rational and fully informed consumers, this question is straightforward. There is disagreement, however, about whether consumers are rational and fully informed, and the literature offers little practical guidance about what approach the FDA should use if they are not. In this paper, we outline the history of the FDA's recent attempts to regulate cigarettes and other tobacco products and how they have valued foregone consumer surplus in cost-benefit analyses. We advocate replacing the approach used in most of this literature, which first calculates health gains associated with regulation and then offsets them by some factor reflecting consumer surplus losses, with a more general behavioral public finance framework for welfare analysis. This framework applies standard tools of welfare analysis to consumer demand that may be biased (that is, not necessarily rational and fully informed) without requiring specific assumptions about the reason for the bias. This framework would require estimates of both biased and unbiased consumer demand; we sketch an agenda to help develop these in the context of smoking. The use of this framework would substantially reduce the confusion currently surrounding welfare analysis of tobacco regulation.","[Levy, Helen G.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levy, Helen G.; Norton, Edward C.; Smith, Jeffrey A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, NBER, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey A.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Levy, HG (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Levy, HG (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hlevy@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021; Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631;",NIH [5R03CA182990]; NIA [K01AG034232],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding for this project from NIH grant number 5R03CA182990 and, for Levy, from NIA grant number K01AG034232.

Systematic Evidence from Thousands of Innovations,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,health innovation; quality-adjusted prices,COST-EFFECTIVENESS,"Medical innovations have improved treatment for many diseases but have simultaneously raised spending on health care. Many health economists believe that technological change is the major factor driving the growth of the health-care sector. Whether quality has increased as much as spending-that is, whether new innovations raise or lower quality-adjusted prices in health care-is a central question for both positive and normative health-care analysis. We do a systematic analysis of the impact of technological change on quality-adjusted prices, with over 6,000 comparisons between innovations and incumbent technologies. We observe each innovation's price and quality, as well as the price and quality of an incumbent technology treating the same disease. We find that the innovations' quality-adjusted prices are higher than the incumbents' for about two-thirds of innovations. Nevertheless, we argue that quality-adjusted prices may fall or rise over time depending on the effect of competition on incumbents' prices over time. A 4-percent price decline due to competition would offset the cross-sectional price difference for a majority of indications.

We detect an inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and TFP and show that it primarily drives the temperature-output effect. Both labor- and capital-intensive firms exhibit sensitivity to high temperatures. By mid 21st century, if no additional adaptation were to occur, we project that climate change will reduce Chinese manufacturing output annually by 12%, equivalent to a loss of $39.5 billion in 2007 dollars. This implies substantial local and global economic consequences as the Chinese manufacturing sector produces 32% of national GDP and supplies 12% of global exports. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The question before the AB is whether the European Union complied with earlier rulings on its anti-dumping procedures. Broadly, the AB found that the EU had not, generally ruling in favor of the People's Republic of China. In the process, the AB raised interesting questions about what it means to be a Non-Market Economy (NME) in the WTO. While NME status has traditionally led to large dumping margins, the AB approach in this case may lessen the consequences for China. Among other things, the case raises the interesting and important question of how pervasive the taint of NME status may be when calculating margins. By allowing for adjustments of certain costs, the AB seems to constrain the more draconian analogue country methodology of calculation.","[Espa, Ilaria] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland; [Espa, Ilaria] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Levy, Philip I.] Chicago Council Global Affairs, Chicago, IL USA; [Levy, Philip I.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Bern; Northwestern University,"Espa, I (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.;Espa, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",ilaria.espa@wti.org; plevy@thechicagocouncil.org,,"Espa, Ilaria/0000-0002-6246-3137",,,,,6,5,5,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,313,334,,10.1017/S1474745617000593,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430704500007,0

Given that the exceptional method was the only method under which the AB had not definitively rejected zeroing, this dispute may have hammered the last nail in the coffin of zeroing. Or, maybe not. The AB did not address a key issue, namely: What is the evidentiary standard that an investigating authority must meet in order to have legitimate recourse to W-T? In addition, the AB's suggested approach to aggregating dumping amounts across targeted and non-targeted groups may produce zeroing-like outcomes even if the authority does not resort to zeroing. It seems inevitable that future disputes will be required to address these issues, since history shows that at least some investigating authorities are gearing towards using this methodology ad nauseam.

However, it is an imperfect substitute, since it reduces temperature without reducing atmospheric or ocean carbon concentrations. Carbon concentrations are higher but temperature is lower when allowing for solar geoengineering. Ignoring geoengineering in climate models can lead to welfare losses of up to 4 percent of GDP.

When a successful project has distinct private and public benefits, a publicly-funded subsidy may be warranted to induce a pilot project, a full project, or both. We draw on insights about the value of experimentation for entrepreneurship and raising private capital to derive insights about when subsidizing projects or pilots is more efficient.

This paper analyzes the spillover effects of charter schools on traditional public school (TPS) students in New York City. I exploit variation in both the timing of charter school entry and distance to the nearest charter school to obtain credibly causal estimates of the impacts of charter schools on TPS student performance, and I am among the first to estimate the impacts of charter school co-location. I further add to the literature by exploring potential mechanisms for these findings with school-level data on per pupil expenditures (PPE), and parent and teacher perceptions of schools. Briefly, I find charter schools significantly increase TPS student performance in both English Language Arts and math, and decrease the probability of grade retention. Effects increase with charter school proximity and are largest in TPSs co-located with charter schools. Potential explanations for improved performance include increased PPE, academic expectations, student engagement, and a more respectful and safe school environment after charter entry. The findings suggest that more charter schools in New York City may be beneficial at the margin, and co-location may be mutually beneficial for charter and traditional public schools.","[Cordes, Sarah A.] Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Cordes, SA (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Coll Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",sarah.cordes@temple.edu,,"Cordes, Sarah/0000-0003-4355-0806",Spencer Foundation [201100049],Spencer Foundation,"I thank Amy Ellen Schwartz, Leanna Stiefel, Ingrid Gould Ellen, Sean P.

Under the assumption of backward tax shifting, all of the taxes result in lower land expectation values. If the tax does not affect the optimal harvest age empirically, then the value of the standing timber remains the same with or without taxation.

While methods for establishing causal impacts are prevalent, less attention has been paid to explaining the mechanisms through which the causal relationship came to be. Understanding mechanisms is crucial for designing policies that foster the mechanisms that achieve the intended objectives of marine reserves and mitigate the mechanisms that do not. We estimate the treatment effect of a large marine reserve on the net earnings of a commercial fishery using difference-in-differences and synthetic-control designs, and decompose the treatment effect into its constituent mechanisms through structural equation modeling. We find minimal evidence that closing the marine reserve to fishing had a significant economic cost for the industry; however, several counteracting mechanisms are critical for explaining the effect and for generalizing to other settings.

The utility of each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) depends on location specific amenities, earnings opportunities, housing costs, and the cost of moving to the MSA from the household head's birthplace. We use the estimated trade-off among wages, housing costs, and climate amenities to value changes in mean winter and summer temperatures. We find that households sort among MSAs as a result of heterogeneous tastes for winter and summer temperatures. Preferences for winter and summer temperatures are negatively correlated: households that prefer milder winters, on average, prefer cooler summers, and households that prefer colder winters prefer warmer summers. Households in the Midwest region, on average, have lower marginal willingness to pay to increase winter and reduce summer temperatures than households in the Pacific and South Atlantic census divisions. We use our results to value changes in winter and summer temperatures for the period 2020 to 2050 under the B1 (climate-friendly) and A2 (more extreme) climate scenarios. On average, households are willing to pay 1 percent of income to avoid the B1 scenario and 2.4 percent of income to avoid the A2 scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Risk adjustment typically aims to predict annual costs of individuals enrolled in an insurance plan for a full year. However, partial-year enrollment is common and poses a challenge to risk adjustment, since diagnoses are observed with lower probability when an individual is observed for a shorter time. Because of missed diagnoses, risk-adjustment systems will underpay for partial-year enrollees, as compared with full-year enrollees with similar underlying health status and usage patterns. We derive a new adjustment for partial-year enrollment in which payments are scaled up for partial-year enrollees' observed diagnoses, which improves upon existing methods. We simulate the role of missed diagnoses using a sample of commercially insured individuals and the 2014 Marketplace risk-adjustment algorithm and find the expected spending of six-month enrollees is underpredicted by 19 percent. We then examine whether there are systematically different care usage patterns for partial-year enrollees in this data, which can offset or amplify underprediction due to missed diagnoses. Accounting for differential spending patterns of partial-year enrollees does not substantially change the underprediction for six-month enrollees. However, one-month enrollees use systematically less than one-twelfth the care of full-year enrollees, partially offsetting the missed-diagnosis effect.","[Ericson, Keith M.

Methods: Patients with an HCC diagnosis and one or more sorafenib prescription were identified from samples of > 3 million insured persons in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014 using the anonymised Betriebskrankenkasse health insurance scheme database. Incidence rates from 2013 were extrapolated to the German population using data from the statutory health insurance system database and Robert Koch Institute. Resource use and cost data were collected for a subset of patients with follow-up data post-sorafenib. Results: Between 1032 and 1484 patients with HCC in Germany (893-1390 publicly insured patients) were estimated as likely to be eligible for second-line therapy after sorafenib annually. For post-sorafenib analyses, 117 patients were identified with HCC, one or more sorafenib prescription and considered potentially eligible for second-line treatment, 15 of whom were alive after 12 months' follow-up. Total mean costs per patient accrued in the 12 months after sorafenib treatment ended were (sic)11,152 (hospital care, (sic)6483 [58.1%]; outpatient prescriptions, (sic)3137 [28.1%]). Conclusion: The estimated number of publicly insured HCC patients annually eligible for second-line therapy in Germany was < 1400 and mean total costs accrued in the year after completion of sorafenib therapy were approximately (sic)11,000 per patient for the German statutory healthcare system. These estimates can be used when evaluating the budgetary impact of new second-line therapies for advanced HCC in Germany.","[Clouth, Johannes] Lilly Deutschland GmbH, Med Affairs, Werner Reimers Str 2-4, D-61352 Bad Homburg, Germany; [Liepa, Astra M.] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Moeser, Guido] Masem Res Inst GmbH, Unter Eichen 5-G, D-65195 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Friedel, Heiko; Bernzen, Magdalena; Garal-Pantaler, Elena] Team Gesundheit GmbH, Rellinghauser Str 93, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Trojan, Joerg] Univ Klinikum Frankfurt, Med Klin 1, Theodor Stern Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany",Eli Lilly; Lilly Deutschland GmbH; Eli Lilly; Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt Hospital,"Clouth, J (通讯作者)，Lilly Deutschland GmbH, Med Affairs, Werner Reimers Str 2-4, D-61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.",johannes.clouth@gmx.de,,"Garal-Pantaler, Elena/0009-0005-5285-6913",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"This work was supported by Eli Lilly and Company, who played a role in the design of the study; collection, analysis and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.",,26,5,5,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

In Kenya, Croton megalocarpus (Croton) is a prolific and widely distributed tree with such potential being currently underutilized. In support of scaling up the promising Croton value chain in Kenya, a choice experiment was designed and conducted as part of a survey with 200 rural households in four counties in the Central region of the country. The objective was to assess household preferences in planting and cultivating Croton trees for collection and selling of seeds to a growing market. Attributes for the choice model production system included seedling cost, oilseed yield, tree maturation period, labour for seed collection, and seed selling price. Results show that almost all households have Croton trees on their land and are willing to produce Croton seeds, although dear tradeoffs among the attributes exist. Seed price is the most dominant single attribute cutting across all socio-demographic characteristics. Time and labour constraints were significant for some households: farmers are more averse to longer maturation periods than non-farmers, while those already collecting seeds for the nascent industry are less concerned about the opportunity costs of time and labour than non-collectors. The results provide guidance for the development of a Croton value chain which can have positive impacts on rural livelihoods in East Africa.","[Jacobson, Michael; Shr, Yau-Huo] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Dalemans, Floris] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Magaju, Christine; Ciannella, Rodrigo] World Agroforesuy Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; KU Leuven,"Jacobson, M (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mgj2@psu.edu,"Shr, Jimmy/JCO-6319-2023","Shr, Jimmy/0000-0001-6519-5396; Dalemans, Floris/0000-0002-5944-9254","World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops","World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops","This work was supported by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), through the Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops.",,51,8,8,4,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JAN,2018,86.0,,,,,,76,85,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.09.015,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR9VD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000419420300008,0

We document substantial variations in firms' capital structure adjustments across countries and, particularly, over time. Consistent with adjustment costs impeding firms from rebalancing their capital structures, worse market imperfections are associated with slower speeds of adjustment (SOA) and larger leverage deviations. Intertemporally, capital structure adjustment is procyclical, with SOA increasing by 0.9 percentage point for a one-percentage-point increase in GDP growth rate. The procyclicality is attributable to good macroeconomic conditions mitigating market imperfections through channels of 1) facilitating free-ride restructuring and 2) uncertainty alleviation.

Using the Minimum Data Set and the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting data from 2001 to 2009, we examine how the weights put on various performance measures that are tied to P4P bonuses, such as clinical outcomes, inspection deficiencies, and staffing levels, affect improvements in those measures. We find larger weights on clinical outcomes often lead to larger improvements, but small weights can lead to no improvement or worsening of some clinical outcomes. We find a qualifier for P4P eligibility based on having few or no severe inspection deficiencies is more effective at decreasing inspection deficiencies than using weights, suggesting simple rules for participation may incent larger improvement.","[Konetzka, R.

I describe at what point students send scores to colleges and which score sends ultimately become applications, resulting in three main points. First, score sends are not synonymous with applications-rather, only 62 percent of score sends in this sample turn into applications. Second, the conversion from score send to application is nonrandom as it relates to college characteristics: Score sends are more likely to convert into applications when they are to colleges with lower tuition, higher graduation rates, and relatively near a student's home. Third, the timing of score sends is related to the probability of its becoming an application, whereby score sends sent relatively early are least likely to become applications. These facts imply that there is room for improvement when modeling the application process and, in addition, the timing of an intervention or policy may be critical to its success.","[Smith, Jonathan] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Smith, J (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",jsmith500@gsu.edu,,,,,,,35,6,8,1,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

These null effects are found along both the extensive and intensive margins of earnings (although the estimates are not precise).

Our study examines the effects of one such statewide articulation and transfer policy, the Ohio transfer module (TM). This agreement is intended to allow individuals who successfully complete the TM at one institution to transfer all of these credits to a receiving institution. We find that students who complete the TM are more likely to transfer to a four-year institution and earn associate's degrees than observationally similar peers who did not complete a TM. We also find suggestive evidence that students who complete the TM are able to bring more credits with them when they transfer. However, students who complete the TM also take slightly longer to complete their bachelor's degrees. Thus, although the TM may improve the probability that students will transfer, it may be inefficient for students, leading them to spend more time enrolled in college. Moreover, because only a small number of students complete the TM, this policy may not be far-reaching enough to dramatically improve Ohio's community college transfer rate.","[Boatman, Angela; Soliz, Adela] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Organizat, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Boatman, A (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Organizat, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",angela.boatman@vanderbilt.edu; adela.r.soliz@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,52,15,22,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Brazil has taken several steps to reduce emissions associated with deforestation including the development of policies to promote and reward cattle ranching intensification. Intensification practices are hypothesized to reduce the conversion of tropical forests while simultaneously increasing the productivity of ranching on current pasture lands. This paper assesses the impact of intensification on the demand for productive land. A theoretical model of land use, which considers the degree of intensification in the estimation of the derived demand for pasture, is tested with data from small-scale landowners who operate dairy farms and calving operations in the greater Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondonia. Results suggest different trajectories for beef and dairy production. The intensification of cattle production exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the demand for productive land: first as farms become more intensive the demand for newly cleared land increases, but then decreases with further intensification. The results are different for dairy intensification, which is found to be correlated with reduced deforestation. Findings suggest that the reliance on policies that promote intensification can be a risky way of achieving climate change objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Due to oversubscription of business papers, the field of the paper is assigned quasi-randomly. We find that writing in economics raises the probability of majoring in economics by 2.7 percentage points. We show further that this effect varies across subfields: the effect is driven by assignment to topics less typical of the public's perception of the field of economics, suggesting students learn through exposure that the field is broader than they thought.","[Fricke, Hans] Stanford Univ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Grogger, Jeffrey] Univ Chicago, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Steinmayr, Andreas] Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Fricke, Hans; Grogger, Jeffrey; Steinmayr, Andreas] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Grogger, Jeffrey] NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Steinmayr, Andreas] IFW Kiel, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Stanford University; University of Chicago; University of Munich; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Fricke, H (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hfricke@stanford.edu; jgrogger@uchicago.edu; andreas.steinmayr@econ.lmu.de,"Steinmayr, Andreas/HLX-0802-2023; Steinmayr, Andreas/AAF-4741-2019","Steinmayr, Andreas/0000-0002-2491-5032",Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SGP1_155412]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CRC TRR 190]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SGP1_155412] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Andreas Steinmayr received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation through grant P2SGP1_155412 and from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through CRC TRR 190.,,31,19,25,4,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Positive effects were found for material wealth, the environment, military affairs (specifically nuclear disarmament), and space travel. Negative effects were found for military affairs (specifically rogue actor violence) and AI. The net effect for surveillance was ambiguous. The effects for the environment, military affairs, and AI appear to be the largest, with the environment perhaps being the largest of these, suggesting that APM would be net beneficial to society. However, these factors are not well quantified and no definitive conclusion can be made.

This method is routinely used in environmental economics to derive the economic valuation of environmental attributes such as air pollution and water quality. For example, the Ricardian approach is based on a hedonic regression of land values on historical climate variables. Forecasts of future climate can then be employed to estimate the future costs of climate change. We show that this approach is only valid if current land markets ignore climate forecasts. While this assumption was defensible decades ago (when this literature first emerged), it is reasonable to hypothesize that information on climate change is so pervasive today that markets may already price in expectations of future climate change. Indeed, we show empirically that agricultural land markets in the United States now capitalize expectations about future climate change.

We find that ignoring endogeneity leads to a systematic underestimation of the effect of nursing turnover on mortality and quality of care in a sample of California nursing homes. Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in nurse turnover results in a facility receiving 1.8 additional deficiencies per annual regulatory survey, reflecting a 16.5 percent increase. Not accounting for endogeneity of turnover leads to results that suggest only a 1 percent increase in deficiencies. We also find suggestive evidence that turnover results in lower quality in other dimensions and may increase mortality.","[Antwi, Yaa Akosa] Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Antwi, YA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",y.akosa.antwi@jhu.edu,,,Upjohn Institute; IUPUI School of Liberal Art Summer grant program,Upjohn Institute; IUPUI School of Liberal Art Summer grant program,We acknowledge generous funding from the Upjohn Institute's Early Career Research Grant and the IUPUI School of Liberal Art Summer grant program.,,54,63,79,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Recent research suggests that the nursing supply adjusts to macroeconomic conditions. However, prior work has failed to consider the effect of macroeconomic conditions on demand for nurses through the effect on revenues. We test how county-level unemployment rates affect direct-care staffing rates in nursing homes using California data. We exploit the wide variation in the unemployment rates across counties and over time in 2005-12. We also test whether there are heterogeneous effects of unemployment rates by facility size, staffing level, and profit status. We find that as unemployment rates increase, staffing by registered nurses (RNs) decreases but staffing by licensed practical nurses (LPNs) increases. The increase in LPNs is larger in large nursing homes, nursing homes with higher staffing levels, and in for-profit nursing homes. We also find that as unemployment rates increase, nursing home revenue decreases. While the effect of macroeconomic conditions on nursing supply may be important for cost and quality of care, the mechanism is not simple, direct, or homogeneous for all types of nurses and nursing homes.","[Konetzka, R.

This paper addresses the need to identify the evidence on the economic impact of patient navigation in colorectal cancer, following the Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines. Articles indexed in Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science between January 2000 and March 2017 were analyzed. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality assessment of the included studies was based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Inclusion criteria indicated that the paper's subject had to explicitly address patient navigation in colorectal cancer and the study had to be an economic evaluation. The search yielded 243 papers, (of which were finally included within this review. Seven out of the nine studies included met standards for high-quality based on CHEERS criteria. Eight concluded that patient navigation programs were unequivocally cost-effective for the health outcomes of interest. Six studies were cost-effectiveness analyses. All studies computed the direct costs of the program, which were defined a minima as the program costs. Eight of the reviewed studies adopted the healthcare system perspective. Direct medical costs were usually divided into outpatient and inpatient visits, tests, and diagnostics. Effectiveness outcomes were mainly assessed through screening adherence, quality of life and time to diagnostic resolution. Given these outcomes, more economic research is needed for patient navigation during cancer treatment and survivorship as well as for patient navigation for other cancer types so that decision makers better understand costs and benefits for heterogeneous patient navigation programs.","[Gerves-Pinquie, Chloe] Res Inst Environm & Occupat Hlth Irset, Inserm UMR1085, Ester Team, UFR Sante,Dept Med, Rue Haute Reculee, F-49045 Angers 01, France; [Girault, Anne] French Sch Publ Hlth, EA MOS 7348, 20 Ave George Sand, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Phillips, Serena; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi] George Washington Univ, Ctr Canc, Inst Patient Ctr Initiat & Hlth Equ, 2600 Virginia Ave NW,Suite 300, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Raskin, Sarah] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L Douglas Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Scherer Hall,313923 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); George Washington University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Gervès-Pinquié, C (通讯作者)，Res Inst Environm & Occupat Hlth Irset, Inserm UMR1085, Ester Team, UFR Sante,Dept Med, Rue Haute Reculee, F-49045 Angers 01, France.",chloegerves@gmail.com,"Raskin, Sarah/AAC-2435-2022; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi/AAF-1815-2020","Raskin, Sarah/0000-0002-1652-6678; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi/0000-0002-9303-7659; Gerves-Pinquie, Chloe/0000-0002-2719-9801; Girault, Anne/0000-0002-5951-3279",,,,,36,22,24,1,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

In this case, the EU made adjustments to the price of biodiesel's principal input - soybeans - in determining the cost of production of biodiesel in Argentina. The adjustment was made based on the uncontested finding that the price of soybeans in Argentina was distorted by the existence of an export tax scheme that resulted in artificially low soybean prices. The Appellate Body found that the EU was not permitted to take tax policy-induced price distortions into account in calculating dumping margins. We analyze the economic rationale for Argentina's export tax system, distortions in biodiesel markets in Argentina and the EU, and the remaining trade policy options for addressing distorted international prices. We also assess whether existing subsidies disciplines would be more effective in addressing this problem and conclude that they would not.","[Crowley, Meredith A.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Crowley, Meredith A.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Hillman, Jennifer A.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC USA",University of Cambridge; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Georgetown University,"Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.;Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",meredith.crowley@econ.cam.ac.uk; jennifer.hillman@law.georgetown.edu,,"Crowley, Meredith A./0000-0003-2864-4580",,,,,11,11,11,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,195,213,,10.1017/S1474745617000581,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000430704500002,0

Overall, reduced care services have created care deficits for disadvantaged groups, including low-income rural elderly and children. The shifted care burden has also limited women's ability to participate fully in the market economy and has contributed to rising gender inequalities in labor force participation, off-farm employment, earnings, pensions, and mental health outcomes.","[Connelly, Rachel] Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Jacobsen, Joyce] Wesleyan Univ Econ, Publ Affairs Ctr, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Winnipeg; Peking University,"Connelly, R (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",e-connelly@bowdoin.edu; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; jjacobsen@wesleyan.edu; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada [107579]; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,"The studies in this volume were performed with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada (Project no. 107579).

We report two major results. First, emerging and developing economies built fiscal space in the run-up to the Great Recession of 2008-2009, which was then used for stimulus. Since then, fiscal space has shrunk and remains narrow as these economies have taken advantage of historically low interest rates. Second, fiscal policy in emerging and developing economies has become countercyclical (or less procyclical), i.e., graduated, since the 1980s, as most clearly demonstrated during the Great Recession. The move towards graduation is most pronounced for those economies with greater fiscal space, which suggests that fiscal space matters for a government's ability to implement countercyclical fiscal policy.","[Huidrom, Raju; Kose, M.

A portion of these reductions are based on expected sequestration and storage contributions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Significant uncertainty exists in future forest markets and thus the potential LULUCF contribution to US GHG reduction goals. This study seeks to inform the discussion by modeling US forest GHG accounts per different simulated demand scenarios across a grid of over 130,000 USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forestland plots over the conterminous United States. This spatially disaggregated future supply is based on empirical yield functions for log volume, biomass and carbon. Demand data is based on a spatial database of over 2300 forest product manufacturing facilities representing 11 intermediate and 13 final solid and pulpwood products. Transportation costs are derived from fuel prices and the locations of FIA plot from which a log is harvested and mill or port destination. Trade between mills in intermediate products such as sawmill residues or planer shavings is also captured within the model formulation. The resulting partial spatial equilibrium model of the US forest sector is solved annually for the period 2015-2035 with demand shifted by energy prices and macroeconomic indicators from the US EIA's Annual Energy Outlook for a Reference, Low Economic Growth, and High Economic Growth case. For each macroeconomic scenario simulated, figures showing historic and scenario-specific live tree camon emissions and sequestration are generated. Maps of the spatial allocation of both forest harvesting and related carbon fluxes are presented at the National level and detail is given for both regions and ownerships.","[Latta, Gregory S.] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Baker, Justin S.] RTI Int, Raleigh, NC USA; [Ohrel, Sara] US Environm Protect Agcy, Washington, DC USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Research Triangle Institute; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Latta, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",greg.latta@oregonstate.edu,,"Baker, Justin/0000-0002-9914-8421",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,31,26,27,2,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,35,48,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.003,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,32280299.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000423640000004,0

Studies of wage determination with worker and firm fixed effects typically find that firm-specific premiums explain 20% of overall wage variation. To interpret these findings, we develop a model of wage setting in which workers have idiosyncratic tastes for different workplaces.

The particular organization of these programs has consequences for public health, social justice, and ecological sustainability. This contribution draws on political economy, critical food studies, and feminist economics to analyze the US National School Lunch Program, one of the world's oldest and largest government-sponsored school lunch programs. It makes visible the social and environmental costs of the heat-and-serve economy, where widely used metrics consider only the speed and volume of service as productive work. This study demonstrates that such a narrow understanding of the labor of lunch devalues care and undercuts the potential for school food provisioning to promote ecological and feminist goals. Further, it proposes a high road alternative and outlines an agenda for reorganizing school food provisioning to maximize care in all its dimensions.","[Gaddis, Jennifer] Univ Wisconsin, Civil Soc & Community Studies, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Coplen, Amy K.] Portland State Univ, Coll Urban & Publ Affairs Urban Studies & Plannin, 506 SW Mill St, Portland, OR 97207 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Portland State University,"Gaddis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Civil Soc & Community Studies, 1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jgaddis@wisc.edu; akcoplen@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation [1256925]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1256925] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank all the foodservice professionals engaged in the work of feeding children at school, as well as the many activists who are fighting for a just and sustainable food system.

Building on the world polity literature, I hypothesize that opinions about Western actors affect opinions about the influence of NGOs because NGOs can act as vehicles for the diffusion of Western culture. Using Pew Research survey data, I find that the more unfavorable respondents' opinions are of the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations, the more likely they are to believe that NGOs have a bad influence on their country. While previous research finds evidence that a mechanism of guilt by association exists between opinions about states and opinions about IGOs (Johnson, The Review of International Organizations, 6, 57-84, 2011), this manuscript expands on these findings by investigating the relationship between opinions about states and opinions about NGOs. This research has important implications for NGO effectiveness because opinions about NGOs can affect the willingness of local populations to work with such organizations.","[Guarrieri, Thomas R.] Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Profess Bldg,909 Univ Ave, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Guarrieri, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Polit Sci, Profess Bldg,909 Univ Ave, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tguarrieri@mizzou.edu,,,,,,,62,5,7,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

A central issue in ridesharing, which is also important in the general domain of cost-sharing in economics and computer science, is that the sharing of cost implies positive externalities and hence coordination problems for the network users. We investigate these problems experimentally in the present study. In particular, we focus on how sequential observability of transportation mode choices can be a powerful facilitator of coordination in ridesharing. Our study abstracts the essential issues of coordination in ridesharing into a directed network game with experimentally testable predictions. In line with the theoretical analysis, our experimental evidence shows that even a limited extent of sequential choice observability might lead to efficient coordination. However, convergence to efficiency is slower with more limited observability, resulting in a significant increase in travel cost.","[Mak, Vincent] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Seale, Darryl A.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Box 456001,4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Gisches, Eyran J.; Rapoport, Amnon] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Cheng, Meng; Moon, Myounghee; Yang, Rui] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Cambridge; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gisches, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",eyran@email.arizona.edu; amnon@email.arizona.edu,,,NSF [SES-1418923]; University of Arizona,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Arizona,"This research was supported by NSF Grant SES-1418923 awarded to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and University of Arizona.",,37,3,4,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,407,433,,10.1007/s11238-018-9663-y,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000448446600008,0

In particular, cycling is more likely and more severely to be affected by inclement weather than the motorized modes as the cyclists are entirely exposed to outdoor environment. Understanding the weather-cycling relationship is of great importance to academics and practitioners for cycling activity analysis and promotion. This study contributes to an in-depth understanding of how the changes in weather conditions affect cycling on an off-road trail and an on-road (bridge) bike lane at both daily and hourly scales across four seasons. The paper compares the weather-cycling relationship based on day of week and time of day combinations. The autocorrelation effect of cycling itself and the lagging effect of weather elements are also examined. The findings indicate that cycling is significantly self-dependent especially at the finer temporal scales. Weather have a very different influence on bicycle usage of off-road trails versus on-road bike lanes. When it rains its negative impact not only continues but also significantly affects the cycling within previous one hour. At the daily level, weekend cycling on the trail is less likely to be affected by weather as compared to cycling on the bike lane, whilst inverse is true for weekday cycling. Cycling is most likely to be affected by weather conditions in spring and least likely to be affected in winter. Cycling pattern which is more unrelated to weather at the aggregated level tends to be more flexibly adjusted according to the real-time weather conditions at the disaggregated level. Cyclists on weekends especially during the weekend peak hours (11 AM-4 PM) tend to have more flexibility to adjust their cycling schedule before or after the adverse weather conditions than on weekdays. In addition, cyclists with utilitarian purposes are more likely to shift from cycling to other modes (e.g., transit) due to real-time bad weather conditions in weekdays than in weekends, especially during weekday peak hours (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM). The results provide weather officials, transport agencies and research institutions with valuable information for cycling activity analysis and promotion by considering the effects of weather events especially rainfall.","[Zhao, Jinbao; Xing, Zhaomin] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jinbao; Luan, Xin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Purdue Univ, NEXTRANS Ctr, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 3000 Kent Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Jiang, Yang] China Sustainable Transportat Ctr, 19 Jianguomenwai Ave, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Southeast University - China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, 266 West Xincun Rd, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.;Zhao, JB (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Sipailou Rd, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinbao@sdut.edu.cn,"Wang, Jian/U-3959-2019; Wang, Jian/HII-8685-2022","Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645; Wang, Jian/0000-0002-0385-3645","National Science Foundation of China [51608313, 51508315]; Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology [2017ZBXC015]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology,"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (51608313, 51508315) and the Research Foundation of Shandong University of Technology (2017ZBXC015).

This article explores the distributive consequences of that strategy in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain. We argue that standard measures of poverty do not capture the deterioration in living standards as fully as anchored poverty. Moreover, we show that inequality trends conceal considerable re-ranking within the income distribution: those who were rich in 2012 had got richer in 2009-12, but those who were rich in 2009 lost ground in 2009-12. We find that in all four countries the new poor include significantly fewer pensioners and more unemployed workers, and are considerably poorer than the old poor had been. We demonstrate that there was significant variation in the magnitude and design of austerity, with Italy imposing a far smaller adjustment than Spain, and Portugal achieving less inequality in spite of robust fiscal consolidation. Nevertheless, even when austerity measures were designed to reduce inequality by compressing incomes downward, their second-order macro-economic effects ultimately increased inequality (except in Portugal). In the last section, we explore the political reasons for this variation.","[Perez, Sofia A.] Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matsaganis, Manos] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",Boston University; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Perez, SA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",sperez@bu.edu,"Perez, Sofia/GZL-4323-2022","Perez, Sofia/0000-0002-3294-9662; MATSAGANIS, EMMANUEL/0000-0002-0369-6280",Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project - European Research Council [340534]; European Research Council (ERC) [340534] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project - European Research Council; European Research Council (ERC),"Manos Matsaganis would like to acknowledge financial support under the Reconciling Economic and Social Europe project (www.resceu.eu), funded by the European Research Council (Advanced Grant no. 340534).",,63,79,84,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using a unique dataset that covers the universe of tendering prices submitted by all developers for all residential land auction sales in Singapore, we find that a tenderer's bids are significantly higher where there was a previous land parcel sold within two years and located within four kilometers. The identified price margin decreases with time and geographic distance. Tracking sequential bids submitted by the same developer over time, we find that the incumbent winner of a previous auction is more likely to participate in subsequent nearby land sales as compared to the second-highest bidder of the same auction. However, it does not necessarily win the subsequent sites.

We measure the latter using the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) and consider only policy conditions targeted at improvements in those areas. Using a comprehensive country-year panel data set of aid-receiving countries, we find a significant concave effect of public-sector conditions on the quality of PSG. These findings are robust to the use of alternative measures of PSG and to lagging the variable of interest by 4 periods. Further evidence is provided by employing sample restrictions, adding more controls, and estimating a dynamic model with generalized method of moments (difference GMM). The optimal number of conditions estimated by our preferred GMM specification is 107, where the predicted policy score is about 0.96 points (1.33 SD) higher than with zero conditions. We show that conditions related to public financial management are more effective than those related to anticorruption or civil service and administrative reform, where progress requires changing the behavior of a larger set of deconcentrated actors. We also find evidence that the impact of PSG lending is larger in democracies than in nondemocracies.

These contract-free jobs pay lower hourly wages, require longer weekly work hours, and provide less insurance or on-the-job training than regular jobs with contracts. We find that the co-villager networks play an important role in a migrant's decision on whether to accept such insecure and irregular jobs. By employing a comprehensive nationwide survey in 2011 in the spatial autoregressive logit model, we show that the common behavior of not signing contracts in the co-villager network increases the probability that a migrant accepts a contract-free job. We provide three possible explanations on how networks influence migrants' contract decisions: job referral mechanism, limited information on contract benefits, and the mini-labor union formed among co-villagers, which substitutes for a formal contract. In the subsample analysis, we also find that the effects are larger for migrants whose jobs were introduced by their co-villagers, male migrants, migrants with rural Hukou, short-term migrants, and less educated migrants.

The community-based model developed by Haiti Outreach (HO) trains communities to operate and maintain wells and has clear efficiency gains over the status quo aid model in Haiti that gives communities wells: HO's wells were 8.7 percentage points more likely to be functioning after one year than similarly-constructed wells managed under the status quo model. Because HO's model includes user fees, which raise concerns about equity, I quantify the equity-efficiency tradeoff posed by community-based and aid interventions by determining the preferences of a social planner indifferent between these types of water infrastructure interventions. Since HO's user fees are only 0.6 percent of median income in rural Haiti, under most specifications the efficiency gains of the community-based model outweigh the equity concerns addressed by the aid model.","[Aliprantis, Dionissi] Interuniv Inst Res & Dev INURED, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Aliprantis, Dionissi] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Aliprantis, D (通讯作者)，Interuniv Inst Res & Dev INURED, Port Au Prince, Haiti.;Aliprantis, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",dionissi.aliprantis@gmail.com,,,Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight [A0009778-001],Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight,"This work was supported by the Inter-American Development Bank's Office of Evaluation and Oversight [grant number A0009778-001] while the author was on unpaid leave from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Monetary policy can deviate from active inflation stabilization, and agents conduct Bayesian learning about the nature of these deviations. Under constrained discretion, only short deviations occur, agents' uncertainty about the macroeconomy remains contained, and welfare is high. However, if a deviation persists, uncertainty eventually accelerates and welfare declines. Announcing that inflation stabilization will be temporarily abandoned raises uncertainty. However, these announcements lower policy uncertainty and curb inflationary beliefs at the end of the policy.

Evidence from UK Twins,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; Obesity; Gene-environment interactions; Twins,BODY-MASS; DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY; BIRTH-WEIGHT; ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; STRATIFICATION; INHERITANCE; ATTAINMENT; SMOKING; US,"More education is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and likelihood of being obese. Obesity and BMI also have a strong genetic basis. Given these observations, we investigate whether more education can reduce obesity by attenuating the underlying genetic risk of being obese, through gene environment (GxE) interactions. We estimate associations between (i) education, (ii) a genetic risk score (GRS) and (iii) GxE interactions between education and the GRS through Ordinary least Squares (OLS) and twins fixed-effect regressions using data on female twins from the TwinsUK database. OLS estimates show that there are significant associations of education and genetics. Female twins with a university education are 14.3 percentage points less likely to be obese compared to twins with less than compulsory education, and a 1 standard deviation increase in the GRS increases the likelihood of being obese by 5.2 percentage points. The GxE interactions are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the marginal association of the GRS with obesity does not differ by educational attainment. When controlling for confounding through twins fixed-effects, we find a smaller role of genetics. The association of the GRS with obesity decreases to 0.040. Associations of educational attainment are substantially reduced and insignificant. GxE interactions also remain insignificant. Overall, we find little evidence of any GxE interactions.

One exception is a recent economics literature using the notion of incomplete markets to estimate the impacts of cattle ownership on children's milk consumption and growth outcomes in Eastern Africa. In addition to external validity concerns, an obvious internal validity concern is that dairy producers may systematically differ from non-dairy households, particularly in terms of latent wealth or nutritional knowledge. We re-examine these concerns by applying a novel double difference model to data from rural Bangladesh, a country with relatively low levels of milk consumption and high rates of stunting. We exploit the fact that a cow's lactation cycles provide an exogenous source of variation in household milk supply, which allows us to distinguish between a control group of households that do not own cows, a treatment group that own cows that have produced milk, and a placebo group of cow owning households that have not produced milk in the past 12 months. We find that household dairy production increases height-for-age Z scores by 0.52 standard deviations in the critical 6-23 month growth window, though in the first year of life we find that household dairy supply is associated with a 21.7 point decline in the rate of breastfeeding. The results therefore suggest that increasing access to dairy products can be extremely beneficial to children's nutrition, but may need to be accompanied by efforts to improve nutritional knowledge and appropriate breastfeeding practices.

They may be displaced sooner if they are taxed to internalize negative externalities. Currently, wind generation or nuclear power, supplemented by bulk electricity storage, are the most feasible alternatives to fossil fuels for electricity generation. The ERCOT ISO in Texas provides a realistic model for examining the costs of replacing fossil fuels by wind generation and storage, and for comparing wind power with generation based on nuclear and storage.

Economists are split as to whether it reflects the advent of jobless recoveries or just reflects slow recoveries in which both output and employment are slow to recover. We estimate a version of Friedman's plucking model to investigate this issue. We find evidence suggesting that employment does have its own dynamic response after a recession. Some of the slow growth in employment can be ascribed to the slow output growth, but there is a remaining portion which is consistent with the jobless recovery hypothesis. We then produce evidence relative to four different hypothesis of why jobless recoveries have occurred.","[Bradley, Michael D.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",George Washington University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Bradley, MD (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mdbrad@gwu.edu,,,Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A20444],Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The authors thank Neil Ericsson, Tara Sinclair and participants at the Southern Economic Association Meetings and the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics Symposium for helpful comments.

A large threshold effect leads to a poor approximation of the profile likelihood in finite samples such that the conventional approach to constructing confidence intervals excludes the true threshold parameter value too often, resulting in low coverage rates. We propose a conservative modification to the standard likelihood-ratio-based confidence interval that has coverage rates at least as high as the nominal level, while still being informative in the sense of including relatively few observations of the threshold variable. An application to thresholds for US industrial production growth at a disaggregated level shows the empirical relevance of applying the proposed approach.","[Donayre, Luiggi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Eo, Yunjong] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Morley, James] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Donayre, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",adonayre@d.umn.edu,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012; Eo, Yunjong/J-4319-2012","Eo, Yunjong/0000-0002-9172-2265; Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,15,4,4,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Usually real-world mechanisms are noisy and imprecise, that is, which we call 'fuzzy'. We therefore conducted a novel type of voluntary contributions experiment where we test a mechanism by varying its fuzziness. We focus on a range of fuzzy mechanisms we call 'meritocratic matching'. These mechanisms generalize the mechanism of 'contribution-based competitive grouping', and their basic function is to group players based on their contribution choices-i.e. high contributors with high contributors, and low contributors with low contributors. Theory predicts the following efficiency-equality tradeoff as a function of the mechanism's inherent fuzziness: high levels of fuzziness should lead to maximal inefficiency, but perfect equality; decreasing fuzziness is predicted to improve efficiency, but at the cost of growing inequality. The main finding of our experimental investigation is that, contrary to tradeoff predictions, less fuzziness increases both efficiency and equality. In fact, these unambiguous welfare gains are partially realized already at levels where the mechanism is too fuzzy for any high-efficiency outcome to even be a Nash equilibrium.","[Nax, Heinrich H.; Helbing, Dirk] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Balietti, Stefano] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Balietti, Stefano] Harvard Inst Quantitat Social Sci IQSS, Cambridge, MA USA; [Balietti, Stefano] Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Murphy, Ryan O.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; University of Zurich,"Nax, HH (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",hnax@ethz.ch; s.balietti@neu.edu,,/0000-0003-1261-8134,European Commission through ERC [324247],European Commission through ERC,"HHN and SB contributed equally to the manuscript overall.

First, we attempt to map the ways in which debt has been moving from sector to sector and from one group of countries to another within the global economy. By capturing this intersectorial, international, inter-regional movements of global debt, we aspire to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of global debt and its mode of operation. Second, we attempt to analyse what is wrong with global debt dynamics, that is, we examine the broken link between what global debt was supposed to do and what it does. Here, we point to three interrelated dynamics: the accumulation of unproductive debt, growing inequalities of income and wealth and the increase in privately created, interest-bearing money.

Analyzing geo-enriched data on nearly 4,800 hotel transactions in the United States, we find that the relative positioning of an asset's attributes - particularly at the extremes - has a significant impact on transaction prices. We also detect separating equilibria for extreme attributes across the premium and discount hotel segments. Extreme attributes stand out and are value enhancing in premium hotel segments. In contrast, extreme attributes are value diminishing in the discount hotel segment. The relative degree to which the asset's attributes are extreme is important. Being a locally largest asset has a negative effect on price, however the negative effect is more than offset if the hotel is among the largest hotels nationally. The results suggest that locally extreme assets, unless also nationally extreme, are considered atypical and trade at a discount.","[Das, Prashant] Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Smith, Patrick] San Diego State Univ, Fowler Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Gallimore, Paul] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Reading,"Das, P (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland.",prashant.das@ehl.ch; patrick.smith@sdsu.edu; p.gallimore@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Das, Prashant/0000-0002-3628-7213",,,,,55,7,9,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The pattern of results is consistent with positive income effects on births but no associated increase in marriage.

This study measures the influence of incubator quality and regional capacity variables on incubation outcomes using survey data from program managers across the United States. Results suggest that incubator quality variables have a stronger causal influence on successful incubation outcomes than regional capacity variables. While regional capacity is a stronger predictor for graduate-firm outcomes than for tenant-firm outcomes, incubator quality matters more overall. Results suggest that quality incubation may compensate for deficiencies in regional innovative capacity, which is often associated with entrepreneurial success. This research is expected to help policy makers more effectively use business incubators to hatch innovation-based entrepreneurial development.","[Harper-Anderson, Elsie] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L Douglas Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, Richmond, VA USA; [Lewis, David A.] SUNY Albany, Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Harper-Anderson, E (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, 923 West Franklin St,Box 842028, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",elharperande@vcu.edu,,"Harper-Anderson, Elsie/0000-0001-8182-0366",U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration,U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration.",,76,27,39,2,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The by-production approach models these technologies as intersections of two independent sub-technologies reflecting (1) the relations between goods in intended-output production designed by human engineers and (2) the emission-generating mechanism of nature governed by material-balance considerations. The axiomatic approach proposes a set of axioms that a pollution-generating technology should satisfy. We show that the by-production technology satisfies these axioms and that, conversely, any technology satisfying the axioms can be decomposed into two sub-technologies satisfying the by-production properties. In either approach, the technology can be functionally represented by two radial distance functions with well-defined properties. These distance functions can also serve as measures of technological and environmental efficiency. We exploit the link between the by-production and axiomatic approaches to offer preliminary suggestions about suitable functional forms for the empirical estimation of the two distance functions.","[Murty, Sushama] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Murty, Sushama] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India; [Russell, R.

I apply the method in the PNAD, a nationwide representative Brazilian cross-sectional dataset for the years 2001-2009. The results indicate that the size of the informal sector is increased by around 39% compared to what would prevail in the absence of the minimum wage, an effect attributable to (i) unemployment effects of the minimum wage on the formal sector and (ii) movements of workers from the formal to the informal sector as a response to the policy.","[Jales, Hugo] Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Jales, Hugo] Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY USA",,"Jales, H (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13202 USA.",hbjales@syr.edu,,,,,,,14,18,24,3,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

I combine annual data from the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and the Anglo African Trade Statistics to estimate a Vector Error Correction Model of the 18th century British slave trade that captures four versions of the Gun-Slave Hypothesis: guns-for-slaves-in-exchange, guns-for-slaves-in-production, slaves-for-guns-derived and the gun-slave cycle. Three econometric results emerge. (1) Gunpowder imports and slave exports were co-integrated in a long-run equilibrium relationship. (2) Positive deviations from equilibrium gunpowder produced additional slave exports. This guns-for-slaves-in-production result survives 17 placebo tests that replace gunpowder with non-lethal commodities imports. It is also confirmed by an instrumental variables estimation that uses excess capacity in the British gunpowder industry as an instrument for gunpowder. (3) Additional slave exports attracted additional gunpowder imports for 2-3 more years. Together these dynamics formed a gun-slave cycle. Impulse-response functions generate large increases in slave export in response to increases in gunpowder imports. I use these results to explain the growth of slave exports along the Guinea Coast of Africa in the 18th century. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, causal interpretation of estimates from previous studies, comparing participants to non-participants, is complicated by endogeneity and possible misreporting of participation in SNAP. In this paper, we take a novel approach to examine quasi-experimental variation in SNAP benefit amount on adult obesity. Children of SNAP households qualify for free in-school meals, thus freeing some additional benefits for the household. A greater proportion of school-age children eligible for free in-school meals proxies for an exogenous increase in the amount of SNAP benefits available per adult. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 we show that school meals represent a non-trivial part of the food budget for SNAP households. We find that increases in SNAP benefits have no effect on obesity levels for the full sample of those who report SNAP participation. To better isolate the effects of additional benefits from other potential changes we restrict our analysis to adults living in households with at least one child under 5 years of age. In this setting, we find that additional SNAP benefits reduce BMI and the probability of being obese for SNAP adults. Specifically, when one child in a household of four becomes school-aged, adult BMI is expected to decrease by 0.23 units and the probability of being obese decreases by 2.58 percentage points or by about 10%.

Using a structural new economic geography approach, we find that these policies have shaped regional economic development and urbanization patterns across China in very different ways. The construction of the NEN has reinforced China's existing core-periphery patterns: initially lagging regions not connected to the NEN have not benefitted much from its construction. By contrast, a removal of the Hukou restrictions is predicted to result in much more widespread welfare gains, allowing all people to benefit by moving to where they are most productive. Interestingly, it would even promote urbanization in currently lagging (inland) regions, mostly by stimulating rural outmigration.","[Bosker, Maarten] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] CEPR, London, England; [Deichmann, Uwe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Roberts, Mark] World Bank, Social Urban Rural & Resilience Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bosker@ese.eur.nl; udeichmann@worldbank.org; mroberts1@worldbank.org,"Roberts, Mark/HSG-3436-2023",,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,"The authors thank the editor and three anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that significantly improved earlier versions of the paper.

Furthermore, we consider a semiparametric estimator of binary response panel data models with sample selection that is robust to a variety of error distributions.

We offer two stylized facts for explanation: Leader change leads to dispute onset, and the effect is greater in autocracies than in democracies. We develop a model that explains changes in trade policy and dispute onset induced by shifts in the sectors represented in government when leaders change. Democracies protect a wider set of industries at shallower levels than do autocracies. When leaders change in autocracies, new sectors enter the winning coalition, resulting in new deeper barriers that spark disputes. When leaders change in democracies, the change in the winning coalition is not as stark, and the depth of the shifts in trade barriers is not that large, resulting is a smaller effect on dispute initiation.","[Rosendorff, B.

Using a geographically referenced dataset on new housing developments, this paper estimates how households value accessibility in Mexico City. Results are shown considering road accessibility to formal employment subcenters (private accessibility) and distance to the main public transport stations in the city (public accessibility). Results suggest that accessibility to employment subcenters is valued as an amenity by households but being closer to a Metro station is perceived as a disamenity. Moreover, households located in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of informal workers and with lower education levels give a lower value to private accessibility than households located in neighborhoods with a lower proportion of informal workers or in high-educated neighborhoods. These results are evidence of the existence of spatial segregation in the city where disadvantaged households are segregated, not only because of their economic conditions, but because they are located farther away from employment opportunities. The results in this work stress the importance of thinking about integrated land use and transport policies.","[Atuesta, Laura H.] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ CONACYT, Calle Circuito Tecnopolo 117, Aguascalientes 20313, Mexico; [Ibarra-Olivo, J.

Under what conditions do WTO members change domestic policies or measures that are challenged in WTO litigation? Starting from the assumption that policymakers are political-support maximizers who seek to avoid the mobilization of political enemies, we argue that the degree of integration in Global Value Chains (GVCs) of the economic sectors affected by a WTO dispute influences members' propensity to change domestic policies when targeted in WTO litigation. The initiation of a WTO dispute against sectors highly integrated in GVCs engenders the emergence of a domestic coalition of pro-trade liberalization groups composed of exporters seeking to avoid the imposition of retaliatory measures and import-dependent firms wishing to exploit the opportunity to access cheaper imports. Under these circumstances, trade-liberalizing responses to WTO legal challenges are therefore more likely. We test this hypothesis by estimating a Cox proportional hazard model and find that GVCs positively impact states' propensity to comply with the WTO dispute settlement panel rulings.","[Yildirim, Aydin B.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, St Jacobstr 2,M-272, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Chatagnier, J.

It discusses why the reception of IGO signals may be problematic within the mass public: many individuals lack the attention and knowledge to process them. And among those who are attentive and knowledgeable, pre-existing negative attitudes about IGOs may lead them to process the signal differently than intended. Using an experimental research design, it presents evidence consistent with an IGO signaling effect from two different scenarios. In an economic scenario, a negative signal from the World Trade Organization reduces support for the government's economic policy. In a security scenario, a positive signal from the United Nations Security Council increases support for the government's military policy. However, both IGO signals are conditional on certain individual-level attributes, and the IGO signal in the security scenario is generally stronger than in the economic scenario.","[Bearce, David H.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cook, Thomas R.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Bearce, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.bearce@colorado.edu,,"Cook, Thomas/0000-0001-8048-5949; BEARCE, DAVID/0000-0001-6239-4066",Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder,Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder,"The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City or the views of the Federal Reserve System.

While concerns about the sustainability of China's growth model are rising, we assess to what extent rebalancing through a hard landing in China would impact other countries. After reviewing the main arguments pointing to a hard landing scenario-historical rebalancing precedents, overinvestment, unsustainable debt trends and real estate bubble-we use a global VAR methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account for their different end-use patterns and consumption intensity in China. According to our estimates, emerging economies would be hardest hit-with a 7.5% cumulated growth loss after 5 years-in particular in Emerging Asia and in commodity-exporting regions such as Latin America. The growth gap between emerging and advanced economies would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling. In the light of these results, both the commodity supercycle and sustained convergence observed in emerging economies over the past decade could be to a large extent attributed to the high and unbalanced growth pattern in China.","[Gauvin, Ludovic] Banque France, Paris, France; [Rebillard, Cyril C.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; Bank of France; International Monetary Fund,"Gauvin, L (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,"Gauvin, Ludovic/0000-0002-6327-9737; Rebillard, Cyril/0000-0001-8972-2701",,,,,73,12,13,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2018,41.0,12,,,SI,,3379,3415,,10.1111/twec.12631,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HE7HH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000453601800007,0

Using household data from the American Housing Survey and Public Use Micro-data Sample, we find that first-generation Asian and Hispanic/Latino immigrants are more likely to live in coresidence households; and this is influenced by immigrant gender, age, education, income, employment and density. Education and income are inversely related to coresiding, while higher immigrant density increases the propensity to coreside. Contextual effects reveal that neighborhoods with a relatively large Caucasian average household size increase coresidence behavior among immigrants; and the income of Caucasians living in the area is inversely related to immigrant coresiding behavior.

To address this question, we use the Exporter Dynamics Dataset, which contains new data on the microstructure of exports for 34 developing countries between 1997 and 2011, and investigate how exporter behaviour is affected by financial crises. We find that financial crises in both the origin and destination countries have a large negative effect on firm, product and destination dynamics, particularly in industries dependent on external finance. Financial crises make the costs of exporting more difficult to meet and in turn reduce firms' ability to start exporting, introduce new products and sell to new destinations. We also find that the impact of financial crises is less pronounced in exporting countries with relatively more open capital accounts, suggesting that portfolio inflows may be a good substitute for underdeveloped domestic financial markets.","[Jaud, Melise; Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jaud, Melise] Lausanne Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank; University of Lausanne; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jaud, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Jaud, M (通讯作者)，Lausanne Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange/0000-0001-8920-4699; Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf/0000-0002-3051-8930",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir ANR-10-LABX-14-01.,,49,3,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1640,1663,,10.1111/twec.12596,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000434646400007,0

We describe the implementation of this procedure in the US-REGEN model and compare impacts on energy system decisions with more common approaches. The results demonstrate how power sector modeling and capacity planning decisions are sensitive to the representation of intra-annual variation and how our proposed approach outperforms simple heuristic selection procedures with lower resolution. The representative hour approach preserves key properties of the joint underlying hourly distributions, whereas seasonal average approaches over-value wind and solar at higher penetration levels and under-value investment in dispatchable capacity by inaccurately capturing the corresponding residual load duration curves.","[Blanford, Geoffrey J.; Bistline, John E.

Employing a novel district-level panel data set, we find that mass mobilization produces a dramatic decrease in cultivated area. Surprisingly, farms with communal land tenure exhibit greater resilience to the labor shock than private farms. The resilience stems from peasants reallocating labor in favor of the commune because of the increased attractiveness of its nonmarket access to land and social insurance.

However, scant evidence exists pertaining to whether parents' impatience and self-control problems impact the obesity status of their children, too. Accordingly, we explore this study question among a large national sample of US adults and their children. Study results confirm previous findings indicating that intertemporal preferences are related to adults' obesity status. Moreover, these results extend the literature by finding that children of impatient or present-biased parents have a significantly higher likelihood of being obese, too. Specifically, parents' low levels of patience and present bias were each independently related to a five-percentage point increase in the likelihood of obesity of their children. These findings were more pronounced when all children were combined in analyses and for the first child; however, they varied for the second and third child. Thus, findings suggest that parents' time preferences and self-control problems likely affect not only their own weight status but that of their children. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While at the product level, the pattern of specialisation barely changed, exporters exhibit new dynamics in international markets: firms not only expanded sales abroad by increasing their exports in existing markets, but also by entering into new destinations and adding new products. That is, new export strategies allowed exporters achieve greater resistance to the variations in the macroeconomic environment. We find that the importance of the different export margins changes overtime: while the currency is depreciated, the intensive margin explains most of export growth, whereas the subextensive and extensive margins become the main source of export growth once the currency appreciates.

However, limits on the size of banks could entail economic costs if they prevent banks from achieving economies of scale. This paper presents new estimates of returns to scale for US banks based on nonparametric, local-linear estimation of bank cost, revenue, and profit functions. We report estimates for both 2006 and 2015 to compare returns to scale some 7 years after the financial crisis and 5 years after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act with returns to scale before the crisis. We find that a high percentage of banks faced increasing returns to scale in cost in both years, including most of the 10 largest bank holding companies. Also, while returns to scale in revenue and profit vary more across banks, we find evidence that the largest four banks operate under increasing returns to scale.","[Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Div Comp Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.;Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Div Comp Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",pww@clemson.edu,"Wheelock, David C/I-5757-2016","Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X",,,,,41,32,36,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Assessing the effects of these tradeoffs on consumer welfare requires estimates of both the degree of the tradeoffs, and consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the foregone benefits. This paper has two objectives. The first is to review recent literature that presents, or can be used to calculate, marginal WTP (MWTP) for vehicle attributes to describe the attributes that have been studied and the estimated MWTP values. We found 52 U.S.-focused papers with sufficient data to calculate WTP values for 142 different vehicle attributes, which we organized into 15 general groups of comfort, fuel availability, fuel costs, fuel type, incentives, model availability, non-fuel operating costs, performance, pollution, prestige, range, reliability, safety, size, and vehicle type. Measures of dispersion around central MWTP values typically show large variation in MWTP values for attributes. We explore factors that may contribute to this large variation via analysis of variance (ANOVA) and find that, although most have statistically significant effects, they account for only about one third of the observed variation. Case studies of papers that provide estimates from a variety of model formulations and estimation methods suggest that decisions made by researchers can strongly influence MWTP estimates. The paper's second objective is to seek consensus estimates for WTP for fuel cost reduction and increased acceleration performance. Meta-analysis of MWTP for reduced fuel cost indicates that estimates based on revealed vs. stated preference data differ, as do estimates from models that account for endogeneity and those that do not. We find greater consistency in estimates of MWTP for acceleration despite substantial uncertainty about the overall mean. We conclude with recommendations for improving the understanding of consumers' MWTP for vehicle attributes.","[Greene, David] Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hossain, Anushah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hofmann, Julia; Beach, Robert] RTI Int, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Helfand, Gloria] US EPA, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Research Triangle Institute; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Greene, D (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dgreen32@utk.edu; anushah.h@berkeley.edu; jhofinann@rti.org; helfand.gloria@epa.gov; rbeach@rti.org,"Greene, David/AAB-1183-2021","Beach, Robert/0000-0001-8549-8546; Greene, David/0000-0002-7667-5376","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EP-C-11-045, EP-C-16-021]",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This research was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under contracts EP-C-11-045 and EP-C-16-021.

This paper analyzes these two standards under imperfect competitive. We limit our attention to (1) short-run analyses and (2) a situation in which all states are subject to the same type of standard. We show that while the cross-subsidy inherent in the performance-based standard might effectively reduce power prices, it could also inflate energy consumption. A dominant firm with a relatively clean endowment under the performance-based standard would be able to manipulate the electricity market as well as to elevate permit prices, which might worsen market outcomes compared to its mass-based counterpart. On the other hand, the cross-subsidy could be the dominant force leading to a higher social welfare if the leader has a relatively dirty endowment.","[Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tanaka, Makoto] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of London; University College London; Stockholm University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",yihsuchen@ucsc.edu; mtanaka@grips.ac.jp; afzal.siddiqui@ucl.ac.uk,"Tanaka, Makoto/M-9489-2014","Tanaka, Makoto/0000-0002-8606-865X; Chen, Yihsu/0000-0002-9990-8232",University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES) [1561144]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [26380291]; JSPS KAKENHI [15H02975]; HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02975] Funding Source: KAKEN,"University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Chen was supported by the University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program and the United States NSF (CyberSEES #1561144).

Major differences exist across countries in how successful these efforts are, and the United States is often used as the key example of a country with a strong resistance to shifting away from private car use. Even within the United States however, there is strong heterogeneity across regions and across different types of travellers. This paper seeks to add empirical evidence to understand the drivers of mode choice for intercity travel, using stated choice data from two major US intercity corridors: the Northeast Corridor (NEC) and the Cascade Corridor. We develop a hybrid choice model that allows for deterministic and random variations across travellers in their preferences, some of which can be linked to underlying attitudinal constructs. Our results highlight extensive heterogeneity and provide interesting insights into the drivers of behaviour, and the relationship between attitudes and actual choices. As an example, we see that for some groups, notably West Coast respondents, a stronger anti-car attitude is counter-acted by a reduced utility for non-car modes when making choices, possibly due quality of public transport provision. Similarly, for other groups, such as older and female travellers, a reduced concern for privacy, which would benefit public transport, is counter-acted by a stronger pro-car attitude. These findings highlight the complex way in which attitudes can influence choices and provide insights for targeted policy interventions. Through scenario testing, we also show how future modal split might change depending on how these patterns of heterogeneity evolve over time, noting that the way this might happen is of course unknown at present.","[Hess, Stephane; Spitz, Greg; Bradley, Mark] RSG, 55 Railrd Row, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Coogan, Matt] New England Transportat Inst, Ten Clay Rd, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@leeds.ac.uk; gspitz@rsginc.com; mark.bradley@rsginc.com; cooganmatt@aol.com,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518",TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),The original study on which this work is based was funded by TRB's NCRRP program.

However, the impact of government policies on gunfire has been difficult to test due to limited and low-quality data. This paper uses new, more accurate data on gunfire (generated by ShotSpotter audio sensors) to measure the effects of juvenile curfews in Washington, DC. Using variation in the hours of the DC curfew, we find that this policy increases gunfire incidents by 150% during marginal hours. In contrast, voluntarily reported crime measures (such as 911 calls) suggest that the curfew decreases gun violence, likely because of confounding effects on reporting rates.","[Carr, Jillian B.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Doleac, Jennifer L.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Carr, JB (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,24,17,22,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We explore alternative approaches for constructing convex combinations of different types of dependence between observations. Pace and LeSage (2002) as well as Hazir et al. (2016) use convex combinations of different connectivity matrices to form a single weight matrix that can be used in conventional spatial regression estimation and inference. An example for the case of two weight matrices, W-1, W-2 reflecting different types of dependence between a cross-section of regions, firms, individuals etc., located in space would be: W-c = gamma(1) W-1+ (1 - gamma(1))W-2, 0 <= gamma(1) <= 1. The matrix W-c reflects a convex combination of the two weight matrices, with the scalar parameter gamma(1) indicating the relative importance assigned to each type of dependence. We explore issues that arise in producing estimates and inferences from these more general cross-sectional regression relationships in a Bayesian framework. We propose two procedures to estimate such models and assess their finite sample properties through Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate our methodology in an application to CEO salaries for a sample of nursing homes located in Texas. Two types of weights are considered, one reflecting spatial proximity of nursing homes and the other peer group proximity, which arise from the salary benchmarking literature.","[Debarsy, Nicolas] Univ Lille, LEM UMR 9221, CNRS, Cite Sci,Bat SH2, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [LeSage, James] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Debarsy, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, LEM UMR 9221, CNRS, Cite Sci,Bat SH2, Villeneuve Dascq, France.",nicolas.debarsy@cnrs.fr; jlesage@spatial-econometrics.com,,"Debarsy, Nicolas/0000-0002-2262-0193",Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA) [2014 00094514],Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA),"Nicolas Debarsy acknowledges financial support of the Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA 2014 00094514).

The results show that better school quality and higher returns to education increase adult incomes and reduce teen birth rates for children from low-income families. By comparing counties within or adjacent to metropolitan areas to other counties, the authors find that urban upward mobility is sensitive to parents' education, while nonurban upward mobility is sensitive to migration opportunities.","[Li, Minghao] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Agr & Reg Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Weber, Bruce] Oregon State Univ, Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Iowa State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Oregon State University,"Li, MH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Li, MH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",minghao@iastate.edu,,"Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X",Pennsylvania State University; USDA-NIFA,Pennsylvania State University; USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded in part by Pennsylvania State University and various USDA-NIFA grants supporting the Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development.",,32,4,5,2,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This unfading popularity is arguably driven by the ability of radial distance functions, unlike alternative directional distance functions, to allow for unit-free multiplicative changes in arguments as well as, by implicitly postulating the radial direction, to free researchers from the dilemma of having to explicitly choose the directional vector. In this paper, we offer a generalization of the standard radial distance function to polluting technologies that can accommodate undesirable by-products in a more economically meaningful way. Specifically, we propose modeling undesirable outputs via a hedonic output index, which is meant to ensure that pollutants are treated as outputs, as opposed to inputs or theoretically unregulated frontier shifters, while also recognizing their undesirable nature. By using a radial input distance function generalized to encompass an (unobservable) hedonic output index of desirable and undesirable outputs, we are able to meaningfully describe relationships between different products (including the complementarity of desirable and undesirable outputs) within producible output sets as well as to represent technically feasible polluting production possibilities given inputs. An empirical application of our methodology to the case of Dutch dairy farms in 2001-2009 demonstrates the complexity of interactions between outputs, thereby attesting to the value of more elaborate representations of production possibilities.","[Malikov, Emir] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Bokusheva, Raushan] OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",emalikov@auburn.edu; raushan.bokusheva@oecd.org; kkar@binghamton.edu,"Bokusheva, Raushan/ABB-1198-2020",,Swiss National Science Foundation [100014_128967],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The data used in the present paper come from the Dutch FADN system as collected by the Dutch Agricultural Economics Research Institute (LEI).

Definitions and categorizations of clusters vary, however, hindering the development of econometric models for cluster analysis. The authors propose empirical measures relevant to researchers and practitioners for cluster strength/specialization, cluster diversity/diversification, and identifying regional growth clusters. The latter measure uses location quotients, shift-share analysis, and other criteria to identify robust clusters that are important for thriving regions. These measures are calculated for local and traded clusters using employment data for 366 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. Additionally, the authors estimated the relationship of their cluster performance measures to four traditional measures of economic performance: growth in gross domestic product, productivity per employee, compensation per employee, and personal income. The authors find traded cluster strength is positively related to compensation per employee growth and positively related to productivity growth, the latter being consistent with expected Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities. Traded growth clusters are positively related to gross domestic product growth.","[Slaper, Timothy F.; Harmon, Karter M.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Rubin, Barry M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Harmon, KM (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Indiana Business Res Ctr, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kartharm@indiana.edu,,,,,,,31,26,28,1,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

First, older houses have a higher price growth rate than younger ones, even after controlling for location and other attributes; second, the age depreciation of house price, defined as the decline of house price with respect to house age, is slower than the similarly-defined age depreciation of rent. These hypotheses are supported by the micro-data on housing market in Beijing.

Results indicate high levels of usage and approval of the shoes by children in the treatment group, and time diaries show modest evidence that the donated shoes allocated children's time toward outdoor activities. Difference-in-difference and ANCOVA estimates find generally insignificant impacts on overall health, foot health, and self-esteem but small positive impacts on school attendance for boys. Children receiving the shoes were significantly more likely to state that outsiders should provide for the needs of their family. Thus, in a context where most children already own at least one pair of shoes, the overall impact of the shoe donation program appears to be negligible, illustrating the importance of more careful targeting of in-kind donation programs.","[Wydick, Bruce; Katz, Elizabeth] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Wydick, Bruce] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Calvo, Flor] 3Ie, Washington, DC USA; [Gutierrez, Felipe] Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Gutierrez, Felipe] Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Phoenix, AZ USA",University of San Francisco; University of Notre Dame; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); University of Arizona,"Wydick, B (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.;Wydick, B (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",wydick@usfca.edu; egkatz@usfca.edu; facalvo@dons.usfca.edu; felipe.gutierrez@va.gov; bjanet0@gmail.com,,,USF Faculty Development Fund; TOMS Shoes,USF Faculty Development Fund; TOMS Shoes,"Bruce Wydick (corresponding author) is a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco and Research Affiliate, Kellogg Institute of International Studies, University of Notre Dame; his email address is wydick@usfca.edu.Elizabeth Katz is an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco; her email address is egkatz@usfca.edu.Flor Calvo is a research assistant at 3ie in Washington, DC; her email address is facalvo@dons.usfca.edu.Felipe Gutierrez is a physician with the Veterans Affairs Health Care System and the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona; his email address isfelipe.gutierrez@va.gov.Brendan Janet is an independent field research consultant; his email address is bjanet0@gmail.com.We would like to thank Zachary Intemann, Nicole Shevloff, and the directors and staff of World Vision El Salvador for extensive help during field research and David McKenzie, Robert Jensen, and Yaniv Stopnitsky for helpful comments.

After describing patterns of selection into unions, we measure the union wage premium using unconditional quantile methods. The wage premium was larger at the bottom of the income distribution than at the middle or higher, larger for African Americans than for whites, and larger for those with low levels of education.

Additionally, given that uncertainty may influence Federal Reserve decisions, we incorporate an uncertainty index in the reaction function of the Federal Reserve.

This research investigates the optimal balance between the risk of overinvesting in non-carbon sources that are ultimately not needed and the risk of underinvesting in non-carbon sources and subsequently needing to reduce carbon emissions dramatically. We employ a novel framework that incorporates a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U.S. into a two-stage stochastic approximate dynamic program (ADP) focused on decisions in the electric power sector. We solve the model using an ADP algorithm that is computationally tractable while exploring the decisions and sampling the uncertain carbon limits from continuous distributions. The results of the model demonstrate that an optimal hedge is in the direction of more non-carbon investment in the near-term, in the range of 20-30% of new generation. We also demonstrate that the optimal share of non-carbon generation is increasing in the variance of the uncertainty about the long-term carbon targets, and that with greater uncertainty in the future policy regime, a balanced portfolio of non-carbon, natural gas, and coal generation is desirable.","[Morris, Jennifer F.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Srikrishnan, Vivek; Webster, Mort D.] Penn State Univ, John & Willie Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral, State Coll, PA USA; [Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Morris, JF (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",holak@mit.edu,"; Srikrishnan, Vivek/J-1966-2015","Morris, Jennifer/0000-0001-7675-558X; Srikrishnan, Vivek/0000-0003-0049-3805","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-SC0003906, DE-FG-0294ER61937]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [XA-83600001-1]; National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF [GEO-1240507]; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences [1240507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0003906] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science under grants DE-SC0003906 and DE-FG-0294ER61937; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under grant XA-83600001-1; the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement GEO-1240507 and the Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; and other government, industry, and foundation sponsors of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

The results also indicate that most price elasticities are smaller relative to developed countries; the effect of fuel prices on natural gas demand is partly offset by the government regulation. In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, China's natural gas demand will reach 340 bcm and 528 bcm and its foreign dependence will reach 27.9% and 43.2% in 2020 and 2030, respectively.

We find that mitigating capital structure risks ahead of the crisis by reducing leverage and extending debt maturity in 2006 was associated with a significantly higher cumulative total return 2007-2009, after controlling for the levels of those variables at the start of the financial crisis. We further identify two systematic cross-sectional differences between those REITs that reduced capital structure risks prior to the financial crisis and those that did not: the exposure to capital structure risks and the strength of corporate governance. On balance, our findings are consistent with the interpretation of risk-reducing adjustments to capital structure ahead of the crisis as a component of managerial skill and discipline with significant implications for firm value during the crisis.","[Pavlov, Andrey] Simon Fraser Univ, 500 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6C 1W6, Canada; [Steiner, Eva] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Wachter, Susan] Univ Penn, 430 Vance Hall,3733 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Simon Fraser University; University of Cambridge; University of Pennsylvania,"Pavlov, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, 500 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6C 1W6, Canada.",apavlov@sfu.ca; es434@cam.ac.uk; wachter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Steiner, Eva/GQP-3194-2022; Wachter, Susan/AAW-2226-2020; Pavlov, Andrey/HGB-3637-2022","Pavlov, Andrey/0000-0001-7891-269X",Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2012-0929],Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Susan Wachter acknowledges financial support from the Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

A robustness analysis of stated choice experimental designs,THEORY AND DECISION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Stated choice experiments; Robustness; Mode choice model; Value-of-time; Experimental design; D-efficient,DEPARTURE TIME,"This paper is motivated by the increasing popularity of efficient designs for stated choice experiments. The objective in efficient designs is to create a stated choice experiment that minimizes the standard errors of the estimated parameters. In order to do so, such designs require specifying prior values for the parameters to be estimated. While there is significant literature demonstrating the efficiency improvements (and cost savings) of employing efficient designs, the bulk of the literature tests conditions where the priors used to generate the efficient design are assumed to be accurate. However, there is substantially less literature that compares how different design types perform under varying degree of error of the prior. The literature that does exist assumes small fractions are used (e.g., under 20 unique choice tasks generated), which is in contrast to computer-aided surveys that readily allow for large fractions. Further, the results in the literature are abstract in that there is no reference point (i.e., meaningful units) to provide clear insight on the magnitude of any issue. Our objective is to analyze the robustness of different designs within a typical stated choice experiment context of a trade-off between price and quality. We use as an example transportation mode choice, where the key parameter to estimate is the value of time (VOT). Within this context, we test many designs to examine how robust efficient designs are against a misspecification of the prior parameters. The simple mode choice setting allows for insightful visualizations of the designs themselves and also an interpretable reference point (VOT) for the range in which each design is robust. Not surprisingly, the D-efficient design is most efficient in the region where the true population VOT is near the prior used to generate the design: the prior is $20/h and the efficient range is $10-$30/h. However, the D-efficient design quickly becomes the most inefficient outside of this range (under $5/h and above $40/h), and the estimation significantly degrades above $50/h. The orthogonal and random designs are robust for a much larger range of VOT. The robustness of Bayesian efficient designs varies depending on the variance that the prior assumes. Implementing two-stage designs that first use a small sample to estimate priors are also not robust relative to uninformative designs. Arguably, the random design (which is the easiest to generate) performs as well as any design, and it (as well as any design) will perform even better if data cleaning is done to remove choice tasks where one alternative dominates the other.","[Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Global Metropolitan Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Yanqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thorhauge, Mikkel] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Ben-Akiva, Moshe] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 1-181,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Technical University of Denmark; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Walker, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Global Metropolitan Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",joanwalker@berkeley.edu; yanqiaowang@berkeley.edu; mtho@dtu.dk; mba@mit.edu,"Thorhauge, Mikkel/L-5711-2016","Thorhauge, Mikkel/0000-0002-1887-7527; Ben-Akiva, Moshe/0000-0002-9635-9987",,,,,48,68,75,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84.0,2,,,SI,,215,238,,10.1007/s11238-017-9647-3,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425621300005,0

Evidence from the Firm Level,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; China; FDI; Outward Direct Investment,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; KNOWLEDGE-CAPITAL MODEL; FDI; LOCATION,"China's increased trade with, and investment in, Africa have boosted the continent's economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. The aggregate data on China's overseas direct investment (ODI) in African countries reveal that China's share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China's attraction to resource- rich countries is no different from Western investment. China's overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. Micro data from MOFCOM's database on registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012 provide a different perspective. Key words in project descriptions are used to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. Country-sector-level regressions based on firms' transaction-level data find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, like investment from other countries. In particular, regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments.","[Chen, Wenjie] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Dollar, David] Brookings Inst, John L Thornton China Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tang, Heiwai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitze Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; Brookings Institution; Johns Hopkins University,"Dollar, D (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, John L Thornton China Ctr, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",chenw@gwu.edu; DDollar@brookings.edu; hwtang@jhu.edu,,"Chen, Wenjie/0000-0001-5030-5927",,,,,50,80,86,5,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

In particular, we document a strong pattern of upward mobility out of poverty, with a noticeable acceleration between 2009-10 and 2011-12. We examine some of the key household characteristics of those who have managed to escape poverty and contrast these with those who have fallen into an undesirable welfare status during these periods.

We investigate the impacts of foreclosures on local government tax revenues, using a reduced form estimation approach that relates changes in foreclosures to changes in local government tax revenues. Unlike most previous work, we focus mainly on the nationwide revenue impacts of new foreclosures, using data across all local governments in the entire United States during the worst years of the Great Recession. We also use an instrumental variable approach that controls for possible endogeneity of foreclosures and housing prices. Overall, we find evidence that the new foreclosures had a direct, negative, but small effect on total tax revenues at the local level, although there is only weak evidence that this impact can be attributed to declines in local property taxes. However, we also find that foreclosures had an indirect and negative impact on local governments via declines in state government funding. We suggest that foreclosures may have affected the real economy, thereby reducing the state government revenues dependent on real economic activity that were used to finance transfers to local governments.","[Alm, James; Leguizamon, J.

In these cases it is more appropriate to conduct welfare analysis using inverse demand models that take quantities as given and allow prices to adjust to clear the market. One challenge faced by economists conducting demand analysis is how to limit the number of commodities in the analysis while accounting for the relevant substitutability and complementarity among goods. A common approach in direct demand modeling is to assume weak separability of the utility function and apply a multi-stage budgeting approach. This approach has not, however, been applied to an inverse demand system or the associated welfare analysis. This paper develops a two-stage inverse demand model and derives the total quantity flexibilities which describe how market clearing prices respond to supply changes in other commodity groups. The model provides the means to estimate consumer welfare impacts of an increase in finfish and shellfish harvest from the Chesapeake Bay while recognizing that harvests from other regions are potential substitutes. Comparing the two-stage results with single-stage analysis of the same data shows that ignoring differentiation of harvests from different regions, or the availability of substitutes not affected by a supply shock, can bias welfare estimates.","[Moore, Chris; Griffiths, Charles] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW,MC 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Moore, C (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave NW,MC 1809T, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",moore.chris@epa.gov,"Moore, Chris/I-4802-2017","Moore, Chris/0000-0002-6972-2787",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,26,6,6,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We estimate discrete choice migration models to quantify the trade-offs across locations faced by veterans. Veterans were more likely to move to a neighborhood or county where men from their same war company lived and were more likely to move to such areas than to areas where other veterans were located. Veterans also were less likely to move far from their origin and avoided urban immigrant areas and high mortality risk areas. They also avoided areas that opposed the Civil War.

The theoretical result obtained by Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) is that a higher wage has offsetting effects on commuting by increasing both the demand for housing and the time cost of commuting. This study places these offsetting effects in a model of bid-rent for a two-worker household that extends the model presented by White (1977). The basic finding is that an increase in the wage rate increases the worker's commuting time by a small statistically significant amount. The result holds for both husbands and wives. The net effect of a higher wage on commuting time is positive and small. As other studies have found, commuting time is greater for husbands than for wives.","[Hong, Sung Hyo] Kongju Natl Univ, Div Econ & Trade, Gongju 314701, Chungchungnam D, South Korea; [Lee, Bun Song] Univ Arkansas, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Ft Smith, AR 72913 USA; [McDonald, John F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ & Finance, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",Kongju National University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fort Smith; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"McDonald, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ & Finance, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",shong11@kongju.ac.kr; bun.lee@uafs.edu; mcdonald@uic.edu,,,,,,,18,7,7,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We study the impact of that buffer on the volatility of oil prices. After estimating the stochastic process that generates shocks to demand and supply, and assessing OPEC's limited ability to accurately measure and offset those shocks, we find that OPEC's use of spare capacity has reduced price volatility, perhaps by as much as half. We also apply the principle of revealed preference to infer the implicit loss function that rationalizes OPEC's investment in spare capacity and compare it to other estimates of the cost of crude oil supply shortfalls.

Drawing on relational theory, we identify four dimensions of ethnicity that are each important in distinctive ways in Ukraine: individual language preference, language embeddedness, ethnolinguistic identity, and nationality. Using original survey data collected in May 2014, we show that the choice of one over the other can be highly consequential for the conclusions one draws about ethnicity's role in shaping attitudes (e.g. to NATO membership), actions (e.g. participation in the Euromaidan protests), and the anticipation of outgroups' behavior (e.g. expectations of a Russian invasion). Moreover, we call attention to the importance of including the right control variables for precisely interpreting any posited effects of ethnicity, making specific recommendations for future survey research on ethnic identity in Ukraine.","[Onuch, Olga] Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hale, Henry E.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Manchester; George Washington University,"Onuch, O (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England.",olga.onuch@manchester.ac.uk,"Onuh, Ol'ga/A-2726-2015","Onuh, Ol'ga/0000-0002-6442-035X",National Science Foundation [SES-1445194],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number SES-1445194].,,79,39,43,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

A smaller literature has begun to examine the intergenerational impacts of in utero conditions. A link between these two literatures-the impacts of in utero conditions on family formation-has had few examinations but offers a potential set of mechanisms for the intergenerational reach of early conditions. This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether individuals exposed in utero to the 1918/19 influenza pandemic had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts. The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of type of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. For example, women with in utero exposure during their first trimester marry men with 0.2 fewer years of schooling than those not exposed. The findings show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.

This study examines the effects of proximity to a Mexican restaurant-the dominant type of ethnic fast casual restaurant-on maternal and child health. I match data on the complete residential addresses of all mothers who gave birth in the Miami metropolitan area between 1990 and 2009 to a time series of all establishments (restaurants and stores) selling food and drink. This unique data set allows me to use mother fixed effects and to exploit the variation over time of the food environment to identify the effects on maternal weight gain and childbirth outcomes. The results show that living in proximity to a Mexican restaurant is associated with an 8% lower likelihood of excessive weight gain among US-born mothers. These effects are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and among members of disadvantaged groups (e.g., low-skilled, young, and African American individuals). However, the results show no protective effect for foreign-born mothers. Lastly, there is no evidence of significant effects on other maternal outcomes or on various child health metrics at birth.

In particular, we define a variant of HAPP that has capabilities of forecasting activity selection and durations in addition to activity sequencing. The framework is comprised of three steps, (i) choice set generation, (ii) choice set individualization and (iii) model estimation. The estimation results show that utilities for work, shopping and disutilities for travel time, time outside home, and average tour delay are found to be significant in activity-travel decision making.","[Xu, Zhiheng; Kang, Jee Eun] Univ Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Chen, Roger] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Kang, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jeeeunka@buffalo.edu,,"Chen, Roger/0000-0002-0528-6007; Xu, Zhiheng/0000-0002-1486-6732","Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC); US National Science Foundation (NSF); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1536918] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC); US National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This work, in part, has been funded by the Region II University Transportation Research Center (UTRC) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

Second, local governments respond to the size of these externalities. When a town's boundaries allow it to capture a larger share of retail spillovers, it is more likely to offer retail subsidies. Third, these subsidies partially crowd out private sector mechanisms that also subsidize large retailers, such as shopping malls.

Most attempts to estimate the natural rate use a closed-economy framework. We argue that in the face of greater integration of global product and capital markets, an open economy framework is more appropriate. We provide some initial estimates of the natural rate for the USA and Japan in a two-country framework. Our identifying assumptions include a close relationship between the time-varying natural rate of interest and the low-frequency fluctuations of potential output growth in both the home country and the foreign country. Our results suggest that the natural rates in both countries are mainly determined by their own trend growth rates of potential output.

These strategies are collectively referred to as flexible-sharing strategies, and are modelled parsimoniously using a single parameter to describe their performance at the local level. This model provides a solid building block to examine these strategies at large infrastructure levels. We build an analytical framework with input output systems and fixed set theory to evaluate bimodal arterials with flexible-sharing strategies implemented at multiple locations. Using this framework, the performance of a bimodal arterial is quantified by a set of vehicle throughput. This set is convex with linear constraints, which can be used to solve optmization problems on bimodal arterials. The requirements to efficiently identify links and nodes to install flexible-sharing strategies along a bimodal arterial are mathematically established. Lastly, one particular flexible-sharing strategy, the pre-signal, is illustrated as an example both mathematically and with a calibrated simulation.","[He Haitao; Menendez, Monica] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Transport Planning & Syst, Traff Engn Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guler, S.

In contrast to prevailing literature focusing on entrepreneurial firms, this study offers insights on how social networks function in defense contractors, which tend to be mature firms. The main conclusion is that having more network connections is associated with faster short-term employment growth (from 2014 to 2015) for defense contractors, but there is a limit to that benefit. The analysis also shows that social networks do not aid market diversification for defense contractors. This poses an interesting challenge for defense contractors, as they need to balance the priorities of short-term growth and long-term success.","[Shuai, Xiaobing; Chmura, Christine] Chmura Econ & Analyt, 1309 East Cary St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Shuai, Xiaobing; Chmura, Christine] Univ Richmond, Richmond, VA USA",University of Richmond,"Shuai, XB (通讯作者)，Chmura Econ & Analyt, 1309 East Cary St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",xshuai@richmond.edu,,,"Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD","Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was prepared under contract with MassDevelopment with financial support from the Office of Economic Adjustment, DoD.",,24,1,2,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We study negotiated transaction prices in the commercial real estate market, which is characterized by heterogeneous assets, illiquidity, and highly segmented local markets, all of which increase the importance of asymmetric information in negotiated pricing outcomes. Using 114,588 industrial, multi-family and office sale transactions that occurred during 1997-2011, we document that distant commercial real estate buyers pay, on average, premiums of 4 % to 15 % relative to local buyers, controlling for individual property characteristics as well as time fixed-effects. We also examine the extent to which the sources of these observed premiums are a product of higher search costs/information asymmetry problems associated with distance (search cost channel) or a result of reference-dependence preference/anchoring based on the price levels in the investors' local market (behavioral biases channel). Our results suggest the observed price premiums are explained by distant investors who face higher search costs and are at an information disadvantage compared to investors located in closer proximity to the property. In contrast, anchoring plays a more muted role in explaining observed premiums. The use of an intermediary (broker) increases, on average, the acquisition prices of buyers and decreases the disposition prices of sellers by 3 % to 8 %. This result is consistent with the incentive real estate agents have to convince sellers to dispose of their properties too quickly and to convince buyers to search less and therefore pay higher prices.","[Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Hough Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Petrova, Milena T.] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Syracuse University,"Petrova, MT (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",david.ling@warrington.ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@warrington.ufl.edu; mpetrova@syr.edu,"Petrova, Milena/AAX-5309-2021",,Real Estate Research Institute,Real Estate Research Institute,"We thank the Real Estate Research Institute for providing partial funding of this project.

New York's money-center banks anticipated the onset of a financial crisis, prepared for it by accumulating substantial reserves, and during the European crisis, continued business as usual. New York's leading bankers deliberately and collectively decided on the business-as-usual policy in order to minimize the impact of the panic in the United States.

Theory suggests that if the cost of owning a car increases, people will use other modes of transportation, thus reducing house prices farther away from the CBD and increasing house prices closer to the city center. However, in an empirical setting, the cost of car ownership is likely to be endogenous and correlated with various unobserved factors that also contribute to changes in the house price gradient. To obtain causal effects, we exploit a unique feature of Singapore's car registration process. All cars in Singapore must have a Certificate of Entitlement (COE), but the number available is restricted based on the traffic concerns of the government and are allocated through a competitive bidding process. We use the number of COEs available each quarter as an instrument for the price of a COE, as the quota is likely to be correlated with the price of the COE but not the price of housing at various distances from the CBD. We find that when the price of a COE increases, the price of housing closer to the city center increases, suggesting that increases in the price of a car cause individuals to increase their willingness to pay to locate closer to the CBD.","[Huang, Naqun] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Urban Dev, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Ross, Amanda] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Nanjing Audit University; Singapore Management University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Ross, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224,Alston 248, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",naqun.huang.2012@phdecons.smu.edu.sg; lijing@smu.edu.sg; aross@cba.ua.edu,"Ross, Amanda/AAI-9138-2020; Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X; , Naqun/0000-0003-2559-2690",,,,,34,7,7,3,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

I study parliament's passage of estate bills, a legislation that broke restrictions on land use and made up most of parliament's legislative output from 1660 to 1702 Using a new dataset on estate bills, I first document that the sudden closure (prorogation) of parliament by the monarch caused bills to fail. Probit and OLS estimates show estate bills were 19 percentage points more likely to fail in these sessions. Second, I show conflict delaying revenue bills and conflict with the monarch's interests made sudden prorogations more likely before the Glorious Revolution. Political and constitutional changes with the Glorious Revolution were thus important for England's economic development. They improved parliament's provision of legislation that made property rights more flexible to changing economic opportunities throughout the preindustrial era.","[Dimitruk, Kara] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Dimitruk, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",kdimitru@uci.edu,,,All-UC Economic History Summer Research grant,All-UC Economic History Summer Research grant,"I thank Dan Bogart, Gary Richardson, and Stergios Skaperdas for critical feedback, encouragement, and guidance.

On the one hand, unemployment frees up time for more housework by both men and women. On the other hand, once unemployed, women may take on more additional housework than men do, either because they capitalize on their time to act out traditional gender roles or because unemployment compounds women's general disadvantage in household bargaining. Multi-level analyses based on the European Social Survey show that both men and women perform more housework when unemployed. However, the extra domestic work for unemployed women is greater than for unemployed men. They also spend more time on housework when their husband is unemployed. Compared to their employed counterparts, unemployed women, but not men, perform even more housework in a country where the unemployment rate is higher.","[van der Lippe, Tanja] Univ Utrecht, Sociol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Treas, Judith] Univ Calif Irvine, Sociol, Irvine, CA USA; [Norbutas, Lukas] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, POB 80140, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Utrecht University,"van der Lippe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, POB 80140, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",t.vanderlippe@uu.nl,"Norbutas, Lukas/S-7762-2016","Norbutas, Lukas/0000-0003-4712-5348",European Research Council under European Union/ERC [340045]; European Research Council (ERC) [340045] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement n. 340045.,,58,36,36,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Nominal economic growth swelled required reserves while an exogenous reduction in monetary gold inflows due to war embargoes in Europe allowed excess reserves to naturally decline towards zero. Excess reserves fell rapidly in early 1941 and would have unwound fully even without the entry of the United States into World War II.

For five variables entering TFP, we show that dispersion is significantly smaller in the Census mean-imputed versus the nonimputed data. We use classification and regression trees (CART) to produce multiple imputations with observed data for similar plants. For 90% of the 473 industries in 2002 and 84% of the 471 industries in 2007, we find that TFP dispersion increases as we move from Census mean-imputed data to nonimputed data to the CART-imputed data.","[White, T.

The literature largely focuses on financial indicators that assess the financial depth of banks and stock markets. We examine these indicators jointly with newly developed indicators that assess the stability and efficiency of financial markets. Once we subject the finance-growth regressions to model uncertainty, our results suggest that commonly used indicators of financial development are not robustly related to long-term growth. However, the findings from our global sample indicate that one newly developed indicator-the efficiency of financial intermediaries-is robustly related to long-term growth.","[Hasan, Iftekhar] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Bank Finland, Res Unit, Helsinki, Finland; [Horvath, Roman; Mares, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horvath, Roman] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mares, Jan] Czech Minist Finance, Prague, Czech Republic",Fordham University; Bank of Finland; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Horvath, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.;Horvath, R (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic.",ihasan@fordham.edu; roman.horvath@gmail.com; janxmares@gmail.com,"Mares, Jan/U-7979-2018; Hasan, Iftekhar/IUM-3182-2023; Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020","Mares, Jan/0000-0001-5809-2268; Hasan, Iftekhar/0000-0003-2469-0539; Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-09190S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"We thank Martin Feldkircher and seminar participants at 19th ICMAIF conference (Rethymno, Greece), 32nd International Symposium on Money, Banking and Finance (Nice, France) and 1st World Congress for Comparative Economics (Rome, Italy) for helpful comments.

We expect strong trade unions and left-leaning governments to be associated with more, and more far-reaching labor provisions in PTAs. We also expect the strength of skilled workers relative to the strength of unskilled workers to negatively correlate with the depth of labor provisions in PTAs. In addition, the effect of trade unions should be conditional on both the presence of left government and democracy. We test these hypotheses relying on an original dataset of labor provisions included in 483 PTAs signed between 1990 and 2016. This dataset covers 140 different labor provisions that relate to six overarching dimensions. The quantitative analysis finds support for the expectations concerning the influence of trade unions and the role of a country's skill profile.","[Raess, Damian] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Raess, Damian] Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Dur, Andreas] Univ Salzburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Sari, Dora] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Blvd Pont Arve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sari, Dora] Harvard Law Sch, Labor & Worklife Program, 8 Mt Auburn St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Bern; University of Reading; Salzburg University; University of Geneva; Harvard University,"Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Raess, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Polit Econ & Int Relat, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",damian.raess@wti.org; andreas.duer@sbg.ac.at; dora.sari@etu.unige.ch,"Dür, Andreas/HTN-9240-2023","Dür, Andreas/0000-0001-6621-7243; Sari, Dora/0000-0002-0216-7088",Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,"This paper is part of the Swiss Network for International Studies funded project A Social Clause through the Back Door: Labor Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements (Call for projects 2014; project coordinator: Dr. Damian Raess).

This paper evaluates the distributional consequences of trade liberalization within industries differentiating two distinct aspects in which trade liberalization could result in higher trade flows: the intensive vs. the extensive margin of trade. In particular, we analyze whether trade liberalization leads to increased trade flows because either firms trade more volume in products they have already traded before (intensive margin) or because they start to trade products they have not traded previously (extensive margin), or both. We test these arguments for the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and exporting firms based in Costa Rica for the time-period 2008-2014. The results of our study suggest that the effects of CAFTA-DR depend not only on whether we analyze the extensive versus the intensive margin of trade but also whether the product in question is homogenous or differentiated and whether the exporting firm under analysis is small or large. In particular, we find support for the theoretical expectation that firms exporting heterogeneous products, such as textiles, gain from trade agreements, such as CAFTA-DR, in that they can export more varieties of their products. Yet at the same time, they tend to lose at the intensive margin by a reduction in their trade volume while the opposite pattern occurs for firms exporting homogenous products.","[Spilker, Gabriele] Univ Salzburg, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Bernauer, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kim, In Song] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Milner, Helen] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Osgood, Iain] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tingley, Dustin] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Salzburg University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Princeton University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Harvard University,"Spilker, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salzburg, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",gabriele.spilker@sbg.ac.at,"Song, In/B-2895-2017; Tingley, Dustin/C-8495-2011; Spilker, Gabriele/GWU-7329-2022","Song, In/0000-0002-5774-1585; Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,Paris Lodron University of Salzburg,"Open access funding provided by Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.

To achieve this, we start with a spatial autoregressive model with an acceptable form for the generating process for the elements of the endogenous spatial weights matrix as in Qu and Lee (2015). Our test statistic is simple to calculate because it requires computationally simple estimations. By construction, the test statistic is robust in the sense that its asymptotic null distribution is a centered chi-square distribution regardless of the (local) presence of a spatial autoregressive parameter in the alternative model. We summarize the asymptotic properties of our test statistic under the null and the alternative hypotheses. To investigate its finite sample size and power properties, we conduct a Monte Carlo study. The results are in line with our theoretical findings and indicate that the robust test has good size and power properties.","[Bera, Anil K.; Dogan, Osman] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Taspinar, Suleyman] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ program, New York, NY USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Dogan, O (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",abera@illlnois.edu; odogan@illinois.edu; staspinar@qc.cuny.edu,"Dogan, Osman/HJG-9407-2022; Dogan, Osman/AAW-3381-2021","Dogan, Osman/0000-0001-7324-9454","National Science Foundation [CNS-0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113]; City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island(General Electric),"This research was supported, in part, under National Science Foundation Grants CNS-0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113 and the City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island.",,44,6,6,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Previous research on squatting has shed light on how the provision of formal land titles affects a number of socioeconomic outcomes and a subset of this research has provided estimates on how the provision of formal titles affects property values. However, the phenomenon of squatting encompasses a variety of informal property rights distinct from the possession of a legal title. Using an exceptionally rich household data set including geo-location at the community level we study the effects of both formal and informal property rights on property values. Having a title increases property values by almost 7 percent and squatting on the land by invasion reduces values by about 6 percent. Using these estimates, we determine the potential losses of property tax revenue and are able to study the issue of squatting in the context of public finance.","[Hawley, Zackary; Sawyer, W.

We allow the prize to depend on total performance in the contest and consider the respective cases in which efforts are productive and destructive of prize value. When the contest success function takes a logit form, and marginal cost is increasing in effort, we show that a Nash equilibrium exists and is unique both in productive and destructive endogenous prize contests. In equilibrium, the underdog expends more resources to win the prize, but still his probability of winning remains below that of the favorite. In a productive contest, the underdog behaves more aggressively and wins the prize more often in comparison to a fixed-value contest. Thus, the degree of competitive balance-defined as the level of uncertainty of the outcome-depends upon the (fixed or endogenous) prize nature of the contest.","[Damianov, Damian S.; Yildizparlak, Anil] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Sanders, Shane] Syracuse Univ, Falk Coll, Dept Sport Management, 440 White Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Durham University; Syracuse University,"Damianov, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",damian.damianov@durham.ac.uk; sdsander@syr.edu; anil.yildizparlak@durham.ac.uk,,"Yildizparlak, Anil/0000-0002-7115-6075",,,,,40,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,435,453,,10.1007/s11238-018-9661-0,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000448446600009,0

Between 1908 and 1933, county governments enacted county health departments (CHDs) that provided sanitation and child-oriented health services. Using an event study design, I exploit variation in the location and timing of CHD arrival to measure the health effects. I find that CHD entry led to a decline in infant mortality, but provided little advantage to overall population health. For infants, CHDs prevented two deaths per 1000 births, which accounts for 8-10% of the period-specific mortality decline. The effect is most substantial in rural-only counties where infant mortality declines by roughly three deaths per 1000 births.","[Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA",Bryn Mawr College,"Hoehn-Velasco, L (通讯作者)，Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Econ, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",lvelasco@brynmawr.edu,,"Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren/0000-0003-4054-9789",,,,,35,11,13,0,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

The complex and time varying relationship between oil prices and stock markets has caught the attention of the financial press, investors, policymakers, researchers, and the general public in recent years. In light of such attention, this paper reviews research on the oil price and stock market relationship. The majority of papers we survey study the impacts of oil markets on stock markets, whereas, little research in the reverse direction exists. Our review finds that the causal effects between oil and stock markets depend heavily on whether research is performed using aggregate stock market indices, sectorial indices, or firm-level data and whether stock markets operate in net oil-importing or net oil-exporting countries. Additionally, conclusions vary depending on whether studies use symmetric or asymmetric changes in the price of oil, or whether they focus on unexpected changes in oil prices. Finally, we find that most studies show oil price volatility transmits to stock market volatility, and that including measures of stock market performance improves forecasts of oil prices and oil price volatility. Several important avenues for further research are identified.","[Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros; Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England; [Arora, Vipin] US Energy Informat Adm, 100 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA",Panteion University; Bournemouth University,"Filis, G (通讯作者)，Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syggrou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece.;Filis, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021; Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019","Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973;",,,,,187,128,135,5,145,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2018,39.0,5,,,,,85,130,,10.5547/01956574.39.5.sdeg,0.0,,,46,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GR6AF,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000442725200004,0

As such, quantitative assessments of its potential effects are of considerable interest. One of the most widely used techniques for evaluating the economic impact of regional trading agreements is numerical simulation with computable general equilibrium, or CGE, models. There have now been a large number of papers written that use CGE methods to analyse the potential economic impact of the TPP agreement under varying theoretical and policy assumptions.

This study uses migration to quantify the importance of Ricardian technology differences for international trade. The framework provides the first panel estimates connecting country-industry productivity and exports, and the study exploits heterogeneous technology diffusion from immigrant communities in the United States for identification. The latter instruments are developed by combining panel variation on the development of new technologies across US cities with historical settlement patterns for migrants from countries. The instrumented elasticity of export growth on the intensive margin with respect to the exporter's productivity growth is between 1.6 and 2.4, depending upon weighting. This provides an important contribution to the trade literature of Ricardian advantages, and it establishes a connection of migration to home country exports beyond bilateral networks.","[Kerr, William R.] Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kerr, William R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.;Kerr, WR (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",wkerr@hbs.edu,,,National Science Foundation; MIT George Schultz Fund; HBS Research; Innovation Policy and Economy Group,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MIT George Schultz Fund; HBS Research; Innovation Policy and Economy Group,"I am grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Pol Antras, David Autor, Dany Bahar, Nick Bloom, Ricardo Caballero, Arnaud Costinot, Julian Di Giovanni, Robert Feenstra, Fritz Foley, Richard Freeman, Gordon Hansen, Sam Kortum, Ashley Lester, Matt Mitchell, Peter Morrow, Ramana Nanda, Giovanni Peri, Hillel Rapoport, Ariell Reshef, Tim Simcoe, Antonio Spilimbergo, Scott Stern, Sarah Turner, and John Van Reneen for advice on this project and to seminar participants at the eighth AFD-World Bank Migration and Development Conference, American Economic Association meetings, Clemson University, Columbia University, European Regional Science Association meetings, Georgetown University, Harvard University, International Monetary Fund, London School of Economics, MIT Economics, MIT Sloan, NBER High Skilled Immigration Conference, NBER Productivity, Queens University, University of California Davis, University of Helsinki, University of Toronto Rotman, World Bank, and Yale University for helpful comments.

We exploit this heterogeneity of Okun's coefficients to directly examine the potential factors that shape Okun's law, and find that indicators of more flexible labor markets (higher levels of education achievement in the population, lower rate of unionization, and a higher share of non-manufacturing employment) are important determinants of the differences in Okun's coefficient across states.","[Guisinger, Amy Y.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO USA; [Sinclair, Tara M.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Lafayette College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; George Washington University,"Guisinger, AY (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",guisinga@lafayette.edu,"Sinclair, Tara M/I-2772-2019; Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben/P-4834-2018; Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016","Sinclair, Tara M/0000-0002-1990-3264; Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432",Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP),Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP),"Diana A.

This special issue addresses two important questions about the compatibility of diverse growth models within the European Union (EU): Are some growth regimes better suited to European integration than others? and does the EU favour a particular constellation of domestic institutions? Contributions within this special issue provide a qualified yes to these questions, concluding that the EU favours export-led growth models whilst it penalises and discourages domestic consumption-oriented growth paths, particularly those that are financed by debt accumulation. While recent comparative capitalism literature highlights that European monetary integration has favoured export-led growth regimes, contributions in this special issue outline that the EU's prioritisation of export-led growth over domestic demand-led growth is present in other facets of integration, including EU accession, financial integration, the free movement of people, fiscal governance and the Europe 2020 growth strategy. Findings here provide important insights for both the European integration and comparative capitalism literature, highlighting that the unique economic ties being forged within the European project may be problematic for those countries outside northwestern Europe and for workers in low-wage domestic sectors.","[Johnston, Alison] Oregon State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bexell Hall 339, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Regan, Aidan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",Oregon State University; University College Dublin,"Johnston, A (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bexell Hall 339, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",alison.johnston@oregonstate.edu,,"Regan, Aidan/0000-0001-7558-730X",,,,,87,52,54,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We review the debates prompted by LI's three core claims about national preference formation, intergovernmental bargaining and institutional choice, as well as by the theory's three policy-relevant corollaries relating to the EU's democratic deficit, its constitutional settlement and its role in the world. Liberal intergovernmentalism, we argue, remains highly relevant in today's EU, offering important insights and serving to structure much of the academic debate about the prospects of the Union in a time of crisis. Nevertheless, a revitalized LI faces the dual challenges of theorizing both the causes and consequences of mass politicization of EU politics, as well as the prospect of endogenous change in the direction of greater integration or disintegration.","[Kleine, Mareike] London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Pollack, Mark] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kleine, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.o.kleine@lse.ac.uk,"Kleine, Mareike/AAP-6202-2020; Pollack, Mark/ADW-3218-2022","Kleine, Mareike/0000-0002-7442-7328;",EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,EUI's Robert Schuman Centre; Temple University; Princeton University's EU Program,"We would like to thank Frank Schimmelfennig and Alasdair Young for their comments on early drafts of this introduction.

Evidence from Jordan,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; inequality of opportunity; intergenerational mobility; Middle East; supply of schooling,ATTAINMENT; POLICY; WORLD,"The impact of the growth of the local supply of public schools in the post-Colonial period on intergenerational mobility in education is a first-order question in the Arab World. This question is examined in Jordan using a unique dataset that links individual data on own schooling and parents' schooling for adults, from a household survey, with the supply of schools in the subdistrict of birth at the time the individual was of age to enroll, from a school census. The identification strategy exploits the variation in the supply of basic and secondary public schools across cohorts and subdistricts of birth in Jordan, controlling for year and subdistrict-of-birth fixed effects and interactions of governorate and year-of-birth fixed effects. The findings show that the local availability of basic public schools does, in fact, increase intergenerational mobility in education. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in the supply of basic public schools per 1,000 people reduces the father-son and mother-son associations of schooling by 18-20 percent and the father-daughter and mother-daughter associations by 33-44 percent. However, an increase in the local supply of secondary public schools does not seem to have an effect on the intergenerational mobility in education.","[Assaad, Ragui] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Saleh, Mohamed] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Saleh, Mohamed] Inst Adv Study, Toulouse, France",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Assaad, R (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",assaad@umn.edu; mohamed.saleh@tse-fr.eu,"Saleh, Mohamed/JXL-8647-2024","Saleh, Mohamed/0000-0002-2403-9300",Economic Research Forumas part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region; ANR-Labex IAST,Economic Research Forumas part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region; ANR-Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Ragui Assaad (corresponding author) is a professor at Humphrey School of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota; his e-mail address is assaad@umn.edu.Mohamed Saleh is an assistant professor at Toulouse School of Economics and Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse; his e-mail address ismohamed.saleh@tse-fr.eu.This article was supported by a grant from the Economic Research Forum as part of the research project on Inequality of Opportunity and Inequality of Outcomes in the Arab Region.

Favorable cost-benefit ratios then depend on low costs. This paper calculates the costs of microcredit and other elements of the microcredit business model using proprietary data on 1,335 microfinance institutions between 2005 and 2009, jointly serving 80.1 million borrowers. The costs of making small loans to poorer clients are high, and when revenues fall short of costs, subsidies are necessary to deliver services to those clients on a sustainable basis. Using a method that accounts for the opportunity costs of all forms of subsidy, the analysis finds that the median institution receives five cents of subsidy per dollar lent and $51 of subsidy per borrower (in PPP-adjusted terms). Relatively low levels of median subsidy suggest that even modest benefits of microcredit could yield impressive cost-benefit ratios. The distribution of subsidies is highly skewed, however: the average subsidy per dollar lent is 13 cents, and the average subsidy per borrower is $248. The data show that subsidies per borrower are substantially higher for commercial microfinance banks and some non-bank financial institutions that make relatively large loans. MFIs organized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in contrast, generally rely less on subsidy.","[Cull, Robert] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Demirguc-Kunt, Asli] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Res, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Morduch, Jonathan] NYU, Publ Policy & Econ, Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; New York University,"Cull, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rcull@worldbank.org; ademirguckunt@worldbank.org; jmorduch@nyu.edu,,,,,,,34,44,45,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Its two major components - carbon dioxide reduction and albedo modification - present diverse collective action and strategic aspects. Carbon dioxide reduction may be characterized by Prisoners' Dilemma, threshold, or harmony games, depending on capture and sequestration procedures. In contrast, albedo modification may abide by chicken, coordination, or threshold games. Once deployed, albedo modification presents an addiction problem that makes current efforts difficult to alter, even by countries originally opposed to such modification. With its many procedures, geoengineering is tied to a host of collective action problems that may ensue prior, during, or after geoengineering deployment. For carbon dioxide reduction, governance concerns encouraging action, while for albedo modification, governance concerns inhibiting unilateral action. The latter may be a more difficult governance issue.","[Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,38,9,9,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

For this purpose, we decompose the inflation gap, the difference between actual inflation and the inflation target, into predictable and unpredictable components. We argue that the central banks are successful if the predictable component diminishes over time. The predictable component of the inflation gap is measured by the conditional mean of a parsimonious time-varying autoregressive model. Our results find considerable heterogeneity in the success of these IT countries in achieving their targets at the start of this policy regime. Our findings suggest that the central banks of the IT adopting countries started targeting inflation implicitly before becoming an explicit inflation targeter. The panel data analysis suggests that the relative success of these countries in reducing the gap is influenced by their institutional characteristics, particularly fiscal discipline and macroeconomic performance.","[Ardakani, Omid M.] Georgia Southern Univ, Econ, Savannah, GA USA; [Kishor, N.

There has been renewed interest in this question since the large and persistent fall in the real price of oil in 2014-16. In the context of this debate, Ramey (2017) makes the striking claim that the existing literature on the transmission of oil price shocks is fundamentally confused about the question of how to quantify the effect of oil price shocks. In particular, she asserts that the discretionary income effect on private consumption, which plays a central role in contemporary accounts of the transmission of oil price shocks to the U.S. economy, makes no economic sense and has no economic foundation. Ramey suggests that the literature has too often confused the terms-of-trade effect with this discretionary income effect, and she makes the case that the effects of the oil price decline of 2014-16 on private consumption are smaller for a multitude of reasons than suggested by empirical models of the discretionary income effect. We review the main arguments in Ramey (2017) and show that none of her claims hold up to scrutiny. Our analysis highlights the theoretical basis of the discretionary income effect. We also discuss improved regression-based estimates of this effect that allow for changes in the dependence on oil and gasoline imports, and we highlight the fact that alternative estimates used by policymakers involve strong simplifying assumptions.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Baumeister, Christiane; Kilian, Lutz] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zhou, Xiaoqing] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Notre Dame; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Bank of Canada,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,39,23,25,0,2,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,2,,117,137,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI2.cbau,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VJ6RI,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000616698300007,0

However, only large firms from developing countries (similar in size to those from developed ones) issue bonds and syndicated loans.

Using a time-varying parameter model with stochastic volatility for real GDP growth and inflation allows their dynamics to change over time, approximating nonlinearities in the data that otherwise would not be adequately accounted for with linear models [Granger, Clive W.J., Timo Terasvirta, and Heather M. Anderson. 1991. Modeling Non-linearity over the Business Cycle. In NBER book Business Cycles, Indicators and Forecasting (1993), edited by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson, University of Chicago Press.; Granger, Clive W. J. 2008. Non-Linear Models: Where Do We Go Next - Time Varying Parameter Models? Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics 12 (3): 1-11.]. With that empirical model, I document a period of declining macro volatility since the 1980s, followed by increasing (and diverging) inflation volatility since the mid-1990s. I also find significant shifts in inflation persistence and cyclicality, as well as in macro synchronization and even forecastability. The 2008 global recession appears to have had an impact on some of this. I ground my empirical strategy on the reduced-form solution of the workhorse New Keynesian model and, motivated by theory, explore the relationship between greater trade openness (globalization) and the reported shifts in international business cycle. I show that globalization has sizeable (yet nonlinear) effects in the data consistent with the implications of the model - yet globalization's contribution is not a foregone conclusion, depending crucially on more than the degree of openness of the international economy.","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",emg.economics@gmail.com,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",,,,,87,6,6,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

In addition, issues of endogeneity between bad health and subjective well-being are ignored when it comes to survival. We assess both for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS; 1991-2008) and specifically analyze whether subjective well-being predicts better chances of surviving diseases such as cancer or heart conditions. We find that several of the studied diseases consistently decrease survival chances in our sample (e.g. hazard ratio 3.47 for cancer), also when controlling for the severity of health problems. But our results do not suggest that well-being mitigates the effect these diseases have on mortality. Life satisfaction also does not predict longer survival in the data set if we control for the endogeneity of subjective well-being. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The smart mobility options include shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus facilities. While previous surveys on smart mobility options had investigated limited number of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the smart mobility options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135 alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design. The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the non-traditional survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional public transport modes are favoured over smart mobility options. These findings, as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement smart mobility options in Lisbon as well as in other cities.

Two major rebel groups benefited from cash and in-kind transfers, the CNDD-FDD from 2004, and the FNL from 2010. We combine panel data of households collected in 2006 and 2010 with official records from the National Commission for Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration. We find that the cash payments received by FNL demobilized households had a positive impact on consumption, nonfood spending and investments. The program also generated positive spillovers in the villages where FNL combatants returned. Ex-combatants indeed spent a large part of their allowance on consumption goods and clothing, thereby generating a short-run economic boom in villages. However, the long-run evolution of consumption indicators is negative for CNDD-FDD households, as well as for villages where CNDD-FDD combatants returned, suggesting that the direct impact and the spillovers of the program vanished in the long run.","[D'Aoust, Olivia] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [D'Aoust, Olivia] ULB, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Sterck, Olivier] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England; [Verwimp, Philip] ULB, ECARES, Dev Econ, Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Oxford; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Sterck, O (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Oxford, England.",odaoust@worldbank.org; olivier.sterck@economics.ox.ac.uk; wimp@ulb.ac.be,,,Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS); ARC [09/14-018]; MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework),Alain and Marie Philippson Chair; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); ARC(Australian Research Council); MICROCON project (EU 6th Framework)(European Union (EU)),"Olivia D'Aoust and Philip Verwimp acknowledge financial support from the Alain and Marie Philippson Chair and the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS).

The results reveal a perceptible difference in labor migration among adult children whose parents are just above and below the age of pension eligibility: The adult children with a parent just attaining the pension-eligible age are more likely to be labor migrants compared with those with a parent just below the pension-eligible age. We also find that with a pension-eligible parent, the adult children are more likely to have off-farm jobs. These abrupt changes in household behavior at the cutoff suggest that these households are credit constrained. In addition, we find that the pension's effect on migration is greater among adult children with a parent in poor health; pension-eligible elderly report that they are more likely to use inpatient services when needed and less likely to rely on adult children for care when they are ill. These results suggest that (expectations regarding) providing care for elderly parents has constrained labor migration from China's rural areas to some extent, and that the new rural pension program has helped to relax this constraint.","[Eggleston, Karen] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sun, Ang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA USA",Stanford University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Tsinghua University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Sun, A (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",karene@stanford.edu; ang.sun@gmail.com; zhanzhg@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","The research for this article was financed by the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University.

Using a new dataset on tax revenues for 130 countries between 1792 and 2006, we identify ninety-nine episodes of trade liberalization defined as a large fall in trade tax revenues not accompanied by a decrease in trade. Seven took place before World War One, seven in the interwar period, eighteen in the Bretton Woods period and the remainder after 1970. We examine the extent to which countries were able to recover the tax revenues lost by liberalizing trade by using other sources of revenue. We find that historical (pre-1970) trade liberalization episodes were unlikely to be accompanied by decreases in tax revenues, especially during the Bretton Woods era. In the recent period however, over 40% of the developing countries in our sample experience a fall in total tax revenues that lasts more than ten years after an episode of trade liberalization. Overall, trade liberalization led to larger and longer-lived declines in tax revenues in developing countries since 1970 than in today's rich countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Results are similar when we consider government expenditures, suggesting decreases in trade tax revenues negatively affect governments' capacity to provide public services in many developing countries.","[Cage, Julia] Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Cage, Julia; Gadenne, Lucie] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Gadenne, Lucie] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Warwick,"Cagé, J (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.;Cagé, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",julia.cage@sciencespo.fr; l.gadenne@warwick.ac.uk,"Cagé, Julia/AAA-1522-2019","Cagé, Julia/0000-0001-7085-5774",ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,93,55,57,1,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

But very little is known about the heterogeneous impacts of innovation on exports. Since innovation is not a costless activity, it is relevant to know the specific situations in which a firm most likely needs to innovate to raise its exports. Using data from Chile, we combine information on innovation activities at the firm level with a rich dataset on exports at the transaction level. We find that the firms that engage in innovation tend to export more than other firms because they are able to sell goods and target markets that reward innovation. We show that the goods and markets in which innovative exporters outperform non-innovative exporters are those where innovation can lead to substantial differences in terms of quality. Innovative firms do not have an edge in exporting goods and in targeting markets that do not reward innovation. In particular, innovative firms do not outperform non-innovative firms when exporting goods and penetrating markets in which differentiation in terms of quality is not possible or not relevant.","[Blyde, Juan; Mussini, Micaela] Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA; [Iberti, Gonzalo] Chilean Minist Finance, Santiago, Chile",Inter-American Development Bank,"Blyde, J (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA.",juanbl@iadb.org,,,,,,,28,12,12,4,28,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper proposes a new parametric approach to estimate the aggregate spatial effect of multiple heterogeneous sites while providing fruitful interpretations of the effect of each of these sites. While the proposed method is developed based on a traditional accessibility measure, the way in which it addresses the role of the proximity order of sites in the spatial analysis is novel. The method is applied empirically using rental housing data in Tokyo, Japan to examine how the clustering of train and subway stations influences the rental prices in their vicinity. The results reveal a discounting impact of the order of each station's proximity, even after controlling for the effect of distance. In addition, the results reveal that using a traditional accessibility measure without considering the proximity order leads to serious estimation biases. The proposed methodology is applicable to various spatial topics, such as transportation, neighborhood externalities and polycentric urban structures.","[Sadayuki, Taisuke] Waseda Univ, Res Inst Environm Econ & Management, Shinjuku Ku, Nishiwaseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Sadayuki, Taisuke] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, 607 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Waseda University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sadayuki, T (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Res Inst Environm Econ & Management, Shinjuku Ku, Nishiwaseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.;Sadayuki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, 607 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tai.sadayuki@gmail.com,,"Sadayuki, Taisuke/0000-0003-4733-1299","CSIS, University of Tokyo [470]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP17H07181]","CSIS, University of Tokyo; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is a revised version of a chapter in the author's doctoral dissertation.

The framework is similar to that of Hausman and Newey (Econometrica, 1995, 63, 1445-1476), but allows for more general forms of heterogeneity. Individual demands are characterized by a general model that is nonparametric in the regressors, as well as monotonic in unobserved heterogeneity, allowing us to identify the distribution of welfare effects. We first argue why a decision maker should care about this distribution. Then we establish constructive identification, propose a sample counterparts estimator, and analyze its large-sample properties. Finally, we apply all concepts to measuring the heterogeneous effect of a change of gasoline price using US consumer data and find very substantial differences in individual effects across quantiles.","[Hoderlein, Stefan] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Vanhems, Anne] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Boston College; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Hoderlein, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",stefan_hoderlein@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,4,4,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

It was massive in scale, discrete in timing and exogenous to firms and consumers in the textile industry. Since the MFA quota removal did not affect all textile products at the same time, we are able to use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of the MFA. Using transaction-level data from the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics over the period 2000-06, we find that the MFA removal reduced average export prices by about 25%. This fall was mainly caused by a combination of the entry of new low-price exporters and new low-price products, rather than a fall in prices of existing firm-product combinations. We also find that price reductions are twice as large for heterogeneous than for homogeneous products.","[Bernhofen, Daniel] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy GEP, Nottingham, England; [Wang, Zheng] De Montfort Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leicester, Leics, England",American University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; De Montfort University,"Bernhofen, D (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wang, Zheng/0000-0001-6276-1831",,,,,19,5,5,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2983,3000,,10.1111/twec.12581,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000450129200007,0

After briefly discussing some significant EU treaties that serve as the background materials, it presents the key arguments advocated by the leave and remain camps. The economic impact depends critically on the negotiation outcomes. Aside from the debate on the divorce costs, there are numerous issues that must be negotiated, such as immigration, trade in goods, services, agriculture, fisheries and financial regulations. We discuss various scenarios of possible new trade regimes, resulting in different impacts on the UK economy. With each side having its bargaining chips to play, the trade-offs between give and take in the negotiation game are analysed. Considering various strategic options, this paper urges rationality and cooperation, especially weighing both sides' entwined economic interests, in addition to their mutual security, defence, environmental and world concerns. The potential gains and losses in the event where the UK contemplates new trade arrangements with the non-EU countries are analysed in the Appendix.","[Chang, Winston W.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Chang, WW (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023","Chang, Winston/0000-0003-2561-8424",Center for European Studies (CEUS); Baldy Center,Center for European Studies (CEUS); Baldy Center,"This paper was presented at the Brexit Roundtable Discussion on 10 April 2017, SUNY at Buffalo, organised by Jean Monnet Chair Deborah Reed-Danahay and co-sponsored by The Center for European Studies (CEUS) and The Baldy Center.

Economic developers have initiated a great deal of policies to promote clusters and encourage technological advancement. Despite the efforts of previous studies to quantify the cluster innovation relationship, they failed to differentiate two major mechanisms, such as learning (firms improving in clusters) and selection (less innovative firms being forced out of clusters). This study differentiates and quantifies learning and selection using nonparametric estimation and quantile regression. Using employment and establishment data as well as patent data from Maryland from the years 2001 to 2012, this study detects both mechanisms in information technology clusters. Learning in clusters increases patent filing by 15.7% to 17.2% for firms that have ever filed for patents. At the same time, firms filing fewer than one patent per year are 40% less likely to survive in clusters than they are in nonclusters.

At the same time, environmental awareness, new regulations for increased fuel efficiency, and the need to diminish greenhouse gas emissions make small vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles more competitive. As a consequence, vehicle characteristics and consumer decisions will change rapidly in the short and medium run. Accounting for the dynamic of the problem is important to correctly forecast green vehicle acceptance and to evaluate eco-friendly policies. This paper proposes a generalized dynamic discrete choice approach that models purchase behavior and forecasts future preferences in a finite time horizon setting. The framework allows one-time purchases, repeated purchases, univariate and multivariate diffusion processes that capture the evolution of vehicle characteristics and dynamics in the market conditions. The models proposed are estimated using stated preference data collected in Maryland. Results show that the formulation with repeated purchases successfully captures changes in the market shares, and that the multivariate diffusion process adopted to model the evolution of fuel prices further improves both model fit and the ability to recover peaks in demand. The estimated coefficients have been applied to test different policy scenarios, including changes in fuel prices, vehicle purchase prices, and improvements of car characteristics. These policies have a high impact on the adoption of electric cars and on their diffusion in the marketplace.","[Liu, Yan; Cirillo, Cinzia] Univ Maryland, 1179 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cirillo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, 1179 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ccirillo@umd.edu,,"Cirillo, Cinzia/0000-0002-5167-0413","National Science Foundation [1131535]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1131535] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant N. 1131535.

Given these identified policy shocks, we quantify the relative importance of different transmission channels via counterfactual analysis. Our results suggest a nontrivial role for the bank-lending channel at the aggregate level, but its importance has been greatly diminished since the early 1980s. Despite the timing, we find no support for a link between this change in the transmission mechanism and the concurrent reduction in output volatility associated with the Great Moderation. There is, however, some evidence of a link to the reduction in inflation volatility occurring at the same time.","[Endut, Norhana] Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Morley, James] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tien, Pao-Lin] Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20233 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Tien, PL (通讯作者)，Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",Pao-Lin.Tien@bea.gov,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747","Economics Department at Wesleyan University; Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy at Washington University in St. Louis","Economics Department at Wesleyan University; Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy at Washington University in St. Louis","The authors would like to thank Steve Fazzari, Tom King, Jeremy Piger, and participants at conferences and seminars where we presented this paper for helpful comments and discussions.

Using these assumptions, we present empirical analysis of the effect of RTC laws on violent and property crimes in Virginia, Maryland, and Illinois. Imposing specific assumptions that we believe worthy of consideration, we find that RTC laws increase some crimes, decrease other crimes, and have effects that vary over time for others.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Pepper, John V.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Northwestern University; University of Virginia,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,25,52,65,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Bayesian calculations are easily implemented, because all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. The proposed Gibbs sampler provides the basis for a stepwise re-estimation procedure that ensures non-crossing quantiles.

We measure pricing efficiency at the firm level using variance ratios calculated from quote midpoints in the TAQ database. We find four main results. First, on average, the market is efficient, with variance ratios close to one. However, in any given year, there is considerable cross-sectional variation in variance ratios, suggesting at least some firms are priced inefficiently. Second, higher institutional ownership by active institutional investors is related to better pricing efficiency, while passive ownership does not reduce pricing efficiency. Third, REITs that are included in the S&P 500 and S&P 400 are priced more efficiently than other REITs. For the S&P 500 firms, we find evidence that this was purely driven by sample selection, while for S&P 400 firms, we find evidence that it is inclusion in the index that drives efficiency. Finally, we find evidence that firm investment, analyst coverage and debt capital raising activity can influence pricing efficiency.","[Aguilar, Mike] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Boudry, Walter I.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Cornell SC Johnson Coll Business, Ithaca, NY USA; [Connolly, Robert A.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Dept Finance, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Cornell University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Aguilar, M (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",maguilar@email.unc.edu; wb242@cornell.edu; robert_connolly@unc.edu,,,,,,,42,15,15,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2018,46.0,1,,,,,251,283,,10.1111/1540-6229.12210,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FW8OK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000425595600007,0

Since self-employment can aid regional economies, if such a relationship holds at the state level, insurance regulation may bolster state economic development. Yet such regulations may spawn high insurance premiums, which can depress self-employment. This study tested whether state self-employment rates from 2009 to 2011 related positively to states' use of guaranteed issue mandates in the individual and small group markets from 2008 to 2010. These mandates require insurers to offer coverage to all applicants. Self-employment rates are measured as the share of the nonagricultural labor force self-employed, and alternately as the number of individual proprietorships per 1,000 population. Both measures are statistically higher in states that mandate guaranteed issue for groups of one in the small-group market than in states that do not; however, they are insensitive to individual market-guaranteed issue and inversely related to premiums.","[Chattopadhyay, Jacqueline] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Chattopadhyay, J (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",jchattop@uncc.edu,,,,,,,103,0,0,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Although numerous academic papers have applied SD models to real estate markets over the past generation, the technique remains relatively unknown and little used both in the academic economics literature and, more to the point, among practitioners and educators in the real estate community. Yet SD has the potential to address key needs among these constituencies, and extend and complement upon traditional economic methods. SD models are focused on modeling market transitions toward long-run equilibria, facilitating the study of the details of causality and the dynamic path of the market and features that are prominent in the history of housing markets in emerging markets. Different from intensive data-driven economic models, SD models are structural-based operational models that can more easily accommodate the actual non-market features and unique institutional components of these emerging real estate markets, where long-range historical data are not readily available. SD can provide intuitive and transparent model structures that should be able to improve pedagogy for educating large numbers of potential real estate entrepreneurs particularly in emerging market countries. For demonstration, in the present paper we choose to focus on the China-specific features of speculative demand' and land financing scheme', and use the newly developed SD model to explore the effects of land supply, command-and-control versus market-driven policies for housing in China. It is important to note, however, that while we chose China for the purposes of our study, the same technique can be applied to any emerging real estate market. Moreover, our research here can be seen as a stepping stone: Before a generalized SD model for emerging markets can be developed, it is both reasonable and appropriate to construct a model that is constrained to a manageable subset of the overall market space.","[Zhang, Xin; Geltner, David; de Neufville, Richard] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Xin; Geltner, David; de Neufville, Richard] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhang, X (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",xinzhang@mit.edu,,,,,,,42,13,14,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Since the fall of 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada, was added to the ever-growing list of metropolises with such ride-hailing companies (RHCs). For cities whose economies are built predominately on the foundations of tourism, questions inevitably have been raised regarding the effects that RHCs have on their respective transportation system operators, in particular, the taxicab industry. In Las Vegas, services such as Uber (Uber Technologies Inc.) and Lyft (Lyft.com) compete directly with the taxicab industry for riders within the resort corridor and across the valley. In this study, a multinomial linear regression analysis used a multi-modal, time-series travel dataset to estimate the effects of RHCs on taxicab ridership. After controlling for a number of explanatory variables, including the total number of monthly visitors, transit ridership, ride-hailing trip counts to/from the airport and several other socioeconomic indicators, the results showed that RHCs do in fact have a negative, and significant, effect on taxicab ridership. A perhaps more profound and counterintuitive finding however was that transit ridership along the resort corridor actually complements (rather than competes with) taxi ridership; this could have significant implications moving forward.","[Contreras, Seth D.] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Paz, Alexander] Univ Nevada, Transportat Res Ctr, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn Civil & Environm Engn, 4505 Maryland Pkwy,POB 454007, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Contreras, SD (通讯作者)，World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",Seth.Contreras@WRI.org; apaz@UNLV.edu,,"Paz, Alexander/0000-0002-1217-9808",,,,,26,97,110,2,64,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The importance of positive and negative votes in calculating a candidate's net score may be different, so that a negative vote and a positive vote need not cancel out exactly. These rules combine the first-place seeking incentives of plurality with the incentives to avoid being ranked last of antiplurality. We show that, in our simple model, arbitrary best-worst rules admit equilibria, which (except for three candidates) are nonconvergent if and only if the importance of a positive vote exceeds that of a negative vote. The set of equilibria in the latter case is very similar to that of plurality, except the platforms are less extreme due to the moderating effect of negative votes. Moreover: (i) any degree of dispersion between plurality, at one extreme, and full convergence, at the other, can be attained for the correct choice of the weights; and, (ii) when they exist (and there are at least five candidates), there always exist nonconvergent equilibria in which none of the most extreme candidates receive the most electoral support.","[Cahan, Dodge] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Slinko, Arkadii] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Auckland,"Cahan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",dcahan@ucsd.edu; a.slinko@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2018,51.0,2,,,,,259,279,,10.1007/s00355-018-1115-7,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GO4YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000440023800004,0

This paper investigates whether or not the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) impacted local preferences for Arab neighbors. We test for changes in preferences using a differences-indifferences approach in a hedonic pricing model. Relative to sales before 9/11, we find properties within 0.1 miles of an Arab homeowner sold at a 1.4% discount (approximately $4133) in the 180 days after 9/11. The results are robust to a number of specifications including time horizon, event date, distance, time, alternative ethnic groups, and the presence of nearby mosques. Previous research has shown price effects at neighborhood levels but has not identified effects at the micro or individual property level, and for good reason: most transaction level data sets do not include ethnic identifiers. Applying methods from the machine learning and biostatistics literature, we develop a binomial classifier using a supervised learning algorithm and identify Arab homeowners based on the name of the buyer. We train the binomial classifier using names from Summer Olympic Rosters for 221 countries during the years 1948-2012. We demonstrate the flexibility of our methodology and perform an interesting counterfactual by identifying Hispanic and Asian homeowners in the data; unlike the statistically significant results for Arab homeowners, we find no meaningful results for Hispanic and Asian homeowners following 9/11.","[Nowak, Adam] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 Univ Dr,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Sayago-Gomez, Juan] Univ Icesi, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ Studies, Cali, Colombia",West Virginia University; Universidad ICESI,"Nowak, A (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 Univ Dr,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",adam.d.nowak@gmail.com; jtsayago@icesi.edu.co,"Sayago, Juan Tomas/JJF-0023-2023","Sayago, Juan Tomas/0000-0002-7238-124X",,,,,54,5,8,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Rather than attempting to identify the true specification, the GFIC chooses from a set of potentially misspecified moment conditions and parameter restrictions to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of a user-specified target parameter. The intent of the GFIC is to formalize a situation common in applied practice. An applied researcher begins with a set of fairly weak baseline assumptions, assumed to be correct, and must decide whether to impose any of a number of stronger, more controversial suspect assumptions that yield parameter restrictions, additional moment conditions, or both. Provided that the baseline assumptions identify the model, we show how to construct an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the asymptotic MSE to select over these suspect assumptions: the GFIC. We go on to provide results for postselection inference and model averaging that can be applied both to the GFIC and various alternative selection criteria. To illustrate how our criterion can be used in practice, we specialize the GFIC to the problem of selecting over exogeneity assumptions and lag lengths in a dynamic panel model, and show that it performs well in simulations. We conclude by applying the GFIC to a dynamic panel data model for the price elasticity of cigarette demand.","[Chang, Minsu; DiTraglia, Francis J.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"DiTraglia, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",fditra@sas.upenn.edu,,"DiTraglia, Francis/0000-0002-5924-7740",,,,,20,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

B.",,,Sequentially testing polynomial model hypotheses using power transforms of regressors,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NUISANCE PARAMETER,"We provide a methodology for testing a polynomial model hypothesis by generalizing the approach and results of Baek, Cho, and Phillips (Journal of Econometrics, 2015, 187, 376-384; BCP), which test for neglected nonlinearity using power transforms of regressors against arbitrary nonlinearity. We use the BCP quasi-likelihood ratio test and deal with the new multifold identification problem that arises under the null of the polynomial model. The approach leads to convenient asymptotic theory for inference, has omnibus power against general nonlinear alternatives, and allows estimation of an unknown polynomial degree in a model by way of sequential testing, a technique that is useful in the application of sieve approximations. Simulations show good performance in the sequential test procedure in both identifying and estimating unknown polynomial order. The approach, which can be used empirically to test for misspecification, is applied to a Mincer (Journal of Political Economy, 1958, 66, 281-302; Schooling, Experience and Earnings, Columbia University Press, 1974) equation using data from Card (in Christofides, Grant, and Swidinsky (Eds.), Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp, University of Toronto Press, 1995, 201-222) and Bierens and Ginther (Empirical Economics, 2001, 26, 307-324). The results confirm that the standard Mincer log earnings equation is readily shown to be misspecified. The applications consider different datasets and examine the impact of nonlinear effects of experience and schooling on earnings, allowing for flexibility in the respective polynomial representations.","[Cho, Jin Seo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonse Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Cho, Jin Seo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

How generous is disputed. Based on standard finance theory and recommendations from the OECD and the IMF, the value that firms attach to future deductions depends on the risks of these, and the companies' after-tax weighted-average cost of capital cannot be applied directly. As an example, a simple model quantifies the difference between pre-tax and post-tax systematic risk when tax deductions are less risky than pre-tax cash flows. Osmundsen et al. (2015) suggest that the difference must be ignored by oil companies, since they cannot find the separate market values of tax deductions. But companies operating in different jurisdictions cannot then appreciate differences in tax systems, not even approximately, which will lead to suboptimal decisions. Tax designers may instead assume that companies have gradually adopted more sophisticated methods of investment decision making.","[Davis, Graham A.] Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Earth Resources, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Davis, Graham A.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Lund, Diderik] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway",Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; University of Oslo,"Davis, GA (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Earth Resources, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Davis, GA (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",gdavis@mines.edu; diderik.lund@econ.uio.no,,,Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Lund was a member of the Norwegian public commission on petroleum taxation 1999-2000, but has not participated in the Ministry's work with subsequent reforms of the system.

We build a unique microregional data set of 452 Prussian counties for 1816 to 1821 and 1869 to 1871, when religiousness was still pervasive. Exploiting the concentric dispersion of Protestantism around Wittenberg, our instrumental variable model finds that Protestantism had a substantial positive effect on suicide. Results are corroborated in first-difference models. Tests relating to the two mechanisms based on historical church attendance data and modern suicide data suggest that the sociological channel plays the more important role.","[Becker, Sascha O.] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Becker, Sascha O.] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Becker, Sascha O.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Becker, Sascha O.] IZA, Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] IZA, CESifo, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] CAGE, Munich, Germany",University of Warwick; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Becker, SO (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Becker, SO (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.;Becker, SO (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Becker, SO (通讯作者)，IZA, Munich, Germany.",,"Vieira de Souza, M.Alexandre/CAH-8316-2022; Becker, Sascha O./B-2463-2012","Vieira de Souza, M.Alexandre/0000-0002-5626-5898; /0000-0002-0672-4865",Pact for Research and Innovation of the Leibniz Association; German Science Foundation [CRC TRR 190]; ESRC Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (ESRC) [ES/L011719/1]; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Pact for Research and Innovation of the Leibniz Association; German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ESRC Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (ESRC); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor, three referees, Ran Abramitzky, Robert Barro, Gary Becker, Davide Cantoni, Francesco Cinnirella, Carl-Johan Dalgaard, Angus Deaton, Luca De Benedictis, Ray Fisman, Jon Gruber, Gordon Hanson, Dan Hungerman, Larry Iannaccone, Murat Iyigun, Andrew Oswald, Jared Rubin, John Sawkins, Fabian Waldinger, and participants at several seminars for helpful discussion and comments.

We further develop a Method of Successive Average (MSA)-based sequential optimization algorithm for large-scale evacuation problems. Both the proposed model and the solution algorithm are tested and validated through a set of numerical tests on a small network, and a detailed case study on the Lower Manhattan network.

The results generally indicate that MEP services have had positive and significant impacts on establishment productivity and sales per worker for the 2002 to 2007 period with some exceptions based on employment size, industry, and type of service provided. MEP services have also increased the probability of establishment survival for the 1997 to 2007 period. Regardless of econometric model specification, MEP clients with 1 to 19 employees have statistically significant and higher levels of labor productivity growth. The authors also observed significant productivity differences associated with MEP services by broad sector, with higher impacts over the 2002 to 2007 period in the durable goods manufacturing sector.

The method decomposes differences between an estimated transition matrix and a benchmark transition matrix into portions attributable to differences in characteristics between individuals from different households (a composition effect) and portions attributable to differing returns to these characteristics (a structure effect). A detailed decomposition based on copula theory further decomposes the composition effect into portions attributable to specific characteristics and their interactions. To examine potential drivers of economic persistence in the USA, we apply the method to white males from the 1979 US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Depending on the transition matrix entry of interest, differing characteristics between sons from different households explain between 40% and 70% of observed income persistence, with differing returns for these characteristics explaining the remaining gap. Further, detailed decompositions reveal significant heterogeneity in the role played by specific characteristics (e.g., education) across the income distribution.","[Richey, Jeremiah] Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Rosburg, Alicia] Univ Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, IA USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University of Northern Iowa,"Richey, J (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Jeremiah.richey@occ.treas.gov,,"Rosburg, Alicia/0000-0002-5116-0501",,,,,53,7,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Using a unique administrative data set containing the dates when information is exchanged between job seekers and caseworkers, we address three questions: Do information shocks, such as notification of future training, have an effect on unemployment duration? What is the joint effect of notification and training programs on unemployment? Can ignoring information shocks lead to a large bias in the estimation of the effect of training programs? We discuss these issues through the lens of a job search model and then conduct an empirical analysis following a random effects approach to deal with selectivity. We find that notification has a strong positive effect on the training probability but a negative one on the probability of leaving unemployment. This attraction effect highlights the importance of accounting for notifications in the evaluation of active labor market policies.","[Crepon, Bruno; van den Berg, Gerard J.] INSEE, CREST, Malakoff, France; [Crepon, Bruno; van den Berg, Gerard J.] J PAL, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ferracci, Marc] French Minist Labor, Paris, France; [Ferracci, Marc] Univ Paris II, Paris, France; [Ferracci, Marc] Paris Inst Polit Studies, Paris, France; [Jolivet, Gregory; van den Berg, Gerard J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] CEPR, London, England",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; University of Bristol; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"van den Berg, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",gerard.vandenberg@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,8,8,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

This paper argues that such policies have negative effects on net consumers of such products due to higher prices. With 70 percent of poor households' budget spent on food, and about 13 percent of the total budget devoted to products subject to import bans, poor households are vulnerable to such trade policies. Prices of some import prohibited food products are found to be higher than what they would be in the absence of such bans.

Although most previous studies have focused on retaliatory anti-dumping filings, in this paper we explore another potential avenue for strategic responsefiling a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement understanding. Using a panel of global anti-dumping filings between 1995 and 2011, we analyse under what conditions countries will choose to retaliate through either an anti-dumping petition or a WTO dispute, and to what degree these two strategies are complementary or act as substitutes. We find statistical evidence that countries are more likely to file a WTO dispute when they have also filed a retaliatory anti-dumping petition, suggesting that these two strategies may be complementary.","[Feinberg, Robert M.; Reynolds, Kara M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Feinberg, RM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853; Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,27,7,8,4,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1251,1268,,10.1111/twec.12601,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000432037100005,0

Existing research, however, does not typically consider methods that aim at theory generation. Current methods such as econometric modelling or structural equation modelling face challenges related to how causality is established due to potential issues regarding cross-sectional data sets. To address this gap, this paper suggests a total interpretive structural modelling based approach. We use graph theory logic to synthesize expert interpretations in the form of a theoretical supply chain model. This method may prove to be an alternative method to econometric based modelling or structural equation modelling.

First, it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for parameter identification, where the identifying information is provided by the first- and second-order properties of nonsingular submodels. Second, it provides a procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Third, it delivers confidence sets for structural parameters and impulse responses that allow for model misspecification. Fourth, it generates forecasts for all the observed endogenous variables, irrespective of the number of shocks in the model. The framework encompasses the conventional likelihood analysis as a special case when the model is nonsingular. It enables the researcher to start with a basic model and then gradually incorporate more shocks and other features, meanwhile confronting all the models with the data to assess their implications. The methodology is illustrated using both small- and medium-scale DSGE models. These models have numbers of shocks ranging between 1 and 7.","[Qu, Zhongjun] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,,,,,,45,4,5,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

First, we represent a national data set incorporating 16,850 crowd-shipping requests across the United States for the 2 year period of January 2015 through December 2016. Second, we develop a two-part model of supply defined by both the probability of receiving a bid from a crowd-courier, and the bid count. Model results along with elasticity measurements summarize the effects of variation in shipping request and package, built environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. Third, we report the sensitivity of elasticities over different segmentations to understand whether and to what extent the supply responsiveness varies across segments. Our results show that (1) supply is unevenly distributed across the U.S. at the block group level, (2) this geographical disparity is a function of not only the shipping request and service characteristics, but also the socioeconomic and built environment attributes, (3) the supply has denser pockets in areas with a higher percentage of African-American population, high wage workers, and families with two or more vehicles, (4) the supply peters off in areas with higher population and employment densities, while, it is accumulated in geographical areas with higher destination accessibility and regional employment diversity, and (5) the out-of-state and the business-to-customer shipments present the highest elasticity in receiving a bid, while posted requests with a delivery deadline is the most inelastic segment. Transportation planners and crowd-shipping companies can use these results to implement improved supply creation, geographically targeted growth, and price discrimination strategies.","[Ermagun, Alireza; Stathopoulos, Amanda] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Stathopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",alireza.ermagun@northwestern.edu; a-stathopoulos@northwestern.edu,"Stathopoulos, Amanda/GWM-4799-2022; Stathopoulos, Amanda/K-2386-2014",,US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant [1534138]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1534138] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),This material is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant No. 1534138 Smart CROwdsourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) System.

Using data from seventeen cities, we establish robust relationships between topography and density, income and housing value gradients. We find that high-income households display strong preference not only for higher altitude but also for unevenness, leading to spatial income stratification at both the city and tract-level. We analyze potential causes of this propensity: micro-climate, crime, congestion, view effects, and use of public transit. We conclude that multidimensional. spatial methods are crucial to investigations of cities with substantial unevenness. Moreover, redistributive social and economic policies must struggle with a fundamental, topographical dimension to inequality.","[Ye, Victor Yifan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Becker, Charles M.] Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Campus Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Boston University,"Becker, CM (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Campus Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",yifanye82@gmail.com; cbecker@duke.edu,"Becker, Charles/IWU-5480-2023",,,,,,34,5,5,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Scholars have tended to investigate the euro crisis from either a pragmatic and prescriptive perspective - asking which reforms are necessary to build legitimacy in the governance structure of the Eurozone - or an analytical perspective focused on the power wielding of actors useful for understanding what actors have done and why they have been influential or not. The paper argues that rather than bifurcating the issues of legitimacy and power politics, much may be gained by investigating the relationship between legitimacy and power. Specifically, the paper employs the concept of ideational power to analyze the strategies through which actors have sought to defend their claims to three constitutive dimensions of legitimacy - input, output and throughput legitimacy - and proposes a matrix of nine pathways to legitimation that played into processes of legitimacy battles in the Eurozone crisis.","[Carstensen, Martin B.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Schmidt, Vivien A.] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Sch Global Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carstensen, Martin B.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; Boston University; Copenhagen Business School,"Carstensen, MB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Carstensen, MB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",martinbc@gmail.com,,"Carstensen, Martin B./0000-0002-0432-1632","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks' [649456-ENLIGHTEN]","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks'","The research presented in the paper was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks.'

We adopt a test that does not require knowledge of the forecaster's prior information set and is robust to rational clustering, correlated forecast errors and outliers. We find that analysts forecast the PMI poorly and display multiple biases when forecasting. In particular, forecasters anti-herd and anti-anchor. Anti-herding supports a reputation-based notion that forecasters are rewarded not only for forecast accuracy but also for being the best forecast at a single point in time. Anti-anchoring is consistent with forecasters overreacting to private information. The two biases show a strong positive correlation suggesting that the incentives that elicit anti-herding also elicit anti-anchoring behavior. Both biases result in larger absolute errors, although the effect is stronger for anti-herding.","[Broughton, John B.] Chapman Univ, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Lobo, Bento J.] Univ Tennessee, 615 McCallie Ave, Chattanooga, TN 37403 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,"Lobo, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 615 McCallie Ave, Chattanooga, TN 37403 USA.",Broughto@chapman.edu; Bento-Lobo@utc.edu,,"Lobo, Bento/0000-0003-4000-9344",Argyros School of Business at Chapman University; College of Business at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,Argyros School of Business at Chapman University; College of Business at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Argyros School of Business at Chapman University and a summer research grant from the College of Business at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.,,34,2,2,1,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The estimation results show that the receipt of intergenerational transfers from parents and/or parents-in-law increases the likelihood of individuals leaving bequests to their children in both Japan and the United States, which in turn is likely to contribute to the persistence or widening of wealth disparities. However, such a tendency is found to be stronger among less better-off households in both countries, and this may help alleviate the disequalising effect of intergenerational transfers on the distribution of wealth, at least to some extent.","[Niimi, Yoko; Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan",National Bureau of Economic Research; Osaka University,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.",,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,"Asian Development Bank Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","Asian Development Bank Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The empirical work undertaken in this paper utilises microdata from the Preference Parameters Study of Osaka University's Twenty-first Century Center of Excellence Program, Behavioral Macrodynamics Based on Surveys and Experiments, and its Global Center of Excellence Project, Human Behavior and Socioeconomic Dynamics.

Using a dynamic stochastic model of urbanization with endogenous demand for property rights over land use, we demonstrate that the costly provision of those rights may result in both residential informality that can persist over time and suboptimal urbanization whereby cities are too small and insufficiently productive. In developing countries, because land administrations in charge of issuing titles are difficult to reform, achieving the second best may require acceptance of some level of informality in spite of the negative externalities stemming from informal land tenure and informal settlements. This may not be easily implemented as urban elites may favor overall welfare-reducing policies that over-evict informal dwellers.","[Cai, Yongyang] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Selod, Harris; Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Energy & Environm Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; The World Bank,"Selod, H (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Energy & Environm Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cai.619@osu.edu; hselod@worldbank.org; jsteinbuksr@worldbank.org,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196; Selod, Harris/0000-0002-0886-1265","National Science Foundation [SES-0951576, SES-1463644]; RDCEP project at the University of Chicago",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); RDCEP project at the University of Chicago,"We are grateful to the editor Yves Zenou, two anonymous referees, Gilles Duranton, Matthias Flueckiger, Jonathan Halket, Kenneth Judd, David Palmer, Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, Anthony Yezer and participants to the World Bank/George Washington University Urbanization and Poverty Reduction Research Conference, CSAE Annual Conference, Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, NARSC/UEA Annual Meetings, ISDG Conference on Dynamic Games and Game Theoretic Analysis, Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty and Hull Business School seminar for Useful Comments.

Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants.","[Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery; Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Pos Grad Ecol, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hawes, Joseph E.] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Biol, Appl Ecol Res Grp, East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; [Newton, Peter] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Sustainabil Energy & Environm Community, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Feltran-Barbieri, Rafael] World Resources Inst WRI Brasil, Rua Claudio Soares 72, BR-05422030 Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of East Anglia; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Anglia Ruskin University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Alves-Pinto, HN (通讯作者)，Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",h.alves-pinto@iis-rio.org,"Peres, Carlos A./ABE-8361-2020; Peres, Carlos Augusto/N-8275-2019","Peres, Carlos A./0000-0002-1588-8765; Newton, Peter/0000-0002-3992-0483; Hawes, Joseph/0000-0003-0053-2018",DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) [16-001]; Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK); Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),"This study was funded by a DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) grant (Ref. 16-001) to CAP, and supported by internal funding from Anglia Ruskin University to JEH.

We present a bioeconomic model that unpacks the role of soil biodiversity as contributing to both increasing and stabilizing agricultural productivity in low-input rainfed farming systems. The natural insurance value of soil biodiversity mostly depends on farmed risk preferences as well as on the frequency of drought events to be insured against. We show that when the probability of drought increases, soil biodiversity conservation can be an optimal ecosystem-based adaptation strategy. However, this is only likely to be the case up to a given drought probability threshold. The natural insurance value of soil biodiversity for climate change adaptation in drought prone rainfed agricultural systems depends on a combination of key hydrological, agronomic and economic parameters.","[Sidibe, Yoro] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Foudi, Sebastien; Pascual, Unai] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Termansen, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",The World Bank; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Foundation for Science; University of Copenhagen,"Foudi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sci Campus,Sede Bldg 1,Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain.",sebastien.foudi@bc3research.org,"Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019; Foudi, Sebastien/I-3466-2013","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; Termansen, Mette/0000-0003-4875-2810; Foudi, Sebastien/0000-0002-8013-7853","European Union Seventh Framework Programme [264 465]; Aarhus University, Department of Environmental Science, Denmark","European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Aarhus University, Department of Environmental Science, Denmark","This paper has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under the grant agreement no 264 465 (EcoFINDERS).

Several potential explanations exist, including low technological and demand complementarities; low productivity; and high natural and policy barriers to trade. Focusing on the latter explanations, policy makers have long advocated a South American/Southern Cone Free Trade Areaproposed as early as 1889. Would reductions in trade costs have been sufficient to raise trade significantly, or was trade low for other reasons? We study bilateral trade between 1910 and 1950, when large external shocks altered global supply and demand. These shocks help us show that intra-regional trade could have been boosted by reductions in trade costs. Trade among Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru could have benefited from more benign trade policies or better infrastructure. Regional trade in textiles, which took off from the 1930s, supports our argument that trade improved when trade costs fell.","[Badia-Miro, Marc; Carreras-Marin, Anna] Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni Capmany Econ & Hist Eco, Barcelona Econ Anal Team, Barcelona, Spain; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Barcelona; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Badia-Miró, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni Capmany Econ & Hist Eco, Barcelona Econ Anal Team, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Badia-Miró, Marc/D-8431-2011","Badia-Miró, Marc/0000-0001-5326-1819","Spanish Government; FEDER (Fondo Europeo para el Desarrollo Regional) [ECO2015-65049-C2-2-P, ECO2012-39169-C03-03]; Catalan Government [2014SGR1345]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); FEDER (Fondo Europeo para el Desarrollo Regional); Catalan Government,"The authors appreciate comments received from the editor and three anonymous referees.

Mechanized restoration treatments can improve forest health and reduce the likelihood of severe wildfire. These treatments produce some timber, and substantial amounts of forest residues that can be used to generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. Using the choice modeling method, this study investigates social preferences for generation of energy with woody biomass produced by restoration treatments on public forests in the Mountain West. Both multinomial logit and latent class logit (LCL) models are fit to the data and used to estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for increased amounts of woody biomass energy generation and important associated co-benefits and costs. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for the number of homes powered with wood, the extent of healthy forests, avoiding increases in the number of large wildfires, and local air quality. Significant heterogeneity was found in respondent preferences for the attributes. The heterogeneity can be explained in part by sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents. The LCL revealed four classes of respondents with distinct preferences, revealing conflicting viewpoints toward forest management for woody biomass energy generation.","[Campbell, Robert M.] Univ Montana, Econ, Liberal Arts Room 407,32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Campbell, Robert M.; Anderson, Nathaniel M.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 800 East Beckwith, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Venn, Tyron J.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia",University of Montana System; University of Montana; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Campbell, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Econ, Liberal Arts Room 407,32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",robert3.campbell@umontana.edu; tvenn@usc.edu.au; nathanielmanderson@fs.fed.us,,,"Biomass Research and Development Initiative, Competitive Grant, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2010-05325]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from NIFA under the Bioenergy Alliance Network of the Rockies (BANR) [2013-68005-21298]","Biomass Research and Development Initiative, Competitive Grant, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from NIFA under the Bioenergy Alliance Network of the Rockies (BANR)","This project was supported by the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, Competitive Grant no.; 2010-05325, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).

Deforestation cost studies have ignored the likelihood and possible economic impact of a forest-savanna critical transition, therefore underestimating the true social cost of deforestation. We explore the implications of a forest-savanna critical transition and propose an alternative framework for calculating the economic value of a standing tropical forest. Our framework is based on an average cost method, as opposed to currently used marginal cost methods, for the design of optimal land-use policy or payments for ecosystem services.

While the number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer outlets keeps growing, the value of direct-to-consumer sales has reached a plateau. At the same time, intermediated sales continue to rise. If consumers prefer to purchase local food through intermediated channels, then policies designed to support direct channels may be misguided. Using an online choice experiment, this paper investigates consumers' willingness to pay for local food differentiated by marketing channel. We find that, on average, consumers are willing to pay a premium for local food. However, they are not willing to pay premiums for local food that is sold at farmers markets, and discount it when it is purchased directly from an urban farm. Our findings can be used by farmers, marketers and policy makers to develop a better understanding of consumers' motivation for buying local through various channels.","[Printezis, Iryna; Grebitus, Carola] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Arizona State University,"Printezis, I (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",iiermole@asu.edu; carola.grebitus@asu.edu,,,"EASM-3: Collaborative Research: Physics-Based Predictive Modeling for Integrated Agricultural and Urban Applications, USDA-NIFA [2015-67003-23508]; NSF-MPS-DMS [1419593]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1419593] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","EASM-3: Collaborative Research: Physics-Based Predictive Modeling for Integrated Agricultural and Urban Applications, USDA-NIFA; NSF-MPS-DMS; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","The authors would like to thank Dr. Riccardo Scarpa for his helpful comments and suggestions to improve the experimental design of this article.

This paper analyses the effectiveness of a garbage tax, assessing its effects on multiple outcomes as well as its acceptability. We study how a Supreme Court decision, mandating the Swiss Canton of Vaud to implement a tax on garbage, affects garbage production and beliefs about the tax. We adopt a difference-in-differences approach exploiting that parts of Vaud already implemented a garbage tax before the mandate. Pricing garbage by the bag (PGB) is highly effective, reducing unsorted garbage by 40%, increasing recycling of aluminium and organic waste, without causing negative spillovers on adjacent regions. The effects of PGB seem very persistent over time. Our assessment of PGB looks very favourable. It may surprise that PGB is not implemented more often. Hence, we look at people's perceptions. We find that people are very concerned with PGB ex ante. Public opposition seems to be the main obstacle to PGB. However, implementing PGB reduces concerns with effectiveness and fairness substantially. After implementing PGB, people accept 70% higher garbage taxes compared to before PGB. We argue that environmental taxes could be much more diffused, if people had the chance to experience their functioning and correct their beliefs.","[Carattini, Stefano] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Baranzini, Andrea] HES SO Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Delemont, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, London, England; [Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Carattini, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",stefano.carattini@yale.edu,"Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019; Carattini, Stefano/AAK-5053-2021","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Carattini, Stefano/0000-0003-1242-2457; Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SKP1_165028]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SKP1_165028] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank Jeroen van den Bergh, Richard Blundell, Antoine Dechezlepretre, William Greene, Richard Howarth, Emilio Padilla, Jordi Roca, Frederic Vermeulen, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Similarly, the higher the mortgage depth in the country of ancestry, the higher the present value of the monthly mortgage payments. Our results suggest that social norms regarding mortgage finance in the country of ancestry matter in determining immigrants' mortgage finance in the host country. More specifically, the effect of social norms on the decision to have a mortgage (the extensive margin) and the amount of the mortgage payments (the intensive margin) is about one third and tenth the size of the effect of having a college degree on mortgage debt, respectively. Evidence of strong persistence of culture among those with longer tenure in the host country, those who immigrated as children or young adults, and second-generation immigrants suggests that vertical transmission of beliefs (from parents to children) is a plausible channel of transmission. Perhaps most importantly, we find that cultural attitudes regarding property rights are most relevant when explaining individuals' decision to get a mortgage, but those regarding credit information matter most when explaining the amount of the mortgage debt.","[Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria] Queens Coll, Dept Econ, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA",,"Rodríguez-Planas, N (通讯作者)，Queens Coll, Dept Econ, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA.",nuria.rodriguezplanas@qc.cuny.edu,"Rodriguez-Planaz, Nuria/AAF-6282-2021","Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria/0000-0003-3824-7001",Mellon Diversity Enhancement Research Grant from the Andrew W.

Previous studies aimed at addressing non-point source pollution have primarily analyzed the effectiveness of conservation practices (CPs) as land-management strategies. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these practices have not been compared to those of possible land-use changes. We develop a spatially explicit integrated modeling approach that compares the effectiveness and economic efficiency of alternative spatially optimal land-use and-management strategies for P abatement in the Sandusky River watershed. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and data on costs and profits from crop and forest production and urban development, we evaluated joint impacts on P reduction and economic-returns for optimized land-use changes and/or implementation of CPs in the watershed. Results showed a combination of both CPs and land-use changes are likely required to meet current abatement targets for dissolved reactive phosphorus. Additionally, the combination of these approaches can generate a positive, synergistic effect on economic efficiency in meeting key policy targets. This is largely because the combined strategy will establish CPs on the most productive cropland, while achieving greater nutrient reduction through land-use change away from corn-soybean rotations on less productive lands.","[Xu, Hui; Brown, Daniel G.; Moore, Michael R.; Currie, William S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Xu, H (通讯作者)，Argonne Natl Lab, Energy Syst Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.",xuhui@umich.edu,"Xu, Hui/K-6803-2019; Brown, Dan/L-8089-2013","Xu, Hui/0000-0003-2994-4892; Brown, Dan/0000-0001-6023-5950","National Science Foundation [1039043]; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1039043] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant number 1039043].,,70,28,32,1,93,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an eco-compensation program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). Eco-compensation is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.","[Bennett, Michael T.] 555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA; [Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhoongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane,Room 178, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Econ, Verona, Italy",Renmin University of China; Durham University; University of Waikato; University of Verona,"Bennett, MT (通讯作者)，555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA.",bennett.michaelt@gmail.com; ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009",,,,,,113,44,48,6,155,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We trace how specific understandings of equity figure centrally-although not always explicitly-in these expert visions. We find that understandings of equity in such vanguard visions are narrowly conceived as epistemic challenges, answerable by (more) scientific analysis. Major concerns about equity are treated as empirical matters, requiring scientific assessment of feasibility, risks, or win-win distributive outcomes and optimizations, with concurrent calls to delimit risk or reduce scientific uncertainties. We argue that such epistemic framings sidestep, inter alia, the inequality in resources available to diverse non-experts-including the vulnerable evoked in expert visions-to project their own equity perspectives onto imagined technological pathways of the future. These may include concerns relating to moral or historical responsibility and/or lack of agency in shaping the directions of innovation. We conclude that the performative power and political implications of specific expert visions of equity, evoked as a rationale to undertake solar geoengineering research, require continued scrutiny.","[Flegal, Jane A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Wageningen University & Research,"Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",jflegal@berkeley.edu; aarti.gupta@wur.nl,,"Gupta, Aarti/0000-0003-4908-7453",,,,,85,49,51,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

However, discussions surrounding the appropriate designs of spatial management have largely been conceptual. This paper develops a spatial econometric model of fishing location choice using non-confidential data from the Great Barrier Reef coral trout commercial fishery. Harvest location decisions are modeled as a function of spatial patterns of expected economic returns. The preferred spatially dependent econometric model is shown to outperform ordinary least squares and fixed effects models in out-of-sample forecasting. Estimates from the spatial model reveal spatial spillover effects in fleet harvest location behavior. In particular, harvest activity at any given site is equally sensitive to same-site economic returns and surrounding-site economic returns. The econometric results are illustrated using a fee-based policy simulation. Results suggest non spatial management is characterized by two inefficiencies. First, heterogeneity between sites is averaged, resulting a fee that is too high or too low across space. Second, fees that are too high or too low affect the fishing effort in nearby locations.","[Sampson, Gabriel S.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 305D Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Sampson, GS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 305D Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gsampson@ksu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [0801430] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"Research funding was provided by National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education #0801430, the Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT.

In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production. Since 79% of such crop production is not consumed in Arizona, it corresponds to exporting up to 67% of the water available in the state to the rest of the country and abroad. It has certain and glooming consequences on the availability of water for a state expected to see its population grow and its climate get drier. Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5% reduction in crop exports. Estimates indicate that the least costly solution is a more efficient irrigation system while export reduction is the second-best choice.","[Bae, Jinwon] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Dall'erba, Sandy] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dall'erba, Sandy] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Arizona; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Dall'erba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Dall'erba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dallerba@illinois.edu,"BAE, JINWON/AAM-6695-2020; Dall'erba, Sandy/AAR-3267-2020","Dall'erba, Sandy/0000-0002-1920-6100","USDA NIFA Hatch [1006816]; Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives; NIFA [1006816, 812788] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA NIFA Hatch; Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Financial support from USDA NIFA Hatch (grant 1006816) and from the Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives is gratefully acknowledged.",,55,33,35,2,73,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This article studies the impact of air pollution on pandemic mortality. The analysis combines a panel dataset on infant and all-age mortality with a novel measure of air pollution based on the burning of coal in a large sample of U.S. cities. We estimate that air pollution contributed significantly to pandemic mortality. Cities that used more coal experienced tens of thousands of excess deaths in 1918 relative to cities that used less coal with similar pre-pandemic socioeconomic conditions and baseline health. Factors related to poverty, public health, and the timing of onset also affected pandemic mortality. The findings support recent medical evidence on the link between air pollution and influenza infection, and suggest that poor air quality was an important cause of mortality during the pandemic.","[Clay, Karen; Severnini, Edson] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Lewis, Joshua] Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, 3150 Rue Jean Brillant, Montreal, PQ H3T 1N8, Canada",Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,"Clay, K (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",kclay@andrew.cmu.edu; joshua.lewis@umontreal.ca; ersevernini@gmail.com,,"Clay, Karen/0000-0003-3978-6656",Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago; Heinz College; Berkman Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago; Heinz College; Berkman Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,"We thank Martha Bailey, Antonio Bento, Christian Dippel, Walker Hanlon, Frank Lewis, and seminar participants at the 2015 NBER DAE Summer Meetings, the 2015 CNEH Meetings, the 2015 AERE Summer Conference, the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, McGill University, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Southern California for valuable comments and suggestions.

Economies of size were evident for plug flow and complete mix anaerobic digesters, which were more economically feasible on dairy farms than on swine operations. Methane production alone is not enough to provide positive net present values. On dairy farms, economic feasibility could be achieved by marketing co-products, but swine farms required government support to achieve positive NPVs.","[Cowley, Cortney; Brorsen, B.

However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future.","[Thompson, Wyatt; Gerlt, Scott] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Lu, Yaqiong; Yang, Xianyu; Kueppers, Lara M.] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, 5200 North Lake Rd,Sci & Engn 277, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Yang, Xianyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Campbell, J.

I document this using two types of evidence-use of econometric language in articles appearing in academic journals of economic history and economics; and publication histories of successive cohorts of Ph.D.s in the first decade since receiving the doctorate. Over time, economic history became more like economics in its use of econometrics and in the likelihood of scholars publishing in economics, as opposed to, say, economic history journals. But the pace of change was slower in economic history than in labor economics, another subfield of economics that underwent profound intellectual change in the 1950s and 1960s, and there was also a structural break evident for post-2000 Ph.D. cohorts. To account for these features of the data, I sketch a simple, overlapping generations model of the academic labor market in which junior scholars have to convince senior scholars of the merits of their work in order to gain tenure. I argue that the early cliometricians-most notably, Robert Fogel and Douglass North-conceived of a scholarly identity for economic history that kept the field distinct from economics proper in various ways, until after 2000 when their influence had waned.","[Margo, Robert A.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Margo, RA (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",margora@bu.edu,"Margo, Robert/GZH-1183-2022","Margo, Robert/0000-0003-2709-7490",,,,,26,22,23,2,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2018,12.0,3,,,,,377,406,,10.1007/s11698-018-0170-8,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GR4XE,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000442623500001,0

Likely driven by recent food crises, new bioenergy policies, and financial speculations, this phenomenon has been often investigated from the economic development, human right, land tenure and food security perspectives, while its hydrologic implications have remained understudied. It has been suggested that a major driver of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is the quest for water resources that can be used (locally) to sustain agricultural production in the acquired land. The appropriation of water resources associated with LSLAs has often been termed 'water grabbing', though to date a formal definition of such a normative and inherently pejorative term is missing. The intrinsic assumption is that the acquisition of water undergoes the same dynamics of unbalanced power relationships that underlie many LSLAs. Here we invoke hydrological theories of green and blue water flows to stress the extent to which water appropriations are inherently coupled to land acquisitions and specifically focus on blue water. We then propose a formal definition of blue water grabbing based both on biophysical conditions (water scarcity) and ethical implications (human right to food). Blue water grabs are appropriations of irrigation (i.e., blue) water in regions affected by undernourishment and where agricultural production is constrained by blue water availability.

In South Asia, CT has spread dramatically over the last decade, a result of strong policy support and increasing availability of appropriate machinery. Although many studies have analyzed the yield and profitability of CT systems, the technical efficiency impacts accrued by farmers utilizing CT have received considerably less attention. Employing a DEA framework, we isolated bias-corrected meta-frontier technical efficiencies and meta-technology ratios of three CT options adopted by wheat farmers in Bangladesh, including bed planting (BP), power tiller operated seeding (PTOS), and strip tillage (ST), compared to a control group of farmers practicing traditional tillage (TT). Endogenous switching regression was subsequently employed to overcome potential self-selection bias in the choice of CT, in order to robustly estimate efficiency factors. Among the tillage options studied, PTOS was the most technically efficient, with an average meta-technology ratio of 0.90, followed by BP (0.88), ST (0.83), and TT (0.67). The average predicted meta-frontier technical efficiency for the CT non-adopters under a counterfactual scenario (0.80) was significantly greater (P = 0.00) than current TE scores (0.65), indicating the potential for sizeable profitability increases with CT adoption. Conversely, the counterfactual TE of non-adopters was 23% greater than their DEA efficiency, also indicating efficiency gains from CT adoption. Our results provide backing for agricultural development programs in South Asia that aim to increase smallholder farmers' income through the application of CT as a pathway towards poverty reduction.","[Aravindakshan, Sreejith] Wageningen Univ, Farming Syst Ecol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Aravindakshan, Sreejith; Rossi, Frederick; Krupnik, Timothy J.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Rossi, Frederick] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Amjath-Babu, T.

Some label ES as boundary objects that help integrate diverse forms of knowledge across social groups and organizational scales. However, this classification masks complexities that arise from unique characteristics of ES types (i.e., provisioning, regulating, and cultural), which influence their ability to function as boundary objects. We argue that interpretive flexibility and material structures interact in distinct ways across ES types throughout a boundary object life cycle. Viewing a 2015 U.S. federal memorandum as a catalyst, we critically evaluate the evolution of ES and its role as a boundary object. We propose that provisioning and regulating services are transitioning out of boundary object status, moving into a more standardized state. However, we anticipate that cultural services may continue to behave as boundary objects if collaborators maintain them as such. This shift in the functionality of ES as boundary objects is an important consideration for future research that attempts to reach across social worlds and disciplinary perspectives. We urge collaborations to rely on the most relevant disciplinary knowledge, rather than allowing the ease of standardized solutions to dictate the boundary of a given problem. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this paper, we study the acquisition of supplemental irrigation water rights as an adaptation strategy undertaken by irrigation-dependent farmers in response to historical climate change. By exploiting the panel structure of a unique dataset of farm-level supplemental right adoption decisions in the state of Oregon, we establish a relationship between climate conditions, competition for local water resources, and the acquisition of supplemental rights. Our results indicate that a warmer, drier climate increases the likelihood that irrigated farms acquire supplemental rights, suggesting that farmers in Oregon have used supplemental rights to adapt to historical climate change. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects suggesting that junior irrigators, groundwater-dependent irrigators, and farmers with access to a relatively lower volume of water have been most affected by historical climate change with respect to their supplemental water right acquisition decisions.","[Bigelow, Daniel P.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Zhang, Hongliang] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Neuchatel,"Bigelow, DP (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",Daniel.bigelow@ers.usda.gov,,"Bigelow, Daniel/0000-0002-1154-2302","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The authors thank seminar and conference participants at the 2015 Southern Economic Association Annual Meetings, Oregon State University, and Economic Research Service for valuable feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

The authors claim that focusing attention on the micro-politics of PES design and implementation fails to expose an underlying neoliberal governmentality, and therefore only reinforces neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and solution of ecological crises. In response, we argue that a focus on the actions of local actors is key to understanding how and why such governmentality fails or succeeds in performing as theorized. Grand generalizations fixated on a particular hegemonic and neoliberal PES ontology overlook how actors intertwine theory and practice in ways which cannot be explained by a dominant structural theory:Such generalizations risk obscuring the complexity and situational history, practice and scale of the processes involved. Rather than relegating variegated and hybrid forms of what actually emerges from PES interventions as neoliberal conceit, we argue that an actor-oriented, 'weak theory' approach permits PES praxis to inform knowledge generation. This would open up a more inclusive and politically engaging space for thinking about and realizing political change.","[Van Hecken, Gert; Windey, Catherine; Huybrechs, Frederic; Bastiaensen, Johan] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Hecken, Gert; Bastiaensen, Johan] Cent Amer Univ, Res & Dev Inst Nitlapan, Managua 14003, Nicaragua; [Kolinjivadi, Vijay] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Temperate Forest Sci ISFORT, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [McElwee, Pamela] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, 55 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Shapiro-Garza, Elizabeth] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of Antwerp; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Duke University,"Van Hecken, G (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",gert.vanhecken@uantwerpen.be,"Windey, Catherine/K-3862-2015; McElwee, Pamela/AAP-1695-2020; Huybrechs, Frederic/I-8059-2015","McElwee, Pamela/0000-0003-3525-9285; Huybrechs, Frederic/0000-0002-6430-3444; Bastiaensen, Johan/0000-0002-1369-8570","Genome Canada; Genome Quebec under the ATRAPP project [10512]; Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec under the Innov'action Programme [IA116637]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2017-1078]; National Science Foundation from the Geography & Regional Sciences directorate [11028793]","Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome Quebec under the ATRAPP project; Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec under the Innov'action Programme; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Science Foundation from the Geography & Regional Sciences directorate","We thank the four anonymous reviewers for their detailed and constructive comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

In this regard, it is fundamental to design appropriate models to minimize the social costs of response operations to distribute essential supplies to populations in need. In addition to merely cover logistics cost, social costs include deprivations costs, which are an increasing function of deprivation time, derived from the human suffering caused by the lack of access to a good or a service. This research uses the theory of discrete choices to assess deprivation costs due to the time spent waiting for the delivery of a basket of basic supplies, defined as the changes in the welfare of people affected by disasters. To this end, we designed a stated choice survey, applied to people living in areas affected by floods and earthquakes in Colombia. The estimated models consider the influence of individual's socioeconomic characteristics and random effects on the deprivation cost functions. The functions have a nonlinear structure, strictly increasing, and convex on the deprivation time. The results are useful for estimating the social costs of humanitarian relief operations.

To fill in this gap, we develop a methodology based on financial networks, which allows for analyzing the transmission throughout the economy of positive or negative shocks induced by the introduction of specific climate policies. We apply the methodology to empirical data of the Euro Area to identify the feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy both through direct and indirect chains of financial exposures across multiple financial instruments. By focusing on climate policy-induced shocks that affect directly either the banking sector or non-financial firms, we analyze the reinforcing feedback loops that could amplify the effects of shocks on the financial sector and then cascade on the real economy.

The application of hydro-economic analysis to mining regions, however, is limited. This paper examines why this is the case and how to confront it. The paper focuses on identifying and describing features of large-scale mines and mine regions that are challenging to analyse such as: magnitude of capital involved, time-scale and remoteness of projects, inherent environmental risks, and strong negative perceptions about mining's impacts on water. These characteristics may limit the applicability of established hydro-economic concepts and methods, thus risk-based metrics are discussed as complementary tools. We also contend that further research and development in water-related ecosystem services should be a priority, in order to better quantify trade-offs between the economic benefits of water use by mining and competing users, including environmental flows. Case studies of mining regions in Chile, Madagascar and Sweden are summarised to illustrate some of the issues raised. While data limitations are an obstacle, new and extended case studies are required to explore how the challenges may be addressed.","[Ossa-Moreno, Juan; McIntyra, Neil; Keir, Greg] Univ Queensland, Ctr Water Minerals Ind, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Delaware, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Smarts, James C.

Although a stylized framework, the inclusion of native species permits analysis of trade-offs between the management actions of invasive species control and of habitat restoration for a range of settings and species characteristics. In general, more aggressive invasive species and more invasion-susceptible ecosystems require greater investment in habitat restoration despite its relative expense. Explicitly modeling invasion strategies reveals that the specific ecological mechanism of invasion defines the location of management activities in the river network, and the choice between invasive species control and habitat restoration. The analysis of this bioeconomic model develops insights that help managers to harness the power of native-invasive species establishment interactions in stemming bio-invasions across time and space.","[Albers, Heidi J.; Dietterich, Thomas G.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Hall, Kim Meyer] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lee, Katherine D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Taleghan, Majid Alkaee] Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Wyoming; Oregon State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Oregon State University,"Albers, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jo.albers@uwyo.edu; kim.hall@oregonstate.edu; Icatherinelee@uidaho.edu; alkaee@eecs.oregonstate.edu; tgd@eecs.oregonstate.edu,,"Albers, Heidi J/0000-0002-3775-7870; Dietterich, Thomas/0000-0002-8223-8586; Lee, Katherine/0000-0002-5267-0474","National Science Foundation [0832804, 1331932]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [0832804] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1331932, 1521687] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (0832804, 1331932).",,44,8,9,4,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

When findings of such assessments become part of political and scholarly controversies, they can be interpreted in unintended ways. The value of the ensuing debate is enhanced by a shared understanding of key concepts, methodological approaches, and evaluative criteria. Here we illustrate the importance of such shared understanding by example of a recent controversy surrounding the estimated impacts of decentralized zoning on deforestation in a major agricultural frontier, the Argentine Dry Chaco. In a recent analysis, we concluded that provincial zoning plans had significantly reduced deforestation in three provinces; critics suggest it had not. In attempting to resolve this debate, we identify six areas in which shared understanding can support more productive interaction. These include: (1) the distinction between impact and other measures of effectiveness, (2) an appreciation of recent advances in methods for causal inference, (3) the distinction between effective and perfect enforcement, (4) the challenge of attributing impacts to mechanisms and actors, (5) transparency in standards used to judge the desirability of observed outcomes, as well as (6) caution in the generalization of findings to other geographies.","[Nolte, Christoph] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 665 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gobbi, Beatriz; Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, 3 Pl Louis Pasteur, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Gobbi, Beatriz] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Inst Study Int Dev, 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria] Natl Univ Tucuman, Inst Reg Ecol, Edificio Copulas, Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina; [Butsic, Van] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 231 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Boston University; Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven; McGill University; McGill University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Nolte, C (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, 685 Commonwealth Av, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",chrnolte@bu.edu; beatriz.gobbi@uclouvain.be; yann.lepolaindewaroux@mcgill.ca; maria.piquer-rodriguez@geo.hu-berlin.de; vanbutsic@berkeley.edu; elambin@stanford.edu,"Piquer-Rodríguez, María/H-5589-2019; Nolte, Christoph/K-1692-2019; le Polain, Yann/N-2554-2016; Nolte, Christoph/D-8089-2019","le Polain, Yann/0000-0001-9887-7270; Nolte, Christoph/0000-0001-7827-689X; Lambin, Eric/0000-0002-0673-5257; Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria/0000-0001-8181-5049","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Palo Alto, CA [426]","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Palo Alto, CA","We thank three anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.

Unlike shakeouts in automobiles, tyres, or televisions, the commercial airframe industry's early life cycle was affected by external factors, particularly government demand. Using newly digitized data on all planes introduced in the commercial market between 1926 and 1965, we find that commercial airframe manufacturers with bomber contracts during the Second World War were more likely to have postwar market share than firms without such contracts, controlling for plane characteristics and other forms of government contracting. We attribute the effect of bomber contracts to advantages in R&D learning capacity acquired by firms with military airframe contracts. Despite low (or zero) initial presence in the commercial market, these learning capacity advantages allowed such firms to survive the early period of the shakeout, and later to thrive.","[Jaworski, Taylor] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Smyth, Andrew] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Queens University - Canada; Marquette University,"Jaworski, T (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,39,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

One way to address agriculture's impact during droughts is to use recycled water for irrigation, but little is known about how consumers will respond to information disclosing that a food product was produced with recycled water. On the positive side, irrigation with recycled water is environmentally friendly. On the negative side, there is an ick factor that might repel consumers. We conducted a framed field experiment to evaluate consumers' responses to California and French wines made from grapes produced with recycled, conventional, and an unspecified type of water for irrigation. We find that consumers prefer not to know; their willingness to pay is greatest when the wine is made from grapes irrigated with an unspecified type of water.

Carbon pricing can play a key role in meeting this objective. A cap-and-permit system, or alternatively a carbon tax indexed to a fixed emission-reduction trajectory, not only can spur cost-effective mitigation and cost-reducing innovation, but also, crucially, can ensure that emissions are held to the target level. The carbon prices needed to meet this constraint are likely to be considerably higher, however, than existing prices and conventional measures of the social cost of carbon.

They filter phytoplankton from water and thereby reduce nutrients, the primary driver of eutrophication of water that can consequently harm human health. Yet, where they can provide the most ecosystem benefit is in highly eutrophic waters and being raised in these 'polluted' waters may be an unattractive attribute for consumers. In this research, we use revealed-preference dichotomous-choice field experiments to test if and under what pollution mitigation circumstances oyster consumers will pay price premiums for oysters. The results from 290 adult participants in the Mid-Atlantic of the US suggest that providing information about eutrophication and oysters' ability to filter nutrients increases participants' WTP price premiums for oysters from low-nutrient waters and decreases their WTP price premiums for oysters from eutrophic waters with more nutrients. These results illustrate an important tension in how best to market green products like oysters, as the situations where they provide the most ecosystem benefits (in eutrophic waters) are also situations, which appear to raise the highest level of concerns among consumers. These results have implications on whether oysters should be actively marketed as a green product.","[Kecinski, Maik] Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 505 GSB, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Messer, Kent D.; Peo, Audrey J.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Alberta; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kecinski@ualberta.ca; messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA14OAR4170087]; National Science Foundation [NSF EPSCoR Rii3 1301765]; USDA-ERS [59-6000-4-0064]; USDA HATCH,United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA-ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA HATCH(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA14OAR4170087), the National Science Foundation (NSF EPSCoR Rii3 1301765), USDA-ERS funded CBEAR (award 59-6000-4-0064) and USDA HATCH.

As one of the most heavily visited U.S. Wilderness areas, the BWCAW represents an ecosystem managed primarily for conservation values that also has a substantial regional economic impact. This combination of high visitation and strong conservation management represents a sustainable symbiotic relationship where visitor expenditures help maintain ecosystem protection. To investigate this symbiotic relationship, the regional economic impacts of the BWCAW were estimated. Multiplier effects were calculated and the sustainability and tradeoffs associated with BWCAW tourism were examined, as was the export nature of BWCAW recreation. Data collection consisted of surveying 2016 summer BWCAW visitors. Visitor regional expenditures were extrapolated to overall visitation data and entered into IMPLAN impact analysis software. Based on 513 completed surveys, and an overall survey response rate of 40%, out-of-region visitors spent over $56 million in the three counties surrounding the BWCAW in 2016, generating $78 million in total economic output and creating 1100 full and part-time jobs. Estimated economic impacts of outdoor recreation and their sustainability can be helpful for informing regional economic development policy for conservation areas world-wide.","[Hjerpe, Evan E.] Conservat Econ Inst, Boise, ID 83701 USA",,"Hjerpe, EE (通讯作者)，Conservat Econ Inst, Boise, ID 83701 USA.",evan@conservationecon.org,,"Hjerpe, Evan/0009-0002-5479-6422",,,,,36,17,21,1,52,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In areas where aquifers are primary sources of fresh water, kiawe control has the potential to be an integral component of water management planning. We develop an analytical dynamic framework for the joint management of kiawe and groundwater, and show that optimal water management depends on expected kiawe damages, while optimal kiawe removal depends on groundwater scarcity and removal cost. Using data from the Kiholo aquifer on the west coast of Hawaii Island, we solve for joint management decisions with corresponding parameters related to kiawe damage and water scarcity. With 1.5% water demand growth, Kiawe should be removed if the removal cost is below $1884/ha. Our numerical results indicate that kiawe damage is nonlinear in the rate of water demand growth. The damage costs can be attributed to three main factors. When demand growth is low, kiawe damage is driven by a higher water extraction cost. For moderate growth, the effect is compounded by anticipated future scarcity. Damage is amplified by a backstop cost effect when the growth rate is high.","[Pongkijvorasin, Sittidaj] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Burnett, Kimberly; Wada, Christopher] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Chulalongkorn University; University of Hawaii System,"Burnett, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kburnett@hawaii.edu,"Burnett, Kimberly/CAF-0517-2022; Wada, Christopher/I-8105-2016","Wada, Christopher/0000-0002-4916-9769","Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant [EPS-0903833]","Chulalongkorn University, Thailand(Chulalongkorn University); National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant","This research was funded in part by a travel grant from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, and National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant No. EPS-0903833.

This study reviews the literature linking source water quality to DWTP expenditures. For each study, we report information on the modeling approach, data structure, definition of treatment costs and water quality, and statistical methods. We then extract elasticities indicating the percentage change in drinking water treatment costs resulting from a 1% change in water quality. Forty-six elasticities are obtained for various water quality parameters, such as turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, sediment loading, and phosphorus loading. An additional 29 elasticities are obtained for land use classification (e.g., forest, agricultural, urban), which often proxy source water quality. Findings indicate relatively large ranges in the estimated elasticities of most parameters and land use classifications. However, average elasticities are smaller and ranges typically narrower for studies that incorporated control variables consistent with economic theory in their models. We discuss the implications of these findings for a DWTP's incentive to engage in source water protection and highlight gaps in the literature.","[Price, James I.; Heberling, Matthew T.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Price, JI (通讯作者)，US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA.",Price.James@epa.gov; Heberling.Matt@epa.gov,"Price, James/ABA-8945-2021","Price, James/0000-0001-9670-5731; Heberling, Matthew/0000-0003-1120-612X",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,64,53,61,6,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While relative decoupling has occurred - that is, resource use has grown less quickly than the economy - absolute decoupling has not, raising the question whether it is possible. This paper proposes a novel explanation for why decoupling has not happened historically, drawing on a recent theory of cost-share induced productivity change and an extension of post-Keynesian pricing theory to natural resources. Cost-share induced productivity change and pricing behavior set up two halves of a dynamic, which we explore from a post-Keynesian perspective. In this dynamic, resource costs as a share of GDP move toward a stable level, at which the growth rate of resource productivity is typically less than the growth rate of GDP. This provides a parsimonious explanation of the prevalence of relative over absolute decoupling. The paper then presents some illustrative applications of the theory.","[Kemp-Benedict, Eric] Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA",,"Kemp-Benedict, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.",eric.kemp-benedict@sei.org,,"Kemp-Benedict, Eric/0000-0001-5794-7172",Stockholm Environment Institute from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [41266],Stockholm Environment Institute from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"The author would like to thank Peter Erickson, Sivan Kartha, Juan Antonio Montecino, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments at different stages of the writing.

Sorghum has proven to be an adaptable and resilient crop despite limited funding for crop development. Recent breeding efforts target hybrid and perennial technologies that may facilitate adaptation to climate change. Advantages of perennial crops over their annual counterparts include improved soil quality and water conservation and reduced inputs and labor requirements. In contrast, hybrid crops are often bred for improved grain yield and earlier maturation to avoid variable conditions. We use discrete choice experiments to model adoption of sorghum as a function of attributes that differ between these technologies and traditional varieties in Mali. Overall, the main perceived advantage of perennial crops is agricultural ecosystem services such as soil improvement, while adoption of hybrid crops is hampered by the inability to reuse seed. Women farmers are less concerned about higher labor requirements associated with perennial crops and the ability to reuse hybrids seeds than male farmers. Farmers prefer traditional sorghum to perennial sorghum and are indifferent between traditional and hybrid sorghum. These findings have important policy implications for understanding tradeoffs that are central to farmer decision making when it comes to breeding technologies for climate adaptation.","[Waldman, Kurt B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Richardson, Robert B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Michigan State University,"Waldman, KB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",kbwaldma@iu.edu; rbr@msu.edu,,"Waldman, Kurt/0000-0002-9643-8378; Richardson, Robert/0000-0001-7113-3896",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076311]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076311] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under Grant OPP1076311.,,45,16,19,6,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Because the ban has been in effect for 40 years, it is unclear how potential legal horn trade should be structured to attain rhino conservation on private lands. We sought to fill this gap by eliciting the preferences of South African private wildlife industry members (who conserve a third of South Africa's rhinoceroses) for international trade in rhino horn. We used a combination of best-worst scaling and dichotomous choice experiments to determine wildlife industry members' preferences for three features of legal trade: market structure; payment/kg horn; and whether landowners should be required to conserve a minimum amount of land per rhino before they may enter the market. Results indicate that respondents preferred payments of at least ZAR 150,000/kg (USD $11,500) and that legal trade not be regulated by government organizations. Respondents did not have clear preferences about whether market participants should be required to meet a minimum land requirement per rhino. Our results provide insights into how potential horn trade policy may be structured to meet the financial needs of private landowners, while securing the conservation of rhinos on private lands.","[Rubino, Elena C.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall,POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Pretoria, South Africa; [Soto, Jose R.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Pretoria; University of Arizona,"Rubino, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall,POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",elenacrubino@gmail.com; efpienaar@ufl.edu; jrs@email.arizona.edu,,"Soto, Jose/0000-0001-8971-1623; Pienaar, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0343-080X",Dallas Safari Club Foundation,Dallas Safari Club Foundation,"We thank everyone who participated in our survey and the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa and the South African Hunters and Game Conservation Association for helping us distribute our survey.

One option to improve the sector's competitiveness is to increase cost efficiency. The goal of this study is to quantify the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency of individual firms by applying the generalized true random effects (GTRE) model introduced by Colombi et al. (Journal of Productivity Analysis 42(2): 123-136, 2014) and Filippini and Greene (Journal of Productivity Analysis 45(2): 187-196, 2016). Applying this newly developed GTRE model to a total cost function, the level of cost efficiency of 65 Swiss hydropower firms is analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2013. A true random effects specification is estimated as a benchmark for the transient level of cost efficiency. The results show the presence of both transient as well as persistent cost inefficiencies. The GTREM predicts the aggregate level of cost inefficiency to amount to 21.8% (8.0% transient, 13.8% persistent) on average between 2000 and 2013. These two components differ in interpretation and implication. From an individual firm's perspective, the two types of cost inefficiencies might require a firm's management to respond with different improvement strategies. The existing level of persistent inefficiency could prevent the hydropower firms from adjusting their production processes to new market environments.

Potassium solubilizing rhizo-bacteria (KSRB) which is a microbial fertilizer can overcome this problem by changing the non available into available soilpotassium. This is a promising strategy for improving of plant absorption of potassium and reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. The objective of this study was to evaluated the ability of fifteen KSRB isolates that isolated from maize rhizosphere to dissolve potassium. Potassium dissolution activity by KSRB isolate was observed using Khandeparkar's selection ratio (modified) by measuring the diameter of the clear zone around the colony compared with the colony diameter on Aleksandrov solid medium (K-feldspar powder as sole potassium source) and pH measurement in Aleksandrov liquid medium. All KSRB isolates were capable of solubilizing K-feldspar powder in solid and liquid medium. There was a high negative correlation between Khandeparkar's selection ratio and pH (r = -0.90**). The highest potassium dissolution activity was shown by RBPK-DHJ3-3150, RBPK-DHJ1-4125, and RBPK-DHJ2-5250 KSRB isolates, which showed Khandeparkar's selection ratio of 5.97, 5.40, and 4.00 while pH 3.34, 3.28, and 3.64 respectively, so these three KSRB isolates were selected as the superior isolates based on the simple scoring and ranking method.","[Herdiyantoro, D.; Setiawati, M.

On the supply side, we operate an auction with small-scale livestock owners who bid for contracts to implement site-specific manure management practices that reduce phosphorus loadings to a major reservoir. On the demand side, we implement a real money, multi-unit public good auction for these contracts with residents who potentially benefit from reduced water quality risks. The experiments allow us to construct supply and demand curves to find an equilibrium price for water quality improvement. The field experiments provide a proof-of-concept for practical implementation of a local market for environmental improvements, even for the challenging context of nonpoint pollution.","[Uchida, Emi; Opaluch, James; Kafle, Achyut; Merrill, Nathaniel H.; Michaud, Clayton; Gill, Carrie Anne] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Gold, Arthur J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Merrill, Nathaniel H.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, 27 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA",University of Rhode Island; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; University of Rhode Island; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Uchida, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.;Uchida, E (通讯作者)，216 Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",euchida@uri.edu,,"Kafle, Achyut/0000-0002-8464-0966","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010-65615-20669, Hatch 1006050]; University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute; University of Connecticut (UConn) AES [CONS00971]; UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute; University of Connecticut (UConn) AES; UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding for this project from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Grant # 2010-65615-20669 and Hatch 1006050), University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute, the University of Connecticut (UConn) AES (#CONS00971) and UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship.

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper approaches the subject more synthetically, presenting generic results on classes of indexes and their properties. In particular, we consider a broad class of indexes containing almost all known indexes and a partition of this class into two subsets, slacks-based indexes and path-based indexes. Slacks-based indexes are expressed in terms of additive or multiplicative slacks for all inputs and outputs, and particular indexes are generated by specifying the form of aggregation over the coordinate-wise slacks. Path-based indexes are expressed in terms of a common contraction/expansion factor, and particular indexes are generated by specifying the form of the path to the frontier of the technology. Owing to an impossibility result in one of our earlier papers, we know that the set of all inefficiency indexes can be partitioned into three subsets: those that satisfy continuity (in quantities and technologies) and violate indication (equal to some specified value if and only if the quantity vector is efficient), those that satisfy indication and violate continuity, and those that satisfy neither. We prove two generic theorems establishing the equivalence of these two partitions: all slacks-based indexes satisfy indication and hence violate continuity, and all path-based indexes satisfy continuity and hence violate indication. We also discuss the few indexes that do not belong to either of these two sets. Our hope is that these results will help guide decisions about specification of the form of efficiency indexes used in empirical analysis.","[Russell, R.

Here, we introduce a new methodology for simulating crop-water production functions using process-based crop growth models, which captures explicitly the interacting effects of farmers' intraseasonal irrigation decision-making, stochastic weather conditions, and physical and socio-economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water. Through a case study application for groundwater irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains, we demonstrate that constraints to irrigation scheduling caused by aquifer depletion, combined with farmers' limited foresight of future weather conditions, have significant impacts on estimated seasonal crop-water production functions. Our results highlight that the failure to account for these factors fully in previous simulation approaches will lead to errors in estimates of the impacts of groundwater depletion on farmers' future resilience to drought and climate change. Our proposed simulation methodology is generalizable to different production systems or crop growth models, and provides a tool for assessing how economic benefits derived from irrigation vary spatially and temporally due to heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and irrigation practices.","[Foster, T.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Brozovic, N.] Univ Nebraska, Robert B Daugherty Water Food Global Inst, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Manchester; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Foster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",timothy.foster@manchester.ac.uk,"Foster, Timothy/JRY-8775-2023","Foster, Timothy/0000-0001-9594-1556",,,,,94,41,46,5,61,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We use a quasi-experimental study design to estimate changes in several income measures, as well as land cover using three waves (2003, 2007, and 2012) of household survey and remote sensing data. Overall, we find no significant impact of CMAs on any of our income measures. However, when disaggregating households by income quartile, we find that access to forest resources in RMNP may have had an income stabilizing effect for poor households. Forest income grew significantly faster among the poorest quartile of treatment relative to control households, partially because poor households recorded very low income from forests at baseline. The effect of CMAs on forest cover is minimal, although we find that conversion of woody savanna and savanna to cropland is more pronounced in villages with CMAs. These findings suggest that in the medium-term, CMAs have failed to deliver conservation or development benefits related to enhancing livelihoods or conserving forests near RMNP. Practitioners should consider different CMA models or other strategies for improving welfare and forest health outcomes in communities neighboring protected areas.","[Jagger, Pamela; Das, Ipsita] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernathy Hall CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Sellers, Samuel] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Kittner, Noah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bush, Glenn K.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Woodwell Climate Research Center,"Jagger, P (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Abernathy Hall CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",pjagger@unc.edu; sellers@uw.edu; nrkittner@berkeley.edu; ipsitad@live.unc.edu; gbush@whrc.org,"Das, Ipsita/T-3524-2019","Kittner, Noah/0000-0002-3449-7823; Jagger, Pamela/0000-0001-7148-432X","Center for International Forestry Research; Collective Action and Property Rights Initiative of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research; National Science Foundation [DDIG 0622392, 1159440]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Social Science Research Council; Carolina Population Center; NIH/NICHD [P2C HD050424]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1159440] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for International Forestry Research; Collective Action and Property Rights Initiative of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Social Science Research Council; Carolina Population Center; NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This project would not have been possible without the cooperation and advice of P.

To guide management intervention for sustainable development after natural disasters, scientists and policymakers need a better understanding of the linkages between livelihood changes after natural disasters and recovery outcomes. Despite the growing body of disaster research, systematic evaluation of the relationship between post-disaster changes in rural livelihoods and recovery outcomes is rare, largely due to the lack of relevant data. By taking advantage of the long-term data collection and research conducted in China's Wolong Nature Reserve (Wolong), we empirically evaluated livelihood changes after the catastrophic 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and how those changes are linked to the recovery of human well-being. Our results show that households' livelihood portfolios in Wolong conspicuously changed after the earthquake and that human well-being had been recovering. However, we found most of these livelihood changes negatively affected, instead of facilitated, human well-being recovery. The enriched understanding of the linkages between post-disaster livelihood changes and recovery outcomes has important management implications for achieving Sustainable Development Goals amid natural disasters in Wolong and beyond.","[Yang, Hongbo; Dietz, Thomas; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yang, Wu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jindong] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Zhejiang University; China West Normal University,"Liu, JG (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA.",yanghon8@msu.edu; tdietz@msu.edu; wyang@zju.edu.cn; zhangjd224@163.com; liuji@msu.edu,"Liu, Jianguo/G-5211-2015; Yang, Wu/JPK-4460-2023; Yang, Hongbo/AAL-4818-2021","Liu, Jianguo/0000-0001-6344-0087; Yang, Wu/0000-0002-1682-3349; Yang, Hongbo/0000-0001-5935-6595; Dietz, Thomas/0000-0001-9399-0784",U.S. National Science Foundation [130313]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0503404]; Michigan State University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571517],"U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Michigan State University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank Sue Nichols and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an early draft of this paper.

Heavy reliance on fuelwood is associated with numerous negative externalities. Due to decades of rapid economic growth in China, we hypothesize that the increase in rural household income would reduce reliance on fuelwood. Using data from a survey of 481 households conducted in 2014, we examined the effects of two payments for ecosystem services programs, the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP) and the Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP), on energy use, along with other factors. We found that the CCFP did not significantly affect fuel choice nor the quantity of fuelwood used, but households with more forestland in EWFP were less likely to adopt modern fuels and likely to use more fuelwood. Household per capita annual income was the main factor promoting adoption of modem fuels, while household size was the most important factor determining the quantity of fuelwood used per capita. Overall, the gradually increasing adoption of modern fuels has thus far not resulted in any significant abandonment of fuelwood. Fuelwood remains the dominant fuel across all income groups, suggesting that households in the study area are in the early stages of the energy transition.","[Song, Conghe; Bilsborrow, Richard; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Xiaodong] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard; Jagger, Pamela] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bilsborrow, Richard] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog & Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Huang, Qingfeng] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Anhui Agricultural University,"Song, CH (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",csong@email.unc.edu,"chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; Zhang, Qi/I-9741-2016; Song, Conghe/E-3087-2016","Zhang, Qi/0000-0002-4242-7614; bilsborrow, richard/0000-0002-0053-7356; Song, Conghe/0000-0002-4099-4906",National Science Foundation [DEB-1313756]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1313756] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-1313756) to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

We integrated remotely-sensed forest cover images, georeferenced landscape information, field-level forest inventories and face-to-face landowner surveys to quantify avoided deforestation and degradation within the context of Ecuador's Socio Bosque Program (PSB). We found the PSB prevented 9% of enrolled forest area in Ecuador's Amazon Basin from being deforested over the 2008-2014 period. This value is higher than previous assessments conducted in other Latin American nations. Inventory data suggest that forests within PSB-enrolled areas exhibited less evidence of degradation although statistical differences were only marginally significant On average, PSB-enrolled forests had between one and two more tree species per hectare than non-enrolled forests. These additional tree species'were twice as likely to be of commercial timber value and at greater threat of extinction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The direct-mail marketing experiment collected over $16,000 through four provision point, money-back guarantee mechanisms: a voluntary contribution mechanism with a proportional rebate; a pivotal mechanism based on the Clarke tax; and two novel uniform price mechanisms, each presented in discrete choice and open-ended response formats. We find thatcitizens do respond strategically: consistently lower offers in the open-ended format suggest a high incidence of cheap riding, but also a significant effect of higher suggested offer thresholds.

However, these processes are acknowledged to require decades to achieve their intended changes, a timeframe that is too long to adequately address many of the environmental and social issues many industrialized and industrializing nations are facing. An approach that involves incumbents and does not consider targets that look beyond reasonably foreseeable technology is likely to advance a model where incumbents evolve rather than being replaced or displaced. On the other hand, approaches that focus on creating new entrants could nurture niche development or deployment of disruptive technologies, but those technologies may only be marginally better than the technologies they replace. Either approach may take a long time to achieve their goals. Sustainable development requires both radical disruptive technological and institutional changes, the latter including stringent regulation, the integration of disparate goals, and changes in incentives to enable new voices to contribute to new systems and solutions. This paper outlines options for a strong governmental role in setting future sustainability goals and the pathways for achieving them.","[Ashford, Nicholas A.] MIT, Technol & Law Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hall, Ralph P.] Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Blacksburg, VA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Ashford, NA (通讯作者)，MIT, Technol & Law Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",nashford@mit.edu,"Hall, Ralph P/AAA-6491-2021; Hall, Ralph/Z-1692-2019","Hall, Ralph P/0000-0003-4788-0976; Hall, Ralph/0000-0003-4788-0976",,,,,130,14,16,1,42,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The core of the model is a standard macroeconomic DSGE framework that includes nominal and real frictions. The model includes oil as an input in multiple domestic sectors (consumption, intermediate goods, and transportation services). We include a domestic oil production sector for the United States to reflect the recent development in shale oil technology. The model also captures international trade in goods and oil. The model parameters are set through a combination of calibration and Bayesian estimation using quarterly data for 1991 through 2015. Baseline estimation of the model finds the elasticity of U.S. real GDP with respect to an oil price shock of 0.015, which is among the less elastic estimates in the literature. Using the model to conduct counterfactual analysis, we find that decreasing steady state U.S. oil consumption substantially reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices. Increasing U.S. domestic oil production only modestly reduces the response of real GDP to oil prices.","[Balke, Nathan S.] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Balke, Nathan S.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, POB 655906, Dallas, TX 75265 USA; [Brown, Stephen P.

In this study, we examine the fuel-price responsiveness across gas plant technologies and across the market structures in which the plants operate. We find that there are significant differences in the generation and efficiency responses of gas plants to fuel prices across generation technologies and market structures. Specifically, our results indicate that, regardless of market structure, generation from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants is responsive to both coal and gas prices, but that generation from simple cycle (NGSC) plants only respond to gas prices. On the other hand, with respect to efficiency, we generally find that only NGCC plants operating in deregulated regions show statistically significant efficiency improvements in response to coal price increases and that, generally, neither NGCC or NGSC plants, regardless of market structure, respond in any significant way to gas prices. Finally, using these parameter estimates, we calculate emissions savings from efficiency improvements and fuel-switching possibilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Guidance on siting of these renewable energy facilities may help identify potential wildlife-facility conflicts with species of regulatory or economic concern. However, existing spatial guidance usually does not consider all wildlife that might use a potential facility location or corridors for its servicing infrastructure. We illustrate an approach toward assessing potential wildlife-facility conflicts using readily available vertebrate habitat models. The U.S. Geological Survey's Gap Analysis Program (GAP) has developed spatial models of potential habitat for vertebrate species across the entire nation. To illustrate their applicability, we used GAP models to estimate richness of all native, terrestrial vertebrates within Arizona and for those vertebrates grouped by class or by sensitivity to the type of facility infrastructure. We examined the spatial overlap of high species richness of each group with agency-developed guidance used to inform facility-siting decisions and found that GAP-based richness mappings augmented existing guidance. As the GAP vertebrate habitat models are publicly available for the entire USA, use of these data can provide a coarse view of potential wildlife-facility conflicts and inform facility planning early in the process.","[Thomas, Kathryn A.; Jarchow, Christopher J.; Jamwal, Pankaj; Borens, Amanda] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, N Pk St,Suite 221, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Arundel, Terence R.; Drost, Charles A.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, 2255N Gemini Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Jamwal, Pankaj] Pima Cty, Informat Technol Dept, 33 N Stone Ave, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Thomas, KA (通讯作者)，US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, N Pk St,Suite 221, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",Kathryn_a_thomas@usgs.gov,,"Borens, Amanda/0000-0002-5695-3463","US Geological Survey Core Science Analytics, Synthesis & Library's National Gap Analysis Program; US Geological Survey Ecosystems Program","US Geological Survey Core Science Analytics, Synthesis & Library's National Gap Analysis Program; US Geological Survey Ecosystems Program(United States Geological Survey)","We thank Dr. Joyce Francis of the Arizona Game and Fish Department for providing the list of terrestrial vertebrate species in Arizona and advising the project on use of the Species and Habitat Conservation Guide.

This understanding, combined with a focus on energy services (e.g. lighting, heating, telecommunications, mobility, etc.) helps to prioritize actions to achieve the goal of energy security. This paper conceptualizes energy security as low vulnerability of vital energy systems and sustained provision of modern energy services. Taking Tajikistan as a case, this paper highlights key vulnerabilities including neglect of environmental conditions, insufficient energy production capacity, unreliable and expensive energy imports, dwindling power infrastructure causing technical and economic losses, inadequate transparency in the power sector, lack of regional cooperation in energy and water resources sharing, and inadequate financial resources to address these challenges. Three major proposals presented by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Government of Tajikistan to achieve energy security in Tajikistan are evaluated. Specifically, they lack a focus on energy services and therefore overlook people's socio-cultural context and appropriate energy needs. This paper highlights energy services as critical to people's wellbeing and socioeconomic development.","[Laldjebaev, Murodbek] Univ Cent Asia, Sch Arts & Sci, 155 Qimatsho Imatzho St, Khorog 736000, Gbao, Tajikistan; [Laldjebaev, Murodbek] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, 155 Qimatsho Imatzho St, Khorog 736000, Tajikistan; [Morreale, Stephen J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 108 Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sussex Energy Grp, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Kassam, Karim-Aly S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 122 Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Central Asia; University of Central Asia; Cornell University; University of Sussex; Cornell University,"Laldjebaev, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Asia, Sch Arts & Sci, 155 Qimatsho Imatzho St, Khorog 736000, Gbao, Tajikistan.;Laldjebaev, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, 155 Qimatsho Imatzho St, Khorog 736000, Tajikistan.",murodbek.laljebaev@ucentralasia.org; sjm1@cornell.edu; B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk; ksk28@cornell.edu,"Laldjebaev, Murodbek/H-4851-2015; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Laldjebaev, Murodbek/0000-0002-4106-7039; Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",,,,,63,29,32,2,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,39,50,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.058,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000424962800005,0

Simulations are developed to estimate a range in supply potential and costs across a broad range of sensitivity scenarios, including (1) different biomass availability rates based on observed roundwood removals, (2) renewable energy targets set nationally or at a state-level, (3) with and without biomass sourcing restrictions within a state, (4) with and without access to public lands, and (5) policy restrictions on eligible facility types. Under the least restrictive policy scenario (a hypothetical national mandate), total supply is 8.8 million dry tons (MDT) at $20/DT and increases to 32.5 MDT at $80/DT. Results fall within the range of previous logging residue supply studies in the U.S., including the last two Billion Ton reports. Results from this paper offer important policy insight into the potential cost efficiency of a flexible policy design. Sensitivity scenarios show potential supply cost increases that could result from policies imposing regional restrictions, limiting access to public lands, and restricting eligible facilities. Restricting biomass supply sources within state boundaries reduces total supply up to 10% relative to an unrestricted national policy.","[Baker, Justin S.; Crouch, Adam; Cai, Yongxia; Jones, Jason; Latane, Annah] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Latta, Greg] Univ Idaho, Nat Resources & Soc, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Ohrel, Sara] US EPA, Washington, DC 20004 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Idaho; University of Idaho; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Baker, JS (通讯作者)，RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA.",justinbaker@rti.org,,"Cai, Yongxia/0000-0002-1954-269X; Latane, Annah/0000-0002-6786-7747; Baker, Justin/0000-0002-9914-8421; Jones, Jason/0000-0002-0194-9512",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [EP-BPA-12-H-0023],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This paper was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Contract EP-BPA-12-H-0023, Call Order # EP-B15H-0143 and Call Order # EP-B16H-00029).

Lacking economically viable storage options, renewable energy integration is possible thanks to the presence of modem mid-merit fossil-based technologies, which act as back-up capacity. This paper discusses the role of modem fossil-based power generation technologies in supporting renewable energy investments. We study the deployment of these two technologies conditional on all other drivers in 26 OECD countries between 1990 and 2013. We show that moving from the first to the third quartile of the distribution of modem fossil technologies is associated with an increase in yearly renewable energy investment of between 6 and 14 kW per thousand people, on average and ceteris paribus. This is a sizeable effect, considering that average yearly renewable capacity addition in our sample are around 12 kW per thousand people. These findings are robust to different econometric specifications, various definitions of modern fossil technologies and are stronger for wind, which is more intermittent and for which the mismatch between supply and demand is more marked. Our analysis points to the substantial indirect costs of renewable energy integration and highlights the complementarity of investments in different generation technologies for a successful decarbonization process.","[Verdolini, Elena] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Milan, Italy; [Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, OFCE Sci Po, Nice, France; [Vona, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Nice, France; [Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，Fdn CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",elena.verdolini@feem.it,"Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020","Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [308481]; Horizon Research and Innovation Programme [730403]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [320278],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Horizon Research and Innovation Programme; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"Elena Verdolini gratefully acknowledges funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No 308481 (ENTRACTE) and from the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No 730403 (INNOPATHS).

Focusing on the role and function of cities in processes of innovation, production, distribution and consumption as both individual sites and networks of sites of production, the papers examine classic questions in economic geography about concentration, diffusion, and flows of labour and capital and the policy regimes that govern that movement. They also contribute empirically and theoretically to opening up broader conversations from a global perspective regarding how cities serve as nodes in global networks both anchoring and ultimately locating global and regional flows of capital and labour. Finally, they identify what is at stake in debates over cities and regional development.","[Clark, Jennifer] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Harrison, John] Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Miguelez, Ernest] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Bordeaux, France; [Miguelez, Ernest] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Barcelona, Spain",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Loughborough University; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Barcelona,"Clark, J (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jennifer.clark@gatech.edu; j.harrison4@lboro.ac.uk; ernest.miguelez@u-bordeaux.fr,"Harrison, John/D-1485-2010; Miguelez, Ernest/A-1254-2017","Miguelez, Ernest/0000-0002-8224-6842; Clark, Jennifer/0000-0001-7908-032X; Harrison, John/0000-0002-6434-5142",Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering [1441208] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),,,33,21,21,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper studies the role of commuter rail stations in population deconcentration, modelled through the relationship between in-migration and out-commuting from census tracts. It finds that increased migration in station areas suppresses population deconcentration, seemingly enabling node-based development. However, this effect does not hold across all stations. Preliminary evidence suggests that commercial development in station areas facilitates migrants working locally, decreasing deconcentration - and possibly helping regions work toward sustainability goals.","[Ganning, Joanna] Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Dept Urban Studies, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Ganning, J (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Maxine Goodman Levin Coll Urban Affairs, Dept Urban Studies, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",j.ganning@csuohio.edu,"Ganning, Joanna/JHT-1366-2023",,"National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University [778]; Wasatch Front Regional Council; Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center; University of Utah","National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University; Wasatch Front Regional Council; Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center; University of Utah","This research was funded by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities (NITC), a programme of the Transportation Research and Education Center (TREC) at Portland State University [grant number 778], with additional support from the Wasatch Front Regional Council, the Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center and multiple academic departments within the University of Utah.",,29,1,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A novel experimental design allows us to elicit subjects' ex ante knowledge levels about a public good's attributes, exogenously vary how much new objective information about these attributes we provide to subjects, elicit subjects' valuation for the good, and elicit posterior knowledge states about the same attributes. We find evidence of incomplete learning and fatigue: as subjects are told more information, their marginal learning rates decrease. Consistent with previous work, ex ante knowledge does affect stated willingness to pay. However, we find no significant marginal impact of knowledge on the mean nor the variance of willingness to pay for changes in the environmental good conditional on ex ante knowledge.

If consumption-based emissions measures that account for countries' net emissions embodied in cross-border trade are used, the evidence for decoupling in the richer economies gets weaker. Countries with underlying policy frameworks more supportive of renewable energy and climate change mitigation efforts tend to show greater decoupling between trend emissions and trend GDP, and for both production and consumption-based emissions.

Common estimation approaches vary widely but consider tables and flows independently. By using commonly used economic assumptions and available economic information, this paper presents a method that integrates the estimation of regional input-output tables and trade flows across regions.

The results provide evidence of a long run equilibrium relationship between access to electricity and labour productivity for developing countries in presence of the control variables. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) heterogeneous panel non-causality test underscores a bidirectional causal relationship between these two key variables in the short-run. Based on these results, we recommend that policymakers ensure access to electricity for mass people in developing countries to increase productivity and thus to improve the living standards of their citizens.

Literature estimates of the economic impacts of oil price shocks, summarized by the oil price elasticity of GDP, span a very wide range due to both fundamental economic and methodological factors. This paper presents a quantitative meta-analysis of the oil price elasticity of GDP for net oil importing countries, with a focus on the United States (US). The full range of estimates of the oil price elasticity of GDP for the US in the data is - 0.124 to + 0.017, accounting for different methodologies, data and other factors. We employ a meta-regression model that controls for key determinant factors to estimate the mean and variance of the GDP elasticity across studies. We use a robust estimation technique to deal with heterogeneity of the data and well-known econometric issues that confront mew-analysis. The resulting regression model is used to simulate the oil price elasticity of GDP for the US, with a mean of - 0.020% and 68% confidence interval of - 0.035 to - 0.006, four quarters after a shock.","[Oladosu, Gbadebo A.; Leiby, Paul N.; Bowman, David C.; Uria-Martinez, Rocio; Johnson, Megan M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Oladosu, GA (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",oladosuga@ornl.gov; leibypn@ornl.gov; bowmandc@ornl.gov; uriamartiner@ornl.gov; johnsonmm@ornl.gov,,"Uria-Martinez, Rocio/0000-0001-9689-9951",US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office [DE-AC05-00OR22725],US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This material is based upon work supported by the US Department of Energy under the Strategic Petroleum Reserves Office, and performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under contract number DE-AC05-00OR22725.

This paper identifies administrative factors and market barriers as the main causes of renewable curtailment. In 2017, the Northwest Power Grid (NWPG) successfully implemented a variety of approaches to reduce wind and solar curtailment. In this paper, we analyze the change in power generation, expansion of renewable energy delivery, and electricity-replacement projects across provinces that occurred in 2017. While acknowledging the practical results of the NWPG's efforts, we identify challenges that the northwest still faces in integrating renewable energy. We argue that trans-regional administrative barriers are preventing the effective utilization of renewable energy nationwide. To address those barriers, we explore market-based mechanisms for promoting the integration of large-scale renewable energy. In addition to long-term contracts for renewable energy across provinces, both spot-market and the ancillary service market would facilitate the uptake of renewable energy.

The individual effects are allowed to be correlated with the regressors, and the comparison is carried out in terms of an exponent coefficient, , which measures the degree of pervasiveness of the FE in the panel. The use of allows us to distinguish between poolability of small N dimensional panels with large T from large N dimensional panels with small T. It is shown that the pooled estimator remains consistent so long as delta<1, and is asymptotically normally distributed if delta <1/2, for a fixed T and as N. It is further shown that when delta<1/2, the pooled estimator is more efficient than the FE estimator. We also propose a Hausman type diagnostic test of delta<1/2 as a simple test of poolability, and propose a pretest estimator that could be used in practice. Monte Carlo evidence supports the main theoretical findings and gives some indications of gains to be made from pooling when delta <1/2.","[Pesaran, M.

The unidentified parameter - the variance of the disturbance term in the selection equation - is handled in different ways in these algorithms to achieve identification for other parameters.

We expect that fulfilling this pledge will likely require a reduced reliance on fossil-based energy and additional investments in low-carbon energy sources. To fully assess these impacts, we develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Turkish economy that combines macroeconomic representation of non-electric sectors with a detailed power sector representation. We analyze several scenarios to assess the impact of an emission trading scheme: one including the planned nuclear development and a renewable subsidy scheme (BAU), and another with no nuclear technology allowed (NoN). Our assessment shows that in 2030, without policy, primary energy will be mainly oil, natural gas and coal. Under an emission trading scheme, however, coal-fired power generation vanishes by 2030 in both BAU and NoN due to the high cost of carbon. With nuclear (BAU), GHG emissions are 3.1% lower than NoN due to the resulting energy mix, allowing for a lower carbon price ($50/tCO2 in BAU compared to $70/tCO2 in NoN). Our results suggest that fulfillment of Turkey's pledge may be possible at a modest economic cost of about 0.8-1% by 2030.","[Kat, Bora; Paltsev, Sergey; Yuan, Mei] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kat, Bora] Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey TUBITAK, Ankara, Turkey; [Kat, Bora] Middle East Tech Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Earth Syst Sci, Ankara, Turkey",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK); Middle East Technical University,"Kat, B (通讯作者)，Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey TUBITAK, Ankara, Turkey.",bora.kat@tubitak.gov.tr,"Kat, Bora/R-1990-2018; yuan, meiyi/AAR-5159-2020","Kat, Bora/0000-0002-6863-6940; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",Turkish Fulbright Commission [FY-2016-TR-SS-09],Turkish Fulbright Commission,"The authors thank Jamie Bartholomay for her help with the paper.

One such avoided cost that has received little attention is the market price response, or how distributed PV generation reduces utilities' procurement costs and, consequently, consumers' costs through reduced wholesale electricity prices in the short-term. We quantify the reduction in day-ahead wholesale electricity prices to distributed PV generation in California (CA) from 2013 through 2015. Using a database of all distributed PV systems in the three CA investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation using three methods that we validate with metered generation from 205 PV systems. Via multiple linear regression, we then estimate electricity price reductions due to distributed PV generation. Across the three methods used to estimate PV generation, distributed PV generation reduced hourly median (mean) wholesale electricity prices by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh ($2.9-3.2/MWh) ($(2015)), or by 7-8% (8-9%). Lower wholesale prices reduced utilities' energy procurement costs in the day-ahead market by up to $650-730 million ($(2015)) from 2013 through 2015. These avoided costs are similar to other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies.","[Craig, Michael T.; Hodge, Bri-Mathias] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy,MS ESIF200, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Jaramillo, Paulina; Williams, Nathaniel J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave,129 Baker Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Severnini, Edson] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Craig, MT (通讯作者)，Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy,MS ESIF200, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",Michael.Craig@nrel.gov,"Williams, Nathan/AAR-2456-2020; Jaramillo, Paulina/E-4671-2013; Hodge, Bri-Mathias S./H-4265-2019","Williams, Nathan/0000-0002-5676-2288; Jaramillo, Paulina/0000-0002-4214-1106; Craig, Michael/0000-0002-3031-5041",Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering via the Claire and John Bertucci Fellowship; ARCS Foundation; National Science Foundation [EFRI-1441131]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [A14OAR4310249]; National Renewable Energy Laboratory under the U.S. Department of Energy Prime Contract [DE-AC36-08GO28308],Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering via the Claire and John Bertucci Fellowship; ARCS Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Renewable Energy Laboratory under the U.S. Department of Energy Prime Contract,This research was supported by the Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering via the Claire and John Bertucci Fellowship; the ARCS Foundation; the National Science Foundation via Grant Number EFRI-1441131; and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via Award Number A14OAR4310249.

The exact dates (i.e., timing) of the stepdown events were not known, yet recent analyses find evidence of an announcement effect wherein consumer adoption is pulled-forward across these stepdown events. We analyze unique data from our recent household-level survey on the decision-making process for 194 of these very consumers within a narrow window of eight CSI rebate stepdown events, comparing the decision-making processes of pulled-forward consumers to their counterparts that adopt just after a rebate stepdown. We find evidence that a subset of pre-stepdown adopters engage in more savvy decision-making behaviors from their post-stepdown counterparts, including strategic adoption timing. Given these behavioral differences, we conclude that future analyses should carefully consider aspects of individual decision-making processes as potential confounders and control for them if possible. Experience is identified as a potential pathway through which this non-negligible subset of adopters may gain the ability to execute savvy decision-making behaviors; future research should assess the degree to which policy implementation can explicitly leverage this pathway.","[Reeves, D.

The control group dramatically overestimates how much winning would help them grow the size of their firm.

These forecasts are an important input to integrated resource planning (IRP) processes involving utilities, regulators, and other stake-holders. Despite their importance, however, there has been little analysis of long term utility load forecasting accuracy. We conduct a retrospective analysis of long term load forecasts on twelve Western U. S. electric utilities in the mid-2000s to find that most overestimated both energy consumption and peak demand growth. A key reason for this was the use of assumptions that led to an overestimation of economic growth. We find that the complexity of forecast methods and the accuracy of these forecasts are mildly correlated. In addition, sensitivity and risk analysis of load growth and its implications for capacity expansion were not well integrated with subsequent implementation. We review changes in the utilities load forecasting methods over the subsequent decade, and discuss the policy implications of long term load forecast inaccuracy and its underlying causes.","[Carvallo, Juan Pablo; Larsen, Peter H.; Sanstad, Alan H.; Goldman, Charles A.] Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, MS, 1 Cyclotron Rd,90R4000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Carvallo, JP (通讯作者)，Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, MS, 1 Cyclotron Rd,90R4000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jpcarvallo@lbl.gov,"Larsen, Peter H./AAD-2874-2019; Carvallo, Juan Pablo/ABH-3869-2020","Goldman, Charles/0000-0003-3117-4014",National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231],National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),The work described in this article was funded by the National Electricity Delivery Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity (OE) Delivery and Energy Reliability under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.,,38,40,45,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,410,422,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.060,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000439671200038,0

Allowing citizens and companies to invest in renewable energy and thereby become independent power producers has advanced the acceptance of renewable energy among the population, accelerating the move toward a more decentralized and sustainable power supply. We investigate how a REC could be designed to increase renewable energy deployment at the Port of Rotterdam. Based on a progressive case study conducted among a wide array of stakeholders at the Port and across Europe, we have found 14 specific characteristics a REC should embody to facilitate the energy transition at the Port. Based on these results, we present an action plan with concrete recommendations on how a successful cooperative could be launched at the Port.

WBP is among the most promising additions to energy generation portfolios for reducing import dependency while at the same time providing economic opportunity to stimulate regional economies, especially in rural regions where economic development options are often limited. We use an input-output framework to assess WBP under three different pathways, fast pyrolysis, ethanol and coal biomass to liquids. We find that the proposed WBP will increase regional output by 0.5-1.3% of gross regional product; it will increase income by $17.32 to $51.31 million dollars each year, and regional employment by 218.1-1127.8 jobs, depending on the chosen pathway. Of these impacts, the direct portions are 63-77% of the total impact, depending on the chosen pathway. The economic analysis and the results from the accompanying environmental assessment show that only the ethanol pathway has both economic and environmental benefits. We conclude that because long-run economic development strategies in rural regions are limited and negative impacts do not alter dramatically the regional environmental profile, regional policymakers should include WBP among their development portfolio options.","[Jackson, Randall W.] West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Ferreira Neto, Amir B.] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Erfanian, Elham] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Jackson, RW (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, 886 Chestnut Ridge Rd,POB 6825, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",randall.jackson@mail.wvu.edu; amneto@mix.wvu.edu; Elhamerfanian@mix.wvu.edu,"Jackson, Randall/G-9589-2014","Jackson, Randall/0000-0002-4765-3071","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2012-67009-19660]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under award number 2012-67009-19660.",,64,31,31,3,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,66,77,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.001,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000428099800007,0

Our estimator captures the average causal response to discrete policy interventions in a macrodynamic setting, without the need for assumptions about the process generating macroeconomic outcomes. The proposed estimation strategy, based on propensity score weighting, easily accommodates asymmetric and nonlinear responses. Using this estimator, we show that monetary tightening has clear effects on the yield curve and on economic activity. Monetary accommodation, however, appears to generate less pronounced responses from both. Estimates for recent financial crisis years display a similarly dampened response to monetary accommodation.","[Angrist, Joshua D.] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr Bldg E52,Room 436, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Angrist, Joshua D.] NBER, Dept Econ, E52-436 MIT 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jorda, Oscar] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Jorda, Oscar] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA; [Kuersteiner, Guido M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Davis; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr Bldg E52,Room 436, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Angrist, JD (通讯作者)，NBER, Dept Econ, E52-436 MIT 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",angrist@mit.edu; oscar.jorda@sf.frb.org; kuersteiner@econ.umd.edu,"Angrist, Josh/ADL-8782-2022",,,,,,55,55,63,3,34,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

There is a growing body of literature evaluating the extent of this corresponding price reduction, termed 'incentive pass-through', typically finding nearly complete path-through for host-owned systems. However, few studies hitherto had the data to reliably estimate path-through for third-party owned systems, which comprise most of new installations over this period. This study evaluates incentive pass-through for third-party owned systems in California between 2010 and 2014. The estimation results show path-through rate is around 62%, suggesting that unlike host-owned systems, a portion of the incentive reduced the contract price of the system and the rest of the incentive was retained by the installer. This study has important implications for future subsidy program design in the presence of different ownership types in the market.","[Li, Yumin] Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Li, Yumin] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Shanghai University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Li, YM (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",yuminli@shu.edu.cn,"lu, qian/IUN-7445-2023",,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The author would like to thank Changgui Dong, Zhuoxin Li, Shiyuan Li, Ben Sigrin, Daniel Steinberg, Carolyn Pino, Ruxiao Wang and Jarret Zuboy for their review and input on the study.

Because many pollutants are regulated separately, designing inter-pollutant markets requires considering pre-existing regulatory constraints. We examine the optimal choices of inter-and intra-pollutant trade ratios when (i) some firms generate multiple pollutants affecting different media and (ii) permit caps are sub-optimal, having been exogenously specified by prior regulations. While the first-best outcome is unobtainable in this setting, we find inter-pollutant trading enhances efficiency by offering an additional policy instrument: the inter-pollutant trade ratio. Moreover, adjustments to intra-pollutant trade ratios reflecting the joint production of dis-similar pollutants can enhance efficiency. We also find realistic cases where inter-pollutant trading may universally improve environmental quality, easing concerns that trading across environmental media may harm one medium. An example of nitrogen trading in Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River Basin illustrates our results.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is a strong interconnection between Spain's and Portugal's transmission systems, resulting in common prices in both countries. However, Portuguese and Spanish producers receive the incentives for producing wind-based electricity that are specified in their own national policies, resulting in different costs to rate-payers. In this paper, we estimate the costs to Portuguese rate-payers associated with the current market design and policy incentives. To do so, we regress hourly spot electricity market prices as a function of hourly wind generation, and estimate the resulting feed-in-tariff costs distributional effects over the various rate-payer categories. Total costs for rate payer are at the minimum level if joint wind generation in Portugal and Spain increases by 5.5% from what it is today. If wind generation increases much further, then the costs increase due to the FiT overcost increase. If wind generation decreases from current levels, then costs also increase due to the merit-order effect. Furthermore, we find that rate-payer categories will endure different portions of the costs, with an increase in wind generation penalizing predominantly <= 20.7 kVA rate-payers.","[Prata, Ricardo; Carvalho, Pedro M.

We use a profile likelihood approach to estimate the index and dispersion parameters. Our method is capable of fitting a flexible nonlinear Tweedie model and capturing complex interactions among predictors. A simulation study confirms the excellent prediction performance of our method. As an application, we apply our method to an auto-insurance claim data and show that the new method is superior to the existing methods in the sense that it generates more accurate premium predictions, thus helping solve the adverse selection issue.

Our key contributions are (i) an intuitive description of the conditions under which groundwater extraction can be non-monotonic, (ii) a numerical demonstration that extraction is non-monotonic in an important region overlying the Ogallala Aquifer, and (iii) the predicted gains from management are substantially larger after accounting for climate and technical change. Intuitively, optimal extraction is increasing in early periods when the marginal benefits of extraction are increasing sufficiently fast due to climate and technical change compared to the increase in the marginal cost of extraction. In contrast, most previous studies include the stock of groundwater as the only state variable and recommend a monotonically decreasing extraction path. We conduct numerical simulations for a region in Kansas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer and find that optimal groundwater extraction peaks 23 years in the future and the gains from management are large (29.5%). Consistent with previous literature, the predicted gains from management are relatively small (6.1%) when ignoring climate and technical change. The realized gains from management are not substantially impacted by incorrect assumptions of climate and technical change when formulating the optimal plan. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A learning curve analysis is conducted on an original dataset of 312 Chinese wind farms under the Clean Development Mechanism. A key strength of the dataset is that it includes data on actual, wind-farm level power generation. The analysis, based on third-party verified data, reveals that the experience and knowledge accumulation did not result in improvements in generation performance, turbine size, or unit turbine costs of Chinese wind farms. Rather, generation performance was driven by capital investments (i.e., larger and more expensive wind farms performed better). Turbine cost reductions were achieved by intense price competition which hampered investments in technology improvement and quality assurance. The Chinese wind power case demonstrates how market expansion, in the absence of carefully designed innovation policies that complement deployment policies, does not necessarily lead to technological learning. Fostering the technological capability of local industry can take a long time. When scale-up happens quickly, it is crucial to develop and refine local technological capability.","[Hayashi, Daisuke] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Int Relat, Kyoto, Japan; [Hayashi, Daisuke] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huenteler, Joern] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lewis, Joanna, I] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Sci Technol & Int Affairs Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Ritsumeikan University; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Georgetown University,"Hayashi, D (通讯作者)，56-1 Toji In Kitamachi,Kita Ku, Kyoto 6008577, Japan.",dhayashi@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,"Lewis, Joanna I./0000-0002-5362-1308","JSPS KAKENHI [15K16163]; National Science Foundation [1262452]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K16163] Funding Source: KAKEN; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1262452] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant number 15K16163] and the National Science Foundation [Award number 1262452].

This paper contributes to this literature through an analysis of multiple projected sources of biomass demand growth in different regions of the world using a detailed intertemporal optimization model of the global forest sector. Given the range of current policies incentivizing bioenergy expansion globally, evaluating the combined global implications of regional bioenergy expansion efforts is critical for understanding the extent to which renewable energy supplied from forest biomass can contribute to various policy goals (including GHG emissions mitigation). Unlike previous studies that have been more regionally focused, this study provides a global perspective, illustrating how large potential demand increases for forest biomass in one or multiple regions can alter future forest management trends, markets, and forest carbon sequestration in key timber supply regions. Results show that potential near term (2015-2030) biomass demand growth in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere can drive forest resource investment at the intensive and extensive margins, resulting in a net increase in forest carbon stocks for most regions of the world. When the reallocation of biomass away from traditional pulp and sawtimber markets is accounted for, net forest carbon sequestration increases (that stored on the land and in wood products) by 9.4 billion tons CO2 over the near term and 15.4 billion tons CO2 by 2095. Even if most of the increased forest biomass demand arises from one region (e.g., Europe) due to a particularly strong promotion of forest bioenergy expansion, changes in forest management globally in anticipation of this demand increase could result in carbon beneficial outcomes that can be shared by most regions.

Today, offshore wind is the prevailing marine renewable technology but there is growing progress towards developing others, such as tidal stream energy (TSE) turbines which capture kinetic energy from tidal currents. Using historical operations data from 18 wind farms and simulated generation data for two TSE sites in the UK, we estimate that TSE projects offer about $10/MW h more in net social benefits than offshore wind projects. This estimate includes the value of energy generated, value of reduced marginal CO2 emissions, cost of visual changes to the landscape, and cost of energy generation forecast errors. However, relative to offshore wind, the increased cost of TSE projects far outweighs the increased social benefits. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of TSE projects is expected to be about $74/MW h to $330/MW h higher than offshore wind projects through 2050. Only with optimistic LCOE projections, small TSE projects (20 MW) may be competitive (when including increased net social benefits) with small offshore wind projects by 2020.","[Lamy, Julian V.; Azevedo, Ines L.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Lamy, JV (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",jlamy@andrew.cmu.edu; iazevedo@cmu.edu,"Azevedo, Inês/HNQ-6690-2023; Azevedo, José Manuel Neto/C-1504-2010","Azevedo, José Manuel Neto/0000-0003-2573-1371","Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) [SES-0949710, SES-1463492]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was funded by the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) through a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation and Carnegie Mellon University (SES-0949710 and SES-1463492).

Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model - which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction - and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980-2012, contributing almost 25% of the decline. Government-funded and private R&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R&D and scale economies, and to a lecser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.","[Kavlak, Goksin; McNerney, James; Trancik, Jessika E.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Trancik, Jessika E.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); The Santa Fe Institute,"Trancik, JE (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",trancik@mit.edu,"Kavlak, Goksin/H-8224-2014","Kavlak, Goksin/0000-0001-9380-6449; /0000-0001-8338-7244",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-EE0006131],U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank Geoffrey Kinsey, Richard Swanson, Michael Woodhouse, Paula Mints, Adam Cohen, Marie Mapes, Dave Rench-McCauley, Gregory Nemet, Marius Peters, and John Deutch for valuable discussions.

This is because the links between energy efficiency and energy access, is often overlooked. This oversight of energy efficiency is frequently a missed opportunity, as efficiency is often a very cost-effective energy resource. In combination with grid expansion and new clean energy generation, efficiency efforts can help to ensure that reliable power is provided to the maximum number of customers at a lower cost than would be required to increase generation alone. In this paper we describe an analysis method for determining a country's energy efficiency priorities and devising an action plan to integrate energy efficiency as a resource for meeting a nation's energy access goals. We illustrate this method with a detailed case study of Uganda. If the most efficient technologies on the market were adopted in Uganda, 442 MW of generation-level demand could be offset and energy access for an additional 6 M rural customers could be achieved by 2030. Of this technical potential for efficiency, 91% is cost-effective, and 47% is economically achievable under conservative assumptions.","[du Can, Stephane de la Rue] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pudleiner, David] ICF Int, Fairfax, VA USA; [Pielli, Katrina] US Agcy Int Dev, Power Africa Initiat, Pretoria, South Africa",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"du Can, SD (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Energy Technol Area, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS 90R2121, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sadelarueducan@lbl.gov,"de la Rue du Can, Stephane/ABI-1794-2020","de la Rue du Can, Stephane/0000-0001-8054-5737",Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy,This work was funded by Power Africa funding under the U.S. Department of Energy Contract no.

Despite the prevalence of such education, there is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy of these programs on tangible outcomes outside of school. This paper contributes an empirical analysis of a series of energy lessons in the United States. Using a differences-in-differences approach with a rich panel data set, we find evidence for short-term reductions on the order of eight percent in electricity use the day of a lesson regarding energy conservation via reducing phantom electric loads (standby power), with evidence of deferment in electricity use rather than true conservation. We find no effect of lessons on energy pathways or wind energy on the days of the lessons. Despite limited evidence of conservation, our results do indicate a connection between lessons learned in school and measurable behavior at home. Importantly, this research indicates that energy education could be a potentially valuable tool for policy regarding energy conservation and efficiency, though future research is needed to optimize the timing and content of such lessons.","[Gill, Carrie; Lang, Corey] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Lang, C (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",cagill@my.uri.edu; clang@uri.edu,,,University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute,University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute,"The authors thank our utility partner and the many employees that helped us understand the data and education programs.

Thus, the supplier needs to monitor the retailer's restocking efforts with the available data. We empirically assess stockout levels using only shipment and sales data that is readily available to the supplier. The model distinguishes between store stockouts (zero inventory in the store) and shelf stockouts (an empty shelf but some inventory in other parts of the store), thereby identifying the cause of the stockout to be either a supply chain or a restocking issue. We find that, as suspected by the supplier, the average stockout rate is much higher than published averages. In addition, stockout rates vary widely between stores. Moreover, almost all stockouts are shelf stockouts.

Household fuel expenditures come from the U.S. Consumer Expenditures Surveys (CES). Costs of increased new passenger car and light truck fuel economy were obtained from four National Research Council (NRC) studies plus a literature review of earlier estimates. The NRC cost functions provide a unique time series of technology supply functions constructed by balanced expert panels and comprised of specific technologies proven to increase fuel economy. Effects of fuel economy improvements on used vehicle prices are based on an analysis of the CES data. Retrospective analysis indicates that all income quintiles received net savings and that the effect on the distribution of income was progressive. A prospective analysis of future fuel economy improvements produced similar results. Sensitivity analysis indicates that these findings are relatively robust.","[Greene, David L.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Welch, Jilleah G.] Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Greene, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dgreen32@utk.edu; jgwelch@utk.edu,"Greene, David/AAB-1183-2021","Greene, David/0000-0002-7667-5376; Welch, Jilleah/0000-0002-0782-549X",Energy Foundation; National Transportation Research Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory,Energy Foundation; National Transportation Research Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory,This work was supported by the Energy Foundation and the National Transportation Research Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.,,57,5,5,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,528,541,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.005,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000447576700049,0

Trade can complement domestic investment to increase the availability and reliability of supply, bringing economies of scale in investments and more cost-effective expansion of renewable electricity. Efforts to expand cross-border electricity cooperation and trade in SAR need to address not only regional barriers, but also barriers stemming from domestic electricity sector policies in the region. Expanding the scope of bilateral electricity cooperation in the short- and medium-term, and especially opening up to commercial as well as government-to government projects, can build confidence in the process of cross-border trade and the potential benefits it can provide.

However price dispersion and limited customer access to PV quotes prevents some prospective customers from obtaining low price offers. This study shows that improved customer access to prices - also known as price transparency - is a potential policy lever for further PV price reductions. We use customer search and strategic pricing theory to show that PV installation companies face incentives to offer lower prices in markets with more price transparency. We test this theoretical framework using a unique residential PV quote dataset. Our results show that installers offer lower prices to customers that are expected to receive more quotes.

As a result, alternative jet fuel (AJF) technologies have garnered interest as a means to achieve large, near-term emissions reductions for the industry. This analysis quantifies the potential for AJF to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions by assessing: the availability of AJF feedstock; AJF volumes that could be produced from that feedstock; the lifecycle emissions of AJF compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel; and the number of bio-refineries and capital investment required to achieve the calculated emission reductions. We find that, if the use of AJF is to reduce aviation's lifecycle GHG emissions by 50% or more by 2050, prices or policies will have to significantly incentivize the production of bioenergy and waste feedstocks, and AJF production will need to be prioritized over other potential uses of these resources. Reductions of 15% by 2050 would require construction of similar to 60 new bio-refineries annually (similar to growth in global biofuel production capacity in the early 2000s), and capital investment of similar to 12 billion USDzois per year (similar to 1/5 of annual capital investment in petroleum refining).","[Staples, Mark D.; Malina, Robert; Suresh, Pooja; Barrett, Steven R.

Following the work of Pollard (1980), our approach uses a Cramer-von Mises minimum distance estimator for parameter estimation. The asymptotic null distribution of the resulting test statistic is represented by invariance principle arguments as a functional of a Brownian bridge in a simple regression format for which asymptotic critical values are readily delivered by simulations. Asymptotic power is examined under fixed and local alternatives and finite sample performance of the test is evaluated in simulations. The test is applied to measure top income shares using Korean income tax return data over 2007-2012. When the data relate to estimating the upper 0.1% or higher income shares, the conventional assumption of a Pareto tail distribution cannot be rejected.

Regional Studies. An extensive literature has emerged in regional studies linking organization-based measures of entrepreneurship (e.g., self-employment, new start-ups) to regional economic performance. A limitation of the extant literature is that the measurement of entrepreneurship is not able to incorporate broader conceptual views, such as behaviour, of what actually constitutes entrepreneurship. This paper fills this gap by linking the underlying and also more fundamental and encompassing entrepreneurship culture of regions to regional economic performance. The empirical evidence suggests that those regions exhibiting higher levels of entrepreneurship culture tend to have higher employment growth. Robustness checks using causal methods confirm this finding. ,Regional Studies. ,(),,,,,, RESUMECulture de entrepreneuriat, retombees du savoir, et l'expansion des regions. Regional Studies. Une documentation importante a vu le jour dans les etudes regionales etablissant le rapport entre d'une part des mesures de l'entrepreneuriat basees sur des organisations (p.ex. travailleurs independants, jeunes entreprises), d'autre part les performances economiques regionales. Une limitation propre a la litterature existante tient au fait que la mesure de l'entrepreneuriat n'est pas en mesure d'incorporer des principes conceptuels plus generaux, comme le comportement, par exemple, sur ce qui constitue effectivement l'entrepreneuriat. La presente communication comble cette lacune, en etablissant un lien entre la culture sous-jacente, mais aussi plus fondamentale et globale, de l'entrepreneuriat, et les performances economiques regionales. Les donnees empiriques semblent indiquer que les regions presentant une culture de l'entrepreneuriat de niveau superieur ont tendance a presenter une croissance superieure de l'emploi. Des controles de robustesse faisant usage de methodes causales confirment cette conclusion. ZUSAMMENFASSUNGUnternehmenskultur, Wissensubertragungen und das Wachstum von Regionen. Regional Studies. In den Regionalwissenschaften sind zahlreiche Studien erschienen, in denen firmenbasierte Ma ss stabe des Unternehmertums (z.B. Selbstandigkeit, neue Firmengrundungen) mit der regionalen Wirtschaftsleistung in Zusammenhang gebracht werden. Eine Einschrankung der vorhandenen Literatur besteht darin, dass bei der Messung des Unternehmertums keine breiteren konzeptuellen - z.B. verhaltensbezogenen - Perspektiven der Frage berucksichtigt werden konnen, was genau Unternehmertum ausmacht. In diesem Beitrag schlie ss en wir diese Lucke, indem wir die zugrundeliegende und au ss erdem grundlegendere und umfassendere Unternehmenskultur von Regionen mit der regionalen Wirtschaftsleistung in Zusammenhang bringen. Den empirischen Belegen zufolge verzeichnen Regionen mit einem hoheren Ma ss an Unternehmenskultur ein tendenziell hoheres Beschaftigungswachstum. Dieses Ergebnis wird durch eine uberprufung auf Robustheit mithilfe kausaler Methoden bestatigt. RESUMENCultura empresarial, difusion de conocimiento y el crecimiento de las regiones. Regional Studies. En los estudios regionales existe una amplia bibliografia que relaciona las medidas de la iniciativa empresarial en el ambito de la organizacion (p. ej., empleo autonomo, nuevas empresas emergentes) con el rendimiento economico regional. Una limitacion de la bibliografia actual es que la medicion de la iniciativa empresarial no es capaz de incorporar perspectivas conceptuales mas amplias, tales como la conducta, de lo que realmente constituye la iniciativa empresarial. En este articulo cubrimos este vacio al vincular la cultura empresarial subyacente y tambien mas fundamental e integral de las regiones con el rendimiento economico regional. La evidencia empirica indica que las regiones que muestran niveles mas altos de cultura empresarial suelen tener un crecimiento de empleo mas alto. Este resultado queda confirmado al medir la solidez mediante metodos causales.","[Stuetzer, Michael] Baden Wuerttemberg Cooperat State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Mannheim, Germany; [Stuetzer, Michael] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Fac Econ Sci & Media, Ilmenau, Germany; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Rentfrow, Peter J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, England; [Potter, Jeff] Atof Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Mannheim; Technische Universitat Ilmenau; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Melbourne; University of Cambridge,"Audretsch, DB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",michael.stuetzer@dhbw-mannheim.de; daudrets@indiana.edu; martin.obschonka@qut.edu.au; gosling@psy.utexas.edu; pjr39@cam.ac.uk; jeff@thebigfiveproject.com,"Gosling, Sam/AAL-5718-2020; Rentfrow, Peter Jason/ABB-9257-2021","Gosling, Sam/0000-0001-8970-591X; Rentfrow, Peter Jason/0000-0002-9068-2118; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166; Stuetzer, Michael/0000-0001-9375-8125",Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung [20.14.0.051],Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung,Financial support by the Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung [Az. number 20.14.0.051] is gratefully acknowledged.,,65,98,118,13,150,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this article, we propose a counting-process-based Bayesian method for quantifying the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns in conjunction with customer characteristics. Our model explicitly addresses the seasonality of data, accounts for the impact of customer characteristics on their purchasing behavior, and evaluates effects of email offers as well as their interactions with customer characteristics. Using the proposed method, together with a propensity-score-based unit-matching technique for alleviating potential confounding, we analyze a large email marketing dataset of an online ticket marketplace to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of their email campaigns. It is shown that email offers can increase customer purchase rate both immediately and during a longer term. Customers' characteristics such as length of shopping history, purchase recency, average ticket price, average ticket count, and number of genres purchased also affect customers' purchase rate. A strong positive interaction is uncovered between email offer and purchase recency, suggesting that customers who have been inactive recently are more likely to take advantage of promotional offers.

The authors conducted statistical analysis on the effects of temperature and constructed an electric vehicle charging model that can show the dynamics of DCFC charging process under different temperatures. The results indicate that DCFC charging rate can deteriorate considerably in cold temperatures. These findings may be used as a reference to identify and assess the regions that may suffer from slow charging. The problems associated with temperature effects on DCFC charging deserve greater attention as electrification of motor vehicles progresses and DCFC usage increases in the future.,"[Motoaki, Yutaka; Salisbury, Shawn] Idaho Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Adv Vehicles, POB 1625,MS 3830, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 USA; [Yi, Wenqi] Cornell Univ, Syst Engn, 204 Rhodes Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Idaho National Laboratory; Cornell University,"Motoaki, Y (通讯作者)，Idaho Natl Lab, Energy Storage & Adv Vehicles, POB 1625,MS 3830, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 USA.",yutaka.motoaki@inl.gov,"Motoaki, Yutaka/B-9011-2017","Motoaki, Yutaka/0000-0003-0768-4583; Yi, Wenqi/0000-0002-3897-0251",Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC07-05ID14517],Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Funding was provided by the Vehicle Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

However, reallocation of water use often generates third-party effects, or externalities, which prohibit transfers. We develop a spatial-dynamic hydro-economic model to assess the gains from redistributing water across irrigators, taking into account externalities that water use transfers may produce. Water use is optimized across space and time such that return flows in various segments of the watershed do not decrease relative to the flows obtained under current water use. Across a suite of water shortage scenarios in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain, the reallocation of water subject to third party externalities generates an 8-16% increase in aggregate annual profit earned by irrigators, relative to the Prior Appropriation-based allocation. The failure to account for the constraints on reallocation that arise due to externalities overstates the benefits from reallocation by 7%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
