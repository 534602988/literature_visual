Choices are not completely consistent with any of the economic theories we consider, however, they are not random either. We use our experimental data to structurally estimate risk preferences and correct for decision error. Using a measure constructed from the estimates and individual choices, we find that risk preferences do predict future field behavior. Children who are more risk averse are less likely to receive disciplinary referrals one and two years after the experiment and are more likely to complete high school, even controlling for economic rationality, family background, scholarly achievement and past misbehavior.

This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of retrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.","[Dobbie, Will] Princeton Univ, Ind Relat Sect, Louis A Simpson Int Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Dobbie, Will; Yang, Crystal S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cioldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, William H.

We identify game niches by genre, age-appropriateness, console system, a release cohort, and publisher. First, we show that games are more likely to be released so as to avoid weeks when their niche already faces competition. Next, we show that consumer substitution across games is stronger within most of the dimensions describing product niches. Sales volumes decay quickly after the opening weekend, so at any point in time, a niche will typically be served by few current titles. From this, we calculate that delaying game release 1 week yields substantial increase in revenue for a video game facing higher-than-average competition.","[Engelstaetter, Benjamin; Ward, Michael R.] Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, Mannheim, Germany; [Engelstaetter, Benjamin] Hsch Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Ward, Michael R.] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Hochschule Darmstadt; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Ward, MR (通讯作者)，Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, Mannheim, Germany.;Ward, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",mikeward@uta.edu,"Ward, Michael/AHC-7709-2022","Ward, Michael/0000-0003-0669-5475",,,,,39,8,8,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In Chinese philosophy, Yin and Yang often represent contradictory yet inseparable opposites - two forces that not merely coexist, but are synergistic and mutually dependent. This concept is an apt analogy for the relationship between innovation and shortage in the health sector. Dangers arise from over-emphasizing the Yin of innovation over the Yang of access, and vice versa. If we over-constrain innovation, we die needlessly early and forfeit quality of life that innovations might have enabled.

However, there are limited studies on identifying the research efforts that will have the largest possible return on investment, resulting in suboptimal returns. Manufacturers commonly measure production time in order to identify areas for efficiency improvement, but this is typically not applied at the national level where efficiency issues may cross between enterprises and industries. Such methods and results can be used to prioritize efficiency improvement efforts at an industry supply-chain level. This paper utilizes data on manufacturing inventory along with data on inter-industry interactions to develop a method for tracking industry-level flow time and identifying bottlenecks in US manufacturing. As a proof of concept, this method is applied to the production of three commodities: aircraft, automobiles/trucks, and computers.

They agree, however, that the core problem is human, not market failure. Their widely held assessment helps explain why the Dodd-Frank banking reform says so much and does so little. This study re-tries the usual suspects and finds none guilty. Instead, it points to multiple equilibria in banking and the overall economy. Whether it is Cooke and Company in 1873 or Lehman Brothers in 2008, and opacity are the wicked brew that stokes bank runs. And bank runs prompt employer runs - laying off your employees (other firms' customers) for fear that others are laying off their employees (your customers). The answer is fundamental, not cosmetic banking reform that fixes banking and the economy for good. The answer is replacing leveraged, trust-me banking with fully transparent, 100 percent equity-financed mutual fund banking. This reform, called Limited Purpose Banking, handles all aspects of finance, including lending, risk allocation and the payment system. It would permanently end the leveraging of taxpayers by banks and bring a permanent end to financial crises.","[Kotlikoff, Laurence] Boston Univ, Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Econometr Soc, Cleveland, OH USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Econ Secur Planning Inc, Lexington, MA 02421 USA",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Econometr Soc, Cleveland, OH USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Econ Secur Planning Inc, Lexington, MA 02421 USA.",kotlikoff@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

To understand this process, we propose a conceptual framework in which the introduction of religious competition shifts political markets where religious authorities provide legitimacy to rulers in exchange for control over resources. Consistent with our framework, religious competition changed the balance of power between secular and religious elites: secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation, particularly in Protestant regions. This transfer of resources had significant consequences. First, it shifted the allocation of upper-tail human capital. Graduates of Protestant universities increasingly took secular, especially administrative, occupations. Protestant university students increasingly studied secular subjects, especially degrees that prepared students for public sector jobs, rather than church sector specific theology. Second, it affected the sectoral composition of fixed investment. Particularly in Protestant regions, new construction shifted from religious toward secular purposes, especially the building of palaces and administrative buildings, which reflected the increased wealth and power of secular lords. Reallocation was not driven by preexisting economic or cultural differences. Our findings indicate that the Reformation played an important causal role in the secularization of the West.","[Cantoni, Davide] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany; CESIfo, Munich, Germany; London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Cantoni, D (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany.",,,,Marie Curie Career Integration Grant; European Research Council from the European Union [638957]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [638957] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(Marie Curie Actions); European Research Council from the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor, Robert Barro, and four anonymous referees for valuable feedback.

The baseline model, which is a direct extension of Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) model of industry dynamics, can account for the macroeconomic rates of entry and exit over the business cycle observed in the U.S. data. It cannot, however, account for the microeconomic characteristics of entering plants. Assuming that entry costs are cyclical can resolve this inconsistency between the model and the data. We also show that this pattern of entry costs can arise from an endogenous mechanism. The business cycle results are robust when we extend the model to incorporate plant life cycle features.

However, traders' acquisition cost of information has typically been ignored. Results from a laboratory experiment involving six treatments varying the cost of acquiring signals of an asset's value suggest that when information is costly, markets do not succeed in aggregating it. At an individual level, having information improves trading performance, but not enough to offset the cost of obtaining the information. Although males earn more through trading than females, this differential is offset by the greater propensity of males to buy information such that total profit is similar for males and females. Looking at individual skills, we find that higher theory of mind is associated with greater trading profit, greater overall profit, and an increased likelihood of acquiring information while cognitive reflection is associated with greater profit but not a greater propensity to acquire information.

It models individual i's honesty standard as a profile of (possibly non-empty) collections of ordered pairs of outcomes, one for each member of society, over which individual i feels truth-telling concerns. Individual i is honest provided that she states her true preferences as well as rankings (not necessarily complete) of outcomes that are consistent with the true preferences of individuals in her honesty standard. Under this notion of honesty, we offer a condition, called S(N)-partial-honesty monotonicity, which is necessary for Nash implementation when there are partially-honest agents. In an independent domain of preferences, we show that this condition is equivalent to Maskin monotonicity provided that honesty means stating the orderings of individuals (in a honesty standard) truthfully and individuals' honesty standards are non-connected.

In this setting, we find that the big four eurozone economies (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) can effectively escape from their liquidity trap through fiscal policy interventions caused by government purchases. We estimate the government spending multiplier to be above 1.8 when this policy is associated with a long-term commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate at the zero lower bound, as suggested by Krugman (1998). Notably, the short-term deficit effect on the budget balance can be offset five years after the implementation of a large spending program. We also show that alternative policies with tax cuts that expand the supply do not appear to have the same power in the short run. Moreover, we provide novel empirical evidence that a large government debt renders a government spending policy ineffective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Because the literature identifies the impact of long-term exposure to economics instruction (e.g., taking a course), it cannot isolate the specific course content responsible; nor can selection, peer effects, or other confounds be properly controlled for. In a laboratory experiment, we use a within-and across-subject design to identify the impact of brief, randomly-assigned economics lessons on behavior in the ultimatum game (UG), dictator game (DG), prisoner's dilemma (PD), and public-goods game (PGG). We find that a brief lesson that includes the assumptions of self-interest and strategic considerations moves behavior toward traditional economic rationality in UG, PD, and DG. Despite entering the study with higher levels of selfishness than others, subjects with prior exposure to economics instruction have similar training effects. We show that the lesson reduces efficiency and increases inequity in the UG. The results demonstrate that even brief exposure to commonplace neoclassical economics assumptions measurably moves behavior toward self-interest.","[Ifcher, John] Santa Clara Univ, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Zarghamee, Homa] Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA",Santa Clara University,"Zarghamee, H (通讯作者)，Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jifcher@scu.edu; hzargham@barnard.edu,,"Ifcher, John/0000-0002-3491-8288",,,,,22,10,10,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

I model demand for the product at monetary and non-monetary prices. The model illustrates that monetary prices screen out the poor and that whether non monetary prices screen out the non-poor is theoretically ambiguous because of opposing income and substitution effects. I find monetary prices select richer households and non-monetary prices do not provide strong selection on income. Both the poor and non-poor appear very elastic in the non-monetary price because of the high value of time in home production. I evaluate the problem of a principal with a fixed budget whose objective places some weight on coverage and some weight on targeting. Despite better targeting with non-monetary prices, the principal optimally chooses a monetary price for a large range of parameters.","[Hoffmann, Bridget] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Hoffmann, B (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",Bridgeth@IADB.org,,,Russell Sage Foundation [RSF] [98-13-041]; Buffett Center at Northwestern University; Graduate School at Northwestern University; Center for the Study of Development Economics at Northwestern University,Russell Sage Foundation [RSF]; Buffett Center at Northwestern University; Graduate School at Northwestern University; Center for the Study of Development Economics at Northwestern University,"I am grateful to Treb Allen, Lori Beaman, Samuel Berlinski, Ofer Cohen, Julian Cristia, Matthias Doepke, Joel Gamoran, Seema Jayachandran, Cynthia Kinnan, Chris Lau, Lee Lockwood, and Juan D.

We show that the size and distribution of income shocks drives expenditure change in a manner that varies profoundly across traded goods. Our estimates of expenditure shares and income elasticities could be useful in many applications that seek to explain changes in trade behavior from the demand side, and indicate the strong sensitivity of trade to changes in the tails of the income distribution. We explore an application involving the Great Trade Collapse. Income-induced expenditure changes are positively correlated with the cross-good pattern of import changes, generating a predicted change as much as 40% as large as the raw variation in import declines.

Let y be an outcome of interest and let (x=k, w=j) be observed patient covariates. Suppose a clinician wants to choose a care option that maximizes a patient's expected utility conditional on the observed covariates. To accomplish this, the clinician needs to know the conditional probability distribution P(y|x=k, w=j). It is common to have a trustworthy evidence-based risk assessment that predicts y conditional on a subset of the observed covariates, say x, but not conditional on (x, w). Then the clinician knows P(y|x=k) but not P(y|x=k, w=j). Research on the ecological inference problem studies partial identification of P(y|x, w) given knowledge of P(y|x) and P(w|x). Combining this knowledge with structural assumptions yields tighter conclusions. A psychological literature comparing actuarial predictions and clinical judgments has concluded that clinicians should not attempt to subjectively predict patient outcomes conditional on covariates that are not utilized in evidence-based risk assessments. I argue that formalizing clinical judgment through analysis of the identification problem can improve risk assessments and care decisions.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,50,12,13,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We employ rich longitudinal registry data covering the entire Norwegian population between the years 1970 and 2009 and show that a parsimonious set of family and municipality characteristics, measured in childhood, can explain a substantial part of the gender gap in full-time employment. The characteristics primarily operate through their impact on female (not male) employment. Children raised in high gender gap conditions (low-educated parents, non-working mother and raised in a municipality at the highest decile for Christian Democrat voter support and lowest decile in maternal employment rates) demonstrate an employment gender gap almost four times larger than those raised in low gap conditions. Our key childhood characteristics are also related to other career indicators (education, earnings, age at first marriage, age at first childbirth, being the primary breadwinner) in a way that is consistent with the transfer of gender norms. Thus, the gender employment gap appears to be shaped by intergenerational transfers of norms even in one of the most gender equal societies in the world.","[Haaland, Venke Furre; Rege, Mari] Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Telle, Kjetil] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Kongensgt 6, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Votruba, Mark] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; Statistics Norway; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Haaland, VF (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",venke.f.haaland@uis.no; mari.rege@uis.no; tel@ssb.no; mark.votruba@case.edu,"Haaland, Venke Furre/AAQ-7432-2021; Votruba, Mark Edward/KAM-6544-2024","Votruba, Mark Edward/0000-0002-4870-3376; Rege, Mari/0000-0002-9574-5851",Norwegian Research Council [OF-10018],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful to Hege Kitterod, Marit Ronsen, a number of seminar participants and the Editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Previous research has found many negative consequences of food insecurity for families and households but has not examined its relationship with housing instability. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, difference-in-difference models show that food insecurity is associated with housing instability. The association remains statistically significant after accounting for potential selection and unobserved heterogeneity using propensity score matching and excluding households that experienced prior housing instability from the sample. Examining potential mediating factors, I find that material hardship explains about half of this association. These findings suggest that maintaining a strong social safety net would reduce the risk that families experience material hardship and housing instability, which may also reduce the risk of homelessness.","[King, Christian] Univ Nebraska, Dept Nutr & Hlth Sci, 104I Ruth Leverton Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"King, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Nutr & Hlth Sci, 104I Ruth Leverton Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",cking7@unl.edu,"King, Christian/D-8122-2016","King, Christian/0000-0003-1157-5734",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [R01 HD36916],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"I would like to thank Greg Lewis and Sara Markowitz for their helpful comments and suggestions on an early draft.

The returns to experience accumulated in an immigrant's birth country before migrating are positively correlated with birth-country GDP per capita. To understand this fact, we build a model of life-cycle human capital accumulation that features three potential theories: differential human capital accumulation, differential selection, and differential skill loss. We use new data on the characteristics of immigrants and nonmigrants from a large set of countries to distinguish between these theories. The most likely theory is that immigrants from poor countries accumulate less human capital in their birth countries before migrating. Our findings imply that life-cycle human capital stocks are much larger in rich countries.","[Lagakos, David; Porzio, Tommaso] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lagakos, David; Moll, Benjamin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moll, Benjamin] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Porzio, Tommaso] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Qian, Nancy] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Qian, Nancy] Bur Res Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [Schoellman, Todd] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve System - USA,"Lagakos, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Lagakos, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,31,12,15,2,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

We find that official survey-based measures vastly under-estimate the rise of inequality since 1990. According to our benchmark estimates, top income shares are now similar to (or higher than) the levels observed in the United States. We also find that inequality has increased substantially more in Russia than in China and other ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe. We relate this finding to the specific transition strategy followed in Russia. According to our benchmark estimates, the wealth held offshore by rich Russians is about three times larger than official net foreign reserves, and is comparable in magnitude to total household financial assets held in Russia.","[Novokmet, Filip; Piketty, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Zucman, Gabriel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Zucman, Gabriel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Paris School of Economics; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Novokmet, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",filip.novokmet@psemail.eu; piketty@psemail.eu; zucman@berkeley.edu,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019","Novokmet, Filip/0000-0001-9352-0344","European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Program, ERC [340831]","European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Program, ERC(European Research Council (ERC))","We are grateful to the editors, Facundo Alvaredo and Cecilia Garcia Penalosa, as well as to Sergei Guriev, Branko Milanovic, Ruslan Yemtsov, Gerard Roland, Petr Fedorov, seminar participants at EBRD, Northwestern University, Stanford University and the Moscow Financial Forum for helpful comments.

It establishes theoretically and empirically that distance to the frontier had a persistent non-monotonic effect on a country's pre-industrial economic development. In particular, advancing a novel measure of the travel time to the technological frontiers, the analysis establishes a robust persistent U-shaped relation between distance to the frontier and pre-industrial economic development across countries. Moreover, it demonstrates that countries, which throughout the last two millennia were relatively more distant from these frontiers, have higher contemporary levels of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, suggesting that distance from the frontier may have fostered the emergence of a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship.","[Ozak, Omer] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, POB 0496, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Özak, Ö (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, POB 0496, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",ozak@smu.edu,"Özak, Ömer/AAA-6787-2020; Özak, Ömer/IAR-1731-2023","Özak, Ömer/0000-0001-6421-2801;",,,,,84,19,20,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

We construct a tractable theoretical framework where each player has the opportunity to distort the true public signal and each player is uncertain about the distortion technologies available to the other player. We show that when players evaluate strategies according to their worst-case guarantees i.e., are ambiguity averse over certain distributions in the environment perceived continuation payoffs endogenously lie on a positively sloped line. We then provide examples showing that, counterintuitively, identifying deviators can be harmful in enforcing a strategy profile; moreover, we illustrate how the presence of such signal distortion can sustain cooperation when it is impossible in standard settings. We show that the main result and examples are robust to a number of natural modifications to our setting. Finally, we extend our model to a repeated game where our concept is a natural generalization of strongly symmetric equilibria. In this setting, we prove an anti-folk theorem, showing that payoffs under our equilibrium concept are under general conditions bounded away from efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We apply both a structural modeling approach based on the conduct parameter and a reduced-form regression analysis using different fixed effects. Identification comes from rebate level stepwise changes within each of the three major electric utilities in California and different rebate levels across the utilities. The results from both approaches suggest an average pass-through rate of direct incentives of nearly 100%, though with minor regional differences among California counties.

Under the axioms, we uniquely identify from the choices an expected utility function that represents the decision maker's true preference and a propensity function that describes how likely an alternative is to be chosen. We introduce a measure of error-proneness and show that the logit model of mistakes is a CMM with a constant measure of error-proneness, characterized by a strong version of the independence axiom from expected utility theory. We analyze the properties of models of mistakes.","[Ke, Shaowei] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Ke, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",shaoweik@umich.edu,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper examines whether this policy is desirable. The optimal UI replacement rate is the Baily-Chetty replacement rate plus a correction term measuring the effect of UI on welfare through labor market tightness. Empirical evidence suggests that tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms, and that an increase in UI raises tightness. Hence, the correction term is positive in slumps but negative in booms, and optimal UI is indeed countercyclical.

We develop a new methodology to separate firm borrowing shocks from bank supply shocks using a vast sample of matched bank-firm lending data. We decompose aggregate loan movements in Japan for the period 1990-2010 into bank, firm, industry, and common shocks. The high degree of financial institution concentration means that individual banks are large relative to the size of the economy, which creates a role for granular shocks as in Gabaix's (2011) study.

We review the recent research trying to explain this phenomenon. After briefly revisiting gender differences in education, we turn our attention to a body of work that has argued that gender differences in psychological attributes are holding back women's earnings. We then review another active area of research focused on the challenges that women may face when trying to juggle competing demands on their time in the workplace and the home, particularly when the home includes children. We discuss recent work documenting women's greater demand for flexibility in the workplace, as well as work measuring the labour market penalties associated with such demand for flexibility, particularly in the higher paying occupations in the economy. We highlight possible countervailing forces (both at work and at home) that may explain why these work-family considerations may remain highly relevant to today's glass ceiling despite reduced time spent in non-market work and a trend towards a more equal division of non-market work between men and women. Finally, we discuss the role that public policy and human resource practices may play in adding more cracks to the glass ceiling.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,50,72,90,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2018,85,338,,,,,205,231,,10.1111/ecca.12264,0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FY0KF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000426499200001,0

This ability to absorb shocks along both margins alters the household's attitudes toward risk, as shown by Swanson (2012). In the present paper, I extend that analysis to the case of generalized recursive preferences, as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989), including multiplier preferences, as in Hansen and Sargent (2001). Understanding risk aversion for these preferences is important because they are a primary mechanism being used to bring macroeconomic models into closer agreement with asset prices. Traditional, fixed-labor measures of risk aversion show no stable relationship to the equity premium in a standard macroeconomic model, while the closed-form expressions I derive here match the equity premium closely.

We find that in a long run stationary environment, replacing the taxation of Social Security benefits with a revenue-equivalent change in the payroll tax would increase labor supply, consumption, and welfare.

A monopolistic information provider may supply imprecise information to perfectly competitive firms, even if the precision of this information can be increased at no cost.

The competition drives down the monopoly's rents, and as a result, the short position becomes profitable and covers the cost of entry. If entry is impossible, then the speculator may coordinate and pay the firm's counter-parties to stop trading with the monopoly rather than entering. In either case, increasing a speculator's ability to short a firm's rents results in a constraint on the monopoly and forces it to act more like a price taker. Although we are unaware of such a mechanism being attempted in practice, it does provide a potential market based approach to antitrust regulation.

Importantly, we disentangle the effects of corporate income taxation from the tax advantage of patent boxes and exploit a new and original dataset on patent box features such as the conditionality on performing research in the country or their coverage. We find that patent boxes have a considerable effect on attracting patents, mostly because of their favourable tax treatment. Patents with high earnings potential are particularly sensitive. Patent boxes with a large coverage also have stronger effects on the location of patents.

Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations. This suggests that international arbitrage is potentially important.","[Foellmi, Reto] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Foellmi, Reto; Josef, Zweimuller] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Hepenstrick, Christian] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hepenstrick, Christian; Josef, Zweimuller] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Josef, Zweimuller] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Josef, Zweimuller] IZA, Munich, Germany",University of St Gallen; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Zurich; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Foellmi, R (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.;Foellmi, R (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",Reto.foellmi@unisg.ch,"Foellmi, Reto/A-2727-2008",,"Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CRSI11_132272, CRSII1_154446]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CRSI11_132272, CRSII1_154446] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank Sandro Favre, Patrick DeCaes, Stefan Legge, Damian Osterwalder, and Marco Schmid for excellent research assistance.

Social learning provides public information, to which players overreact due to the coordination motive. Coordination affects the aggregation of private signals through players' optimal choices. Such endogenous provision of public information results in informational cascades and thus inefficient herds, with positive probability, even if private signals have an unbounded likelihood ratio property. An extension shows that if players can individually learn, there exists an equilibrium in which inefficient herding disappears, and thus, coordination is almost surely successful.","[Huang, Chong] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Huang, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",chong.h@uci.edu,,"Huang, Chong/0000-0002-0208-4282",,,,,25,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This topic has not been explored thoroughly at the aggregate level, mainly due to endogeneity of remittances and the difficulty in finding instruments to resolve this issue. To address the endogeneity of remittances, I estimate bilateral remittances and use them to create weighted indicators of remittance-sending countries. These weighted indicators are used as instruments for remittance inflow to remittance-receiving countries. Results obtained in this study indicate that remittances raise per capita health expenditures and reduce undernourishment prevalence, depth of food deficit, prevalence of stunting, and child mortality rate. Remittances also raise school enrollment, school completion rate, and private school enrollment. Although there is no difference in the impact of remittances on the health outcome of boys and girls, remittances improve the educational outcome of girls more than the educational outcome of boys. Further, remittances decrease the female labor force participation rate but do not affect the male labor force participation rate.","[Azizi, SeyedSoroosh] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Azizi, S (通讯作者)，Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",sazizi1@niu.edu,"Azizi, Seyedsoroosh/AAK-4515-2021","Azizi, Seyedsoroosh/0000-0002-6651-9855",,,,,66,89,97,3,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using data from the Portuguese manufacturing sector, we find that: (1) firms with longer spells of activity in export destinations tend to ship larger quantities at lower prices; (2) older exporters tend to use more expensive inputs; (3) the volatility of output and input prices tends to decline with export experience; and (4) input prices and quantities tend to increase with revenue growth within firms.

Bank linkages are measured for each pair of countries in each year as a number of bank pairs in these two countries that are connected through cross-border syndicated lending. Using a gravity approach to model trade for 66 countries over 24 years with a full set of fixed effects (source-year, target-year, source-target), we find that new connections between banks in a given country-pair lead to an increase in trade flows between these countries in the following year and to trade diversions from countries competing for similar imports. We conjecture that the mechanism for this effect is the role bank linkages play in reducing export risk and present evidence supporting this conjecture. In particular, using industry-level trade data and controlling for country-pair-year and industry fixed effects, we find that new bank linkages have larger impacts on trade in industries which tend to be subject to more export risk. For U.S. banks, we can show that bank linkages are positively associated with foreign letter of credit exposures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that insurgents undermine the state's mandate through electoral violence. We study insurgent violence during elections using newly declassified microdata on the conflict in Afghanistan. Our data track insurgent activity by hour to within meters of attack locations. Our results suggest that insurgents carefully calibrate their production of violence during elections to avoid harming civilians. Leveraging a novel instrumental variables approach, we find that violence depresses voting. Collectively, the results suggest insurgents try to depress turnout while avoiding backlash from harming civilians.

For this purpose, we present the Global Preference Survey (GPS), an experimentally validated survey data set of time preference, risk preference, positive and negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust from 80,000 people in 76 countries. The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and biogeo-graphic and cultural variables, such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labormarket choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.","[Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Harvard Univ, BRIQ Inst Behav & Inequal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Inst Labor Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Natl Bur Econ Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Bonn; Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Munich,"Falk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Dohmen, Thomas/0000-0002-9321-0319",,,,,87,605,652,25,275,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We measure bias using class-gender differences in scores between school exams graded by teachers and national exams graded blindly by external examiners. For identification, we rely on the random assignment of teachers and students to classes in primary schools. Our results suggest that assignment to a teacher with a greater bias in favor of girls (boys) has positive effects on girls' (boys') achievements. Such gender biases have also positive impact on girls' (boys') enrollment in advanced level math courses in high school. These results suggest that teachers' biased behavior at early stages of schooling has long run implications for occupational choices and earnings at adulthood, because enrollment in advanced courses in math and science in high school is a prerequisite for post-secondary schooling in engineering, computer science and so on.

Nevertheless, development finance institutions still lack sound and transparent metrics to assess their projects' exposure to climate risks and their impact on global climate action. To attempt to fill this gap, we develop a novel climate stress-test methodology for portfolios of loans to energy infrastructure projects. We apply the methodology to the portfolios of overseas energy projects of two main Chinese policy banks. We estimate their exposure to economic and financial shocks that would result in government inability to introduce timely 2 degrees C-aligned climate policies and from investors' inability to adapt their business to the changing climate and policy environment. We find that the negative shocks are mostly concentrated on coal and oil projects and vary across regions from 4.2 to 22 percent of the total loan value. Given the current leverage of Chinese policy banks, these losses could induce severe financial distress, with implications on macroeconomic and financial stability.","[Monasterolo, Irene] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Monasterolo, Irene] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zheng, Jiani I.; Battiston, Stefano] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Boston University; University of Zurich,"Monasterolo, I (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.;Monasterolo, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",irenemon@bu.edu; isabelle.zheng@bf.uzh.ch; Stefano.battiston@uzh.ch,"battiston, stefano/M-1612-2017; battiston, stefano/I-2624-2012","battiston, stefano/0000-0002-0051-973X",Global Development Policy Center at Boston University; Swiss National Fund Professorship [PP00P1-144689]; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth [649186]; Institute of New Economic Thinking through the Task Force in Macroeconomic Efficiency and Stability,Global Development Policy Center at Boston University; Swiss National Fund Professorship; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth; Institute of New Economic Thinking through the Task Force in Macroeconomic Efficiency and Stability,"Irene Monasterolo (corresponding author), Assistant Professor, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Austria and Visiting Fellow, Boston University, USA.

We use this insight to bound the treatment effect variance of school systems and associated neighborhoods for various outcomes. Across multiple datasets, we find that a ninetieth versus tenth percentile school/neighborhood increases the high school graduation probability and college enrollment probability by at least 0.04 and 0.11 and permanent wages by 13.7 percent.","[Altonji, Joseph G.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, POB 208264, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mansfield, Richard K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 04B Econ Bldg, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Yale University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Altonji, JG (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, POB 208264, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",joseph.altonji@yale.edu; richard.mansfield@colorado.edu,,"Mansfield, Richard/0000-0003-0801-598X",Russell Sage Foundation; Yale Economics Growth Center,Russell Sage Foundation; Yale Economics Growth Center,"Altonji: Department of Economics, Yale University, PO Box 208264, New Haven, CT 06520 (email: joseph.altonji@yale.edu); Mansfield: Department of Economics, University of Colorado-Boulder, 04B Economics Building, Boulder, CO 80309 (email: richard.mansfield@colorado.edu).

It employs sign restrictions to identify four external structural shocks - demand, supply, monetary and commodity shocks, and relates their impact to countries' policy and structural framework. External shocks account for a small share of the variance of GDP, especially at short horizons. However, their relative contribution has risen in recent decades, as the incidence of domestic shocks has declined. Global monetary shocks have become the leading external source of GDP volatility in developing countries. At short horizons, real and financial openness raise the share of volatility attributable to external shocks. At longer horizons, financial openness helps reduce the volatility contribution of global real shocks, but not that of global monetary shocks, thus augmenting the relative role of the latter. Commodity-intensive countries exhibit higher vulnerability to all types of external shocks, not just commodity shocks.","[Barrot, Luis-Diego; Calderon, Cesar; Serven, Luis] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Servén, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lserven@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,20,20,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Counterfactual experiments conducted in an estimated model reveal that the US economy would have been substantially more volatile over the Great Inflation and Great Moderation periods if US debt levels had been those observed in Italy or Japan.","[Eusepi, Stefano] Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Preston, Bruce] Univ Melbourne, FBE Bldg,111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of Melbourne,"Eusepi, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",stefano.eusepi@ny.frb.org; bruce.preston@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [FT130101599]; Australian Research Council [FT130101599] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Martin Eichenbaum, Coeditor.

This decline is most pronounced in states with entrenched gender bias and in male-headed parties, suggesting an intensification of barriers against women in these areas.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2015, the paper explores the varieties of existing Chinese manufacturing investment and the sectors into which Chinese companies are investing. We demonstrate in this paper that Chinese manufacturing investment in Africa is indeed expanding rapidly, yet the official data on investment approvals, both in China and in African countries, significantly overstates the actual number of investments in operation. Several investors do fit the model of Akamatsu's` flying geese': large firms seeking new locations for production as part of global networks and value chains. However, we also identified three other kinds of 'geese': large, strategic, local market-seeking geese; raw material-seeking geese; and small geese travelling together in flocks. The different kinds of firms offer different kinds of development opportunities and challenges for structural transformation in Africa.","[Brautigam, Deborah] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tang Xiaoyang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Modern Int Relat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Ying] Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA USA",Johns Hopkins University; Tsinghua University; Harvard University,"Brautigam, D (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",dbrautigam@jhu.edu,,,Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Department for International Development (DFID); AERC; ESRC [ES/M004074/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Department for International Development (DFID); AERC; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is an output from the research initiative 'Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries' (PEDL), a programme funded jointly by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and the Department for International Development (DFID) and administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute.

A large literature in management and economics suggests that competition between firms may be softened as a result of multimarket contact-i.e., firms competing with one another in multiple markets simultaneously. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in multimarket contact generated by out-of-market consolidation, I find that increases in multimarket contact over the 2000-2010 period led to higher hospital prices. These results suggest that continued hospital consolidation may produce higher prices even if that consolidation only minimally affects within-market concentration.","[Schmitt, Matt] UCLA Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza D513, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Schmitt, M (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza D513, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",matthew.schmitt@anderson.ucla.edu,,,,,,,33,21,29,4,23,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

We further show that compared with the simultaneous first-price auction, the leader's optimal commitment yields the same net utility benefit to both of these bidders. As a result, the two highest valued bidders' incentives are aligned, facilitating coordination and implementation of the commitment.

The illicit retail trade in cigarettes (IRTC) includes counterfeit, untaxed, and smuggled cigarettes. Some existing literature includes claims that taxes are not an important determinant of IRTC. Using data from the European Union, we find the opposite: raising prices leads to substantial increases in IRTC. A Euro1 increase in tax/pack is expected to increase illicit market share by 5 to 12 percentage points and increase illicit cigarette sales by 29% to 95%. The results are robust to alternative specifications and data.

Some examples include warfare between countries, competition between political parties, team-incentives within firms, and rent-seeking. In order to succeed, members of the same group have incentives to cooperate with each other by expending effort. However, since effort is costly, each member also has an incentive to abstain from expending any effort and instead free ride on the efforts of other members. Contest theory predicts that the intensity of competition between groups and the amount of free riding within groups depend on the group size, sharing rule, group impact function, contest success function, and heterogeneity of players. We review experimental studies testing these theoretical predictions. Most studies find significant over-expenditure of effort relative to the theory and significant heterogeneity of behavior within and between groups. Also, most studies find support for the comparative statics predictions of the theory (with the exception of the group size paradox). Finally, studies show that there are effective mechanisms that can promote within-group cooperation and conflict resolution mechanisms that can de-escalate and potentially eliminate between-group conflict.","[Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",rms246@case.edu,,,,,,,147,49,50,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We document that senators early in the order are less likely to vote with the majority of their own party than those whose last name places them at the end of the alphabet. To speak to the mechanism behind this result, we develop a simple model of sequential voting, in which forward-looking senators rely on backward induction in order to free ride on their colleagues. Estimating our model structurally, we find that this form of strategic behavior is an important part of equilibrium play.

In doing so, we also test the Beckerian prediction that at the same level of expected payoff, a low probability of detection with high fine is a stronger deterrent to corruption than a high probability of detection with low fine. In Experiment 1, two treatments are designed to study the effect of a low probability of detection with high fine and a high probability of detection with low fine, on bribe taking behavior. In Experiment 2, subjects participate in the same baseline harassment bribery game either without or after having gone through a four-week ethics education program. Results show that: (a) a low probability of detection with high fine reduces both the amount and the likelihood of bribe demand, (b) a high probability of detection with low fine has no effect on bribe demand, (c) normative appeals of ethics education has a small effect on the likelihood but not on the amount of bribe demand, when measured immediately after the intervention, (d) the effect of ethics education vanishes when measured four weeks after the intervention.

We conducted a 10-day randomized experiment with 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya, testing two elements of social welfare design: workfare versus welfare and restricted versus unrestricted vouchers. Participants were randomly assigned to a Work condition, involving daily work for unrestricted vouchers, or one of two Wait conditions, involving daily waiting for vouchers that were either unrestricted or partially restricted to staple foods. We find that working improved psychological wellbeing relative to waiting, suggesting that the means of implementing welfare programs may have important effects on individuals beyond the impact of monetary benefit alone. Furthermore, although the restrictions were inframarginal, partially restricted vouchers crowded-in spending on staple foods, suggesting the existence of a flypaper effect in spending from restricted vouchers.

This variation in treatment effects is consistent with a simple theoretical model that predicts that when agents are already incented at the margin, the quantity-quality trade-off resulting from performance pay is less prominent.","Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Charles River Associates Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada",Lingnan University; Nanyang Technological University; University of Toronto; University of Chicago; Charles River Associates,"Hong, FH (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hongfh@gmail.com,,"List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848; Hong, Fuhai/0000-0001-8681-4926",SSHRC [489160]; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,"We thank Raj Chetty, Aureo de Paula, Florian Englmaier, Ying Fan, April Franco, Avi Goldfarb, Matthew Grennan, Nicola Lacetera, Magne Mogstad, Stephanie Rosch, Justin Sydnor, and many conference and seminar participants for very useful comments.

Hence, a theoretically consistent measure of monetary aggregates for the European Monetary Union (EMU) is needed. This paper analyzes aggregation over monetary assets for the EMU. We aggregate over the monetary services for the eleven EMU (EMU-11) countries, which include Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia. We adopt the Divisia monetary aggregation approach, which is consistent with index number theory and microeconomic aggregation theory. The result is a multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate, in accordance with Barnett (J Econ 136(2):457-482, 2007). The multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate for the EMU-11 is found to be more informative and a better signal of economic trends than the corresponding simple sum aggregate. We then analyze substitutability among monetary assets for the EMU-11 within the framework of a representative consumer's utility function, using Barnett's (J Bus Econ Stat 1:7-23, 1983) locally flexible functional form, the minflex Laurent indirect utility function. The analysis of elasticities with respect to the asset's user-cost prices shows that: (i) transaction balances and deposits with agreed maturity are income elastic and (ii) the monetary assets are not good substitutes for each other within the EMU-11. Simple sum monetary aggregation assumes that component assets are perfect substitutes. Hence simple sum aggregation distorts measurement of the monetary aggregate. The ECB provides Divisia monetary aggregates to the Governing Council at its meetings, but not to the public. Our European Divisia monetary aggregates will be expanded and refined, in collaboration with Wenjuan Chen at the Humboldt University of Berlin, to a complete EMU Divisia monetary aggregates database to be supplied to the public by the Center for Financial Stability in New York City.","[Barnett, William A.; Gaekwad, Neepa B.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Barnett, William A.] Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA",University of Kansas,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Barnett@ku.edu,"Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022",,,,,,37,7,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This mechanism parsimoniously accounts for the postwar comovement in investment, stock prices, leverage, and payout, at both business cycle and medium term cycle frequencies.

While lotteries and provision points both reduce free-riding, they do not completely eliminate the free-riding incentive of individuals, often leaving the good unprovided. In the search for a mechanism that works better, we propose the use of a lottery along with a threshold requirement and test it in a laboratory experimental setup against the popular provision point mechanism. We find that a lottery involving a small prize and a threshold outperforms the provision point mechanism by increasing the average amount of contributions and the frequency of provision. We further test an extension of our mechanism that is well-suited for situations with multiple public goods. The mechanism is designed to avoid monetary prizes associated with lotteries, preventing legal complications and diversion of funds from the public good production. It also has the advantage of easing coordination among the potential donors trying to meet the threshold. The findings confirm that the new mechanism may improve the efficiency of private provision of public goods and have implications for crowdfunding websites with varying rates of project failure, arising partially from their reliance on provision point mechanisms.","[Bose, Bijetri] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rabotyagov, Sergey] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bose, Bijetri] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, 621 Charles E Young Dr S,2203-LSB, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Bose, B (通讯作者)，Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bijetri@uw.edu,,"Bose, Bijetri/0000-0001-6239-7566",USDA NIFA [2012-85101-20472],USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),The authors are grateful for the financial support from the USDA NIFA (2012-85101-20472).,,46,2,2,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

It is generally acknowledged that this theory, which relates the extent of trade between countries to their respective sizes, distances, and relative trade barriers, was first developed by Jan Tinbergen in 1962. Acceptance of the gravity model as part of the discipline's core was limited by its scant theoretical foundation for the first 40 years of its existence. This paper finds that a theory of trade gravity was first developed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. Moreover, it is shown that Smith's statement of a proportional relation between economic size and distance came about as an application of his general theory of differential capital productivity in different economic sectors, and his elaboration of a theory of the gains from trade originated by David Hume. It is further shown that Smith had an explanation of the size of border affects in trade volumes, and a gravity theory of trade restrictions.","[Elmslie, Bruce] Univ New Hampshire, Paul Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Elmslie, B (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Paul Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",bte@unh.edu,,,,,,,35,6,8,0,3,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Various methods have been considered to treat this type of data. One approach assumes that the data correspond to the interval midpoint and then utilizes ordinary least squares to estimate the model. Another approach is to use maximum likelihood estimation, assuming that the underlying variable of interest is normally distributed. In the case of distributional misspecification, these estimation approaches can yield inconsistent estimators. In this paper, we explore a method that can help reduce the misspecification problem by assuming a distribution that can model a wide variety of distributional characteristics, including possible heteroskedasticity. The method is applied to the problem of estimating the impact of various explanatory factors associated with individual discount rates in a field experiment. Our analysis suggests that the underlying distribution of discount rates exhibits skewness, but not heteroskedasticity, In this example, the findings based on a normal distribution are generally robust across distributions.","[McDonald, James; Stoddard, Olga; Walton, Daniel] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 130 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Stoddard, O (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 130 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",olga.stoddard@byu.edu,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Using OLS and instrumental variable methods, we find that each additional year of schooling in Tanzania increases earnings, on average, by 9 to 11%. We find that on average individuals underestimate returns to schooling by 74 to 79% and three factors are associated with these misperceptions: income, asset, poverty and educational attainment.

When the incumbent governor is term limited, there is greater uncertainty over the outcome, providing an instrument to demonstrate this effect is causal, not simply coincidental. Moreover, manufacturing investment does not rebound following the election. Rather, own-state uncertainty is associated with a large and significant coincident rise in neighboring states' investment.

This depends crucially on the costs of inflation. An important concern is that high inflation will lead to inefficient price dispersion. Workhorse New Keynesian models imply that this cost of inflation is very large. An increase in steady-state inflation from 0% to 10% yields a welfare loss that is an order of magnitude greater than the welfare loss from business cycle fluctuations in output in these models. We assess this prediction empirically using a new data set on price behavior during the Great Inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States. If price dispersion increases rapidly with inflation, we should see the absolute size of price changes increasing with inflation: price changes should become larger as prices drift further from their optimal level at higher inflation rates. We find no evidence that the absolute size of price changes rose during the Great Inflation. This suggests that the standard New Keynesian analysis of the welfare costs of inflation is wrong and its implications for the optimal inflation rate need to be reassessed. We also find that (nonsale) prices have not become more flexible over the past 40 years.","[Nakamura, Emi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Fed Commun Commiss, Fed Reserve Board, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Nakamura, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Sun, Patrick/0009-0005-6003-3538","National Science Foundation [SES-0922011, SES-1056107]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Daniel Ginsberg, John Greenlees, Michael Horrigan, Robert McClelland, John Molino, Ted To, and numerous others at the Bureau of Labor Statistics for their help in the decade-long project of constructing the data set used in this article.

By randomly assigning employees to different varieties of a salary-linked savings account, we find that default enrollment increases participation by 40 percentage points-an effect equivalent to providing a 50 percent matching incentive. We then use a series of experimental interventions to differentiate between explanations for the default effect, which we conclude is driven largely by present-biased preferences and the cognitive cost of thinking through different savings scenarios. Default assignment also changes employees' attitudes toward saving, and makes them more likely to actively decide to save after the study concludes.","[Blumenstock, Joshua] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, 102 South Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Callen, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, Wells Fargo Hall,4W104,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ghani, Tarek] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, Snow Way,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Washington University (WUSTL),"Blumenstock, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, 102 South Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jblumenstock@berkeley.edu; mjcallen@ucsd.edu; tghani@wustl.edu,"Callen, Michael/JUU-7936-2023; Blumenstock, Joshua/ADN-3685-2022","Blumenstock, Joshua/0000-0002-1813-7414","Citi/IPA Financial Capability Research Fund (FCRF); Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty (CFSP); Empirical Studies of Conflict Project (ESOC); Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion (IMTFI); UC San Diego Policy Design and Evaluation Lab (PDEL); USAID Development Impact Lab (USAID) [AID-OAA-A-13-00002]; US Department of Defense Minerva research initiative through the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-09-1-000001]","Citi/IPA Financial Capability Research Fund (FCRF); Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty (CFSP); Empirical Studies of Conflict Project (ESOC); Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion (IMTFI); UC San Diego Policy Design and Evaluation Lab (PDEL); USAID Development Impact Lab (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); US Department of Defense Minerva research initiative through the Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of Defense)","Blumenstock: School of Information, University of California at Berkeley, 102 South Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 (email: jblumenstock@berkeley.edu); Callen: Rady School of Management, University of California at San Diego, Wells Fargo Hall, 4W104, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093 (email: mjcallen@ucsd.edu); Ghani: Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, Snow Way, 1 Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130 (email: tghani@wustl.edu).

We measure media bias based on coverage of government mouthpiece content (propaganda) relative to commercial content. We first find that a reform that forced newspaper exits (reduced competition) affected media bias by increasing product specialization, with some papers focusing on propaganda and others on commercial content. Second, lower-level governments produce less-biased content and launch commercial newspapers earlier, eroding higher-level governments' political goals. Third, bottom-up competition intensifies the politico-economic trade-off, leading to product proliferation and less audience exposure to propaganda.","[Qin, Bei] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Stromberg, David] Stockholm Univ, Econ Dept, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wu, Yanhui] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Hong Kong; Stockholm University; University of Southern California,"Qin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",beiqin@hku.hk; david.stromberg@iies.su.se; yanhuiwu@marshall.usc.edu,"Qin, Bei/IYJ-6713-2023","Qin, Bei/0000-0002-9069-0716; Wu, Yanhui/0000-0001-5832-6175",,,,,55,83,99,13,156,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

One common approach is to emphasize a credible research design; we review results from two randomized experiments, as well as some quasi-experimental studies. This work has produced compelling evidence that moral hazard in health insurance exists-that is, individuals, on average, consume less healthcare when they are required to pay more for it out of pocket-as well as qualitative evidence about its nature. These studies alone, however, provide little guidance for forecasting healthcare spending under contracts not directly observed in the data. Therefore, a second and complementary approach is to develop an economic model that can be used out of sample. We note that modeling choices can be consequential: different economic models may fit the reduced form but deliver different counterfactual predictions. An additional role of the more descriptive analyses is therefore to provide guidance regarding model choice.

Estimates reveal that a one percentage point increase in the share of migrants decreases income by 0.97% and reduces employment by 0.24 percentage points. These effects are different across sectors: employment reductions are concentrated in the formal sector, while income reduction occurs in the informal sector. Negative consequences are most pronounced for low-skilled natives, even though migrants are systematically highly skilled.

We use quarterly data which covers 1998:1 and 2015:1. Our analysis is based on 15 art price indices: Contemporary, Drawings, France, Global index (Euro), Global index (USD), Modern art, Nineteenth century, Old Masters, Paintings, Photographies, Postwar, Prints, Sculptures, UK and US. We find evidence of structural shifts and nonlinearity in the art indices. We cannot reject the null of unit root and/or stationarity in the art series based on the conventional linear unit root tests and quantile-based test that did not account for structural breaks. However, when we use the same methods but accounting for sharp shifts and smooth breaks, we are able to reject the unit root null for each of the art indices. Further we find evidence of asymmetric behaviour in some of the indices: two global indices, Paintings, Prints, Sculptures, Modern art and Postwar, where unit root exist at some quantiles but not at others. Overall, our result suggest that the art market is inefficient.

In contrast with previous research, we focus on the out-of-sample predictive power of oil price volatility rather than on in-sample inference. Formal tests of out-of-sample predictive ability find no evidence supporting the use of oil price volatility as a predictor of future stock return volatility. Further analysis using rolling window estimation and structural break tests shows that the coefficients of this relationship are very unstable.

A worker's skills follow a Gaussian process with an endogenous component reflecting human-capital accumulation. Effort and skills are substitutes both in the output process (as in Holmstrom 1999) and in the skills technology. The focus is on deterministic equilibria by virtue of Gaussian learning. When effort and skills are direct inputs to production and skills are exogenous, effort can be inefficiently high in the beginning of a career. In contrast, when skills are the only input to production but accumulate through past effort choices, the worker always underinvests in skill acquisition. At the center of the discrepancy are two types of ex post errors that arise at interpreting output due to an identification problem faced by the market. Finally, the robustness of the underinvestment result is explored via variations in the skill-accumulation technology and in the information structure, and policy implications are discussed.","[Cisternas, Ionlalo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Cisternas, I (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",gcistern@mit.edu,,,,,,,39,14,15,1,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

We develop a principal-agent model with reference-dependent utility that illustrates how labor contracts combining weak monetary incentives and wage-irrelevant goals can be optimal.

Catholicism is strongly pro-child (increasing total spending on children), followed by Buddhism, whereas Islam is more pro-birth (redirecting spending from quality to quantity).

We find that sukuk and conventional investment-grade bonds have a lower reaction of conditional volatility to market shocks and higher persistence; we also find that sukuk returns are much less volatile than U.S. and EU investment-grade bonds. Further, we find a time-varying, positive, conditional correlation between sukuk returns and leading bond markets, which is driven by changing macroeconomic and market conditions. We observe that during recessions, the dynamic correlation between sukuk and bond markets tends to increase. Moreover, we unveil structural breakpoints in paths of dynamic correlations corresponding to external shocks, such as the sovereign debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's tapering announcements. Finally, we examine how market-wide factors affect correlations. We find significant behavioral shifts in the sukuk-bonds relationship, which are explained by market liquidity, crude oil prices, U.S. credit information, and stock market uncertainty. Our results have useful implications for sukuk issuers, portfolio managers, and risk managers in both emerging and developed markets. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

But methodological and data concerns have thus far raised doubts about whether EPU contains marginal and exogenous information about other economic phenomena. Our work analyzes the impact on EPU of several possibly endogenous variables, such as inflation and unemployment rates in western countries where EPU is measured. We also consider longer-term technological factors, such as media fragmentation, which, by undermining political consensus, may indirectly elevate EPU. We find that about 40 percent of EPU movements can be explained by long and short-run movements in these determinants, which is consistent with limited evidence that de-trended movements in EPU may contain marginal information about GDP growth and other macro variables.

We provide a complete characterization of the general K-fund separation. We show that some instances of separation with many funds can be constructed by adding inverse marginal utility functions having separation with one or a few funds. We also show that there is money separation (in which we can choose the riskless asset as one of the funds) if and only if there is a fund (which may or may not be the riskless asset) with a constant allocation as wealth changes. In general, we do not know how to write the separating utility functions in closed form, but we can do so in the special case of SAHARA utility defined by Chen et al. and for a new class of GOBI preferences introduced here.

In a field experiment in rural Malawi, we hired casual day laborers at piece rates and collected detailed data on the quantity and quality of their output. Specifically, we use a simplified Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, which provides random variation in piece rates conditional on revealed reservation rates, to separately identify the effects of worker selection and incentives on output. We find a positive relationship between output quantity and the piece rate, and show that this is solely the result of the incentive effect, not selection. In addition, we randomized whether workers were subject to stringent quality monitoring. Monitoring led to higher quality output, at some cost to the quantity produced. However, workers do not demand higher compensation when monitored, and monitoring has no measurable effect on the quality of workers willing to work under a given piece rate. Together, the set of worker responses that we document lead the employer to prefer a contract that offers little surplus to the worker, consistent with an equilibrium in which workers have little bargaining power.","[Guiteras, Raymond P.] North Carolina State Univ, 4326 Nelson Hall,Campus Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Jack, B.

We hypothesize that fiscal competition to attract firms results in lower business tax revenues and higher public infrastructure spending which crowds out education and health spending leading to an increase in obesity rates. We empirically test this hypothesis. We find that there is significant fiscal competition to attract firms. Next, we show that when business tax revenues are lowered and public infrastructure spending favouring businesses increased, public health and education spending declines and obesity rates significantly increase. Thus, fiscal competition significantly contributes to obesity rates through the education and health spending channel.","[Galinato, Gregmar I.; Zhou, You] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Galinato, GI (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",ggalinato@wsu.edu,,"Zhou, You/0000-0002-1687-4365",,,,,44,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The assignation formula used until 2013, distributed the Fund according to the relative poverty of each state in relation to the national poverty. This design did not generate the appropriate incentives to reduce poverty. Methods: Based on a principal agent model, and explicitly acknowledging the informational asymmetry between the federal and sub national levels of government, in this paper we propose a formula to assign the Fund, which has two fundamental characteristics: the FATS is distributed using the relative poverty of states / municipalities; and includes a component to avoid the perverse incentive of the formula used until 2013. Results: A mechanism is designed and used as the theoretical basis to construct a formula to assign the transfer. Conclusions: In order to achieve the proposed impact of the governmental programs financed with federal transfers, it is important to design and implement the mechanisms to align the incentives of the different governmental levels.","[Ibarra Salazar, Jorge] Escuela Ciencias Sociales & Gobierno Tecnol Monte, Dept Econ, Monterrey, Mexico; [Ibarra Salazar, Jorge] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Southern Methodist University,"Salazar, JI (通讯作者)，Escuela Ciencias Sociales & Gobierno Tecnol Monte, Dept Econ, Monterrey, Mexico.;Salazar, JI (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",jaibarra@itesm.mx,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,8,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In this article, we are the first to examine the evolution of the implicit costs of motherhood over the lifecycle and across generations using high quality administrative data. We estimate that the lifetime labor market income gap between mothers and women who never have children (never-mothers) decreases from around $350,000 to $280,000 between women born in the late 1940s and late 1960s. Gaps tend to increase monotonically over the lifecycle, and decrease monotonically between cohorts.

Hence, a universal childcare system with easy access has the potential to make a substantial difference in children's lives and reduce socio-economic disparities in educational outcomes. However, if childcare quality varies across centers, universal childcare systems can also potentially increase disparities in school readiness if the children of more highly-educated parents select into centers of higher quality. Using a unique dataset with one-to-one assessments of school readiness skills among 627 five-year-olds attending 67 different childcare centers, we investigate differences in childcare quality by testing whether covariate adjusted assessments scores are clustered by center. Through fixed effect and random effect analyses, we demonstrate significant variation in school readiness across centers. However, selection into centers of different quality appears to be limited.","[Rege, Mari; Solli, Ingeborg Foldoy; Storksen, Ingunn] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Votruba, Mark] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Solli, IF (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway.",mari.rege@uis.no; ingeborg.f.solli@uis.no; ingunn.storksen@uis.no; mxv27@case.edu,"Votruba, Mark Edward/KAM-6544-2024","Votruba, Mark Edward/0000-0002-4870-3376; Rege, Mari/0000-0002-9574-5851; Solli, Ingeborg Foldoy/0000-0002-9016-9920",Aust-Agder utviklings-og kompetansefond; Sorlandet Knowledge Foundation; Aust-Agder county administration; Norwegian Research Council [237973]; Vest-Agder county administration,Aust-Agder utviklings-og kompetansefond; Sorlandet Knowledge Foundation; Aust-Agder county administration; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Vest-Agder county administration,"Financial support from Aust-Agder utviklings-og kompetansefond, the Sorlandet Knowledge Foundation, Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder county administrations, and the Norwegian Research Council [237973] is gratefully acknowledged.",,61,16,17,3,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55,,,,,,230,240,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.10.003,0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000454465000013,0

We consider a three-player sequential game in which the first and third players do not interact sequentially, but only through an intermediary, the second player. We posit that the third player's decision to cooperate depends on his indirect higher order belief, namely, his belief about what the first player believes the second player would choose. We employ pre-play communication between the first and third players as a way to influence the third player's indirect higher order belief. The evidence demonstrates that communication can effectively induce cooperation from the third player by shaping his indirect higher order belief.","[Wu, Jiabin] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 515 PLC 1285, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Wu, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 515 PLC 1285, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",jwu5@uoregon.edu,,"WU, JIABIN/0000-0001-6515-9678",,,,,39,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and applying a difference-in-difference design we find that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do not find evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Additional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main findings, but also highlight the importance of country specific circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.

This decreases the organizational complexity of allowing more flexible payment terms for customers. We test whether subsidies, deposit requirements, and access to a mobile money savings vehicle increase the propensity of households to purchase an improved but more expensive sanitation service. While high subsidies increase purchases of the improved service, interventions inspired by mental accounting such as deposit requirements and earmarked savings accounts do not. The option to save in earmarked accounts using mobile money caused households to substitute away from purchasing the improved service in the general market and towards purchasing it through our providers, rather than substituting away from the unimproved service. We discuss implications for mental accounting-based policies compared to more traditional subsidies.","[Lipscomb, Molly] UVA, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Schechter, Laura] UW Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Virginia; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Schechter, L (通讯作者)，UW Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lschechter@wisc.edu,,,,,,,36,14,16,1,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

First, I show suggestive evidence that women with a first-born girl have lower survival. Second, consistent with prior literature, I find that having a first-born girl leads to fertility behaviors medically known to hurt women's survival. Third, I show new evidence of effects of a first-born girl on a mother's likelihood and severity of anemia. These outcomes are severely aggravated with each successive female birth. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that these channels can explain over a quarter of the missing mothers with first-born girls. The paper does not find evidence of discrimination in the allocation of food or receipt of iron supplements, however, severe physical domestic violence increases significantly soon after the birth of a first daughter.","[Milazzo, Annamaria] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Milazzo, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",amilazzo14@gmail.com,"Milazzo, Annamaria/C-5620-2019","Milazzo, Annamaria/0000-0003-0176-9439",,,,,81,23,25,1,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Thus, an ex post competition policy approach would be preferable to a strict ex ante prohibition of NN violations. In contrast, the current paper argues that NN regulation is largely ineffective, in particular, when it comes to the prohibition of fast lanes and other quality of service (QoS) differentiations, and to a lesser extent, when it comes to the zero price rule. NN regulation is only effective in preventing the blocking of specific content and in preventing the favoring of ISP owned content and in preventing some price discriminations. These are also areas where NN regulations are more likely to be welfare-enhancing. Where they are ineffective, NN regulations are likely to create inefficiencies through the cost and allocative inefficiencies caused by NN bypass. The paper ends with a call for theoretical and empirical economic analyses of NN circumvention techniques.","[Vogelsang, Ingo] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Vogelsang, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",vogelsan@bu.edu,,,,,,,30,2,2,1,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

While we find short-run asymmetric effects of volatility in almost all industries, we find evidence of adjustment asymmetry in 17 exporting and nine importing industries. We also find significant impact or short-run cumulative asymmetry in 12 exporting and six importing industries. The most important finding is significant long-run asymmetric effects in 36 Malaysian exporting industries and 25 Malaysian importing industries.

EVIDENCE FROM THE WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SAVINGS; DEMAND; COST; US,"A growing number of policies and programs aim to increase investment in energy efficiency, because conventional wisdom suggests that people fail to take up these investments even though they have positive private returns and generate environmental benefits. Many explanations for this energy efficiency gap have been put forward, but there has been surprisingly little field testing of whether the conventional wisdom is correct. This article reports on the results of an experimental evaluation of the nation's largest residential energy efficiency program-the Weatherization Assistance Program-conducted on a sample of approximately 30,000 households in Michigan. The findings suggest that the upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. Furthermore, the model-projected savings are more than three times the actual savings. Although this might be attributed to the rebound effect-when demand for energy end uses increases as a result of greater efficiency-the article fails to find evidence of significantly higher indoor temperatures at weatherized homes. Even when accounting for the broader societal benefits derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the benefits; the average rate of return is approximately -7.8% annually.","[Fowlie, Meredith] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fowlie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Alfred P.

The results from cointegration and error correction modeling show that exports and imports have statistically significant impacts of opposite signs on Consumption-based CO2 emissions in both the long- and short-run and that the effects of changes in the trade-CO2 emissions relationship will fully be absorbed around three years. However, exports and imports are statistically insignificant for Territory-based CO2 emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Governments often react by intervening against currency depreciation as, for example, in the case of Papua New Guinea in response to the commodity price shocks of 2014. We develop an original theoretical model to analyze the balance of payments impact of a commodity price shock under alternative exchange rate regimes: a flexible rate regime and a fixed rate regime with foreign exchange rationing. The balance of payments consequences are shown to depend on the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to the exchange rate. For the Papua New Guinea case, we estimate export elasticities for a variety of commodities (gold, silver, copper, oil, coffee, cocoa, copra, copra oil, palm oil, rubber, tea, logs, and marine products) as well as for imports. The results indicate that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied for this resource-rich economy, implying that exchange rate flexibility may be practicable. We implement our calibrated model to conduct a counter-factual simulation and find that with a flexible exchange rate, foreign reserves would have been 20 percent higher three years after the shock than they were under the actual policy of exchange rate stabilization. In light of this, we argue the merits of greater exchange rate flexibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Simulations of labor-market adjustments caused by a trade-related fall in manufacturing goods prices indicate that the share of informally employed workers rises after liberalization, but this is due to entry into the labor market by previously idle labor, a mechanism that has been seldom analyzed in the existing literature.","[Arias, Javier] Secretaria Hacienda & Credito Publ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Artuc, Erhan; Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Rojas, Diego] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",The World Bank; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Artuc, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",micho.arias@gmail.com; eartuc@worldbank.org; dlederman@worldbank.org; rojas.luisdiego@gmail.com,,"Artuc, Erhan/0000-0001-9055-7934",World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; World Bank International Trade Department's (PRMTR) program on Trade and Labor; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; World Bank International Trade Department's (PRMTR) program on Trade and Labor; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,"The authors gratefully acknowledge insights from conversations with Mourad Bentahar, Mona Haddad, John McLaren, William F.

DSGE models with rare disasters require solution methods that can handle the large nonlinearities triggered by low-probability, high-impact events with accuracy and speed. We solve a standard New Keynesian model with Epstein-Zin preferences and time-varying disaster risk with perturbation, Taylor projection, and Smolyak collocation. Our main finding is that Taylor projection delivers the best accuracy/speed tradeoff among the tested solutions. We also document that even third-order perturbations may generate solutions that suffer from accuracy problems and that Smolyak collocation can be costly in terms of run time and memory requirements.","[Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Levintal, Oren] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Tiomkin Sch Econ, Herzliyya, Israel",University of Pennsylvania; Reichman University,"Fernández-Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jesusfv@econ.upenn.edu; oren.levintal@idc.ac.il,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1223271],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Marlene Isore, Pablo Winant, Xavier Gabaix, Tony Smith, the editor Karl Smedders, four referees, and participants at several seminars for comments.

We derive the fine schedule and detection level that are constrained-optimal under legal principles and sustainability of cartel prices. This fine schedule lies below the maximum fine, makes collusion on lower prices more attractive than on higher prices, and, hence, relates to the body of literature on marginal deterrence.","[Houba, Harold; Motchenkova, Evgenia] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wen, Quan] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Houba, H (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",harold.houba@vu.nl; e.i.motchenkova@vu.nl; wenq2@uw.edu,,"Motchenkova, Evgenia/0000-0003-2535-4350; Houba, Harold/0000-0001-9085-7339",,,,,48,7,8,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Debate assumes one of two genres, depending on bias: Ajuror, say Lones, is intransigent if he wishes to prevail and reach a conviction for any type of Moritz next to concede. In contrast, Lones is ambivalent if he wants the strongest conceding types of Moritz to push for acquittal. Both jurors are ambivalent with small bias or high delay costs. As Lones grows more hawkish, he argues more forcefully for convictions, mitigating wrongful acquittals. If dovish Moritz is intransigent, then he softens (strategic substitutes), leading to more wrongful convictions. Ambivalent debate is new, and yields a novel dynamic benefit of increased polarization. For if Moritz is ambivalent, then he toughens (strategic complements), and so, surprisingly, a more hawkish Lones leads to fewer wrongful acquittals and convictions. So more polarized but balanced debate can improve communication, unlike in static cheap talk. We also show that patient and not too biased jurors vote against their posteriors near the end of the debate, optimally playing devil's advocate. We shed light on the adversarial legal system, peremptory challenges, and cloture rules.","[Meyer-Ter-Vehn, Moritz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Meyer-Ter-Vehn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,"SMITH, LONES/AAF-5793-2020","Bognar, Katalin/0000-0001-8357-8569",,,,,33,2,2,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

I first review some of the conceptual and empirical challenges faced when trying to accommodate this notion in micro-founded, general-equilibrium models. I next review my own research, which sheds new light on the observed business cycles by accommodating frictional coordination in the form of higher-order uncertainty. This makes room for forces akin to animal spirits even when the equilibrium is unique. It allows demand shocks to generate realistic business cycles even when nominal rigidity is absent or undone by appropriate monetary policy. It modifies the general-equilibrium predictions of workhorse macroeconomic models in manners that seem both conceptually appealing and empirically relevant.

Identification relies on three levels of randomization. We find an average 0.17 standard deviation improvement in math scores among primary school students. This average effect is the same for students treated individually or in pairs, implying that peer effects double the learning benefit from a given equipment. Among paired students, poor performers benefit more from CAL when paired with good performers and vice versa. Average performers benefit equally irrespective of who they are paired with. This suggests that the treatment is dominated by knowledge exchange between peers.

This is because child care has a positive income gradient, whereas leisure and housework do not. Using U.S. data from PSID-CDS, this paper computes parental child care during and outside of typical work hours (TWH) by income quintile for two-parent families. The TWH distinction is important because the opportunity cost of spending time with children is first and foremost in terms of forgone earnings during TWH; outside of TWH, leisure or housework mainly constitute this opportunity cost. Indeed, I find that child care decreases with income during TWH and, hence, behaves similarly to leisure and other household chores. While maternal child care also slightly decreases with income outside of TWH, paternal care increases with income outside of TWH. Also, the discrepancy between paternal and maternal child care is smaller outside of TWH than it is during TWH. This is particularly pronounced in high income families. Theoretical implications are derived in a static framework of time allocation and child quality production encompassing the recent literature on the topic. Variation in child care during TWH can be rationalized by assuming a high elasticity of substitution between leisure, consumption and child quality. This is the standard explanation for the patterns observed in leisure and housework. Within this widely used framework, however, the facts outside of TWH point to systematic differences by income in preferences or productivity. Further exploration of child care patterns during and outside of TWH is needed to inform us about the dimensions in which this widely used framework should be extended.","[Schoonbroodt, Alice] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Pappajohn Business Bldg,W334, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Schoonbroodt, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Pappajohn Business Bldg,W334, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",alice-schoonbroodt@uiowa.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,26,18,20,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Profitability rises with age for young firms, remains elevated, and then declines slowly for mature firms. A dynamic lifecycle model captures the observed age profile of profitability. Investment in product development generates profitability increases for young firms while wage pressures from more productive entrants lead to profitability declines for mature firms. The model generates the lifecycle behavior of financing and growth documented in the literature, even though it contains no financial frictions. It also implies greater sensitivity of financing and growth to age for young firms, a prediction supported by empirical tests.

The model's intuitively sensible equilibrium outcomes differ qualitatively from those in other models of these negotiations. I demonstrate one application of the model that provides empirical predictions about how the choice of transacting via negotiations or auctions is affected by factors including the number of trading partners, uncertainty when making the choice, and costly participation in the trading process. More generally the model provides a tractable foundation for analyzing strategic problems in settings featuring multilateral negotiations, including investment, product design, mergers, and hold-up.

Members of the creative class possess creative capital and they fall into one of two possible groups they are either artists or engineers. We describe the optimal income redistribution rule that maximizes the creative class's average steady state income. Because this average income is increasing in the physical capital per creative class member ratio, the rule requires a regional authority to redistribute income away from (towards) the group that saves a lower (higher) fraction of its income. This is a negative finding in the sense that the rule's implementation will tend to favor the group that already saves more. Even so, the finding is consistent with the observation made by some researchers that there is a connection between income inequality and regions in which the creative class performs a large part of all economic activities.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Batabyal, AA (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",aabgsh@rit.edu; Hamid.Beladi@utsa.edu,,"Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519",Gosnell endowment at RUT,Gosnell endowment at RUT,"We thank the Editor Sushanta Mallick and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments on a previous version of this paper.

Demand shocks affect the price for up to 15 years, whereas the effect of mineral supply shocks persists for up to 5 years.

In this study, we robustly observe this behavior (called chaotic itinerancy) in a model of multi-regional business cycles, in which all regions of a national economy are homogeneous and connected through producers' behavior based on the average level announced by the government. Although a producer very slowly adjusts his/her output towards the average level, regional business cycles begin to synchronize because of the entrainment effect. Moreover, when a producer emphasizes the profit maximization more and when puts more weight on the average level in his/her decision-making, the economy is more likely to exhibit such intermittent transition. Further, it is clarified that behind intermittent transition exist cycles among periodic orbits with different number of unstable directions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2002, which exclusively contains information about the lineage structure in these villages allowing us to classify three levels of lineage-based heterogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneity of lineage-based heterogeneity. We find evidence that people in a village with higher lineage-based heterogeneity are less likely to exhibit reciprocity behavior within lineages or contribute to the provision of public goods that are jointly shared across lineages. The estimation results remain robust to the inclusion of various control variables and additional background characteristics. Finally, we examine a number of other economic outcomes and find that more homogenous villages do better than other types of villages.","[He, Quqiong] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China; [He, Quqiong] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Econometr Anal & Forecasting, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Sarangi, Sudipta] Virginia Tech, 3016 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Sarangi, Sudipta] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae); Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Sarangi, S (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, 3016 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",quqiong.he@gmail.com; Ying_Pan@fanniemae.com; ssarangi@vt.edu,,,"Liaoning Provincial Department of Education [LN2016JD004]; Social Science Fund [15ZDA011]; National Science Foundation of China [71571033, 71603042]; Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics",Liaoning Provincial Department of Education; Social Science Fund; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics,"Quqiong He would like to acknowledge financial support from Liaoning Provincial Department of Education (No. LN2016JD004), Social Science Fund (No. 15ZDA011), the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71571033 and 71603042), and the Academic Development Fund from the school of economics of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics.",,60,13,14,3,26,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

In this paper a novel formal modeling approach is conceptually developed and presented to address sustainable supplier selection. Grey theory and TOPSIS, a distance based multiple criteria method, are used for the integration and evaluation of sustainable supplier performance for sustainable supplier selection. From a research perspective, TOPSIS is improved to more effectively deal with grey numbers by integrating a degree of likelihood rather than converting grey numbers into crisp numbers functions, and it provides more flexible supplier rankings. This methodology strengthens the sustainable supplier selection process, and can be applied to other multiple criteria decision making problems. Illustrative calculations are made using data on sustainable supplier selection and evaluation published by Bai and Sarkis (2010). The technique is relatively accurate, matching well with results from a published grey rough set approach. The methodology easily implementable with minimal complex calculations required. It can also provide support for sustainable supplier selection, benchmarking, and improvement decisions. This is one of the first papers to integrate a broad set of sustainability factors for grey-based TOPSIS and supplier selection.","[Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Bai, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hitech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,"Bai, Chunguang April/E-3296-2012; Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014","Bai, Chunguang April/0000-0002-9461-1632; Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X","National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71772032).",,33,29,31,12,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This change in life expectancy has potentially profound influences on life-cycle decisions. A longer life expectancy increases the value of human capital investment, while the effect on savings is theoretically ambiguous and life-cycle saving could increase or decrease. This paper uses spatial and temporal variation in ART availability to evaluate the impact of ART provision on savings and investment. We find that ART availability significantly increases savings, expenditures on education, and children's schooling, including among HIV-negative individuals who do not directly benefit from ART. These results are not driven by the direct health effects of treatment or reductions in caretaking responsibilities, but rather by reduced perceptions of mortality risk after ART has become available.","[Baranov, Victoria] Univ Melbourne, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Melbourne; University of Pennsylvania,"Kohler, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",victoria.baranov@unimelb.edu.au; hpkohler@pop.upenn.edu,,"Kohler, Hans-Peter/0000-0003-0639-4349; Baranov, Victoria/0000-0003-4777-6466","Beinecke Scholarship; National Science Foundation GRFP; National Institute of Child Health and Development at the University of Pennsylvania [R03HD058976, R21HD050652, R21HD071471, R21AG053763, R01HD044228, R01HD053781, R01HD087391]; National Institute on Aging at the University of Pennsylvania [P30 AG12836]; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program at the University of Pennsylvania [R24 HD-044964]",Beinecke Scholarship; National Science Foundation GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Child Health and Development at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute on Aging at the University of Pennsylvania; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program at the University of Pennsylvania,"We would like to thank anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

To improve treatment outcomes, it is important to identify risk factors for insomnia and sedative-hypnotic use. Classification and regression trees and logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with insomnia or sedative-hypnotic use. Key findings include low insomnia diagnosis rates (3.5-5.6%) and high rates of sedative-hypnotics (44.2-49.0%). Younger Veterans and those without a breathing-related sleep disorder (BRSD) were more likely to receive an insomnia diagnosis. Veterans with greater service connection and those with an alcohol/substance use disorder were more likely to be prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Interaction terms may have identified potential groups at risk of being under-diagnosed with insomnia (i.e. non-black Veterans with psychiatric co-morbidity, black Veterans without psychiatric co-morbidity) as well as groups at risk for sedative-hypnotic use (i.e. younger Veterans without BRSD). In sum, Veterans with PTSD have high rates of sedative-hypnotic use despite minimal evidence they are effective. This is counter to recommendations indicating behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment. Policy changes are needed to reduce use of sedative-hypnotics and increase access to behavioral insomnia interventions.","[Bramoweth, Adam D.; Luther, James; Hanusa, Barbara H.; Walker, Jon D.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Bramoweth, Adam D.; Atwood, Charles W., Jr.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Luther, James] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Atwood, Charles W., Jr.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Germain, Anne] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Bramoweth, AD (通讯作者)，VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Bramoweth, AD (通讯作者)，VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",Adam.Bramoweth@va.gov,"Bramoweth, Adam/ABB-6789-2020","Bramoweth, Adam/0000-0002-3535-0292","Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center [XVA 72-904]; HSR&D Career Development Award [CDA 13-260]","Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center; HSR&D Career Development Award","This work was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 4 Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center [XVA 72-904] and a HSR&D Career Development Award [CDA 13-260].",,47,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The primitives are the preferences of the players, their assignment to nonoverlapping groups, and the goals of the groups. Our notion of collusion is that a group coordinates the play of its members among different incentive compatible plans to best achieve its goals. Unfortunately, equilibria that meet this requirement need not exist. We instead introduce the weaker notion of collusion constrained equilibrium. This allows groups to put positive probability on alternatives that are suboptimal for the group in certain razor's edge cases where the set of incentive compatible plans changes discontinuously. These collusion constrained equilibria exist and are a subset of the correlated equilibria of the underlying game. We examine four perturbations of the underlying game. In each case,we show that equilibria in which groups choose the best alternative exist and that limits of these equilibria lead to collusion constrained equilibria. We also show that for a sufficiently broad class of perturbations, every collusion constrained equilibrium arises as such a limit. We give an application to a voter participation game that shows how collusion constraints may be socially costly.","[Dutta, Rohan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Levine, David K.] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Modica, Salvatore] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ, Palermo, Italy",McGill University; European University Institute; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Palermo,"Dutta, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",rohan.dutta@mcgill.ca; david@dklein.com; salvatore.modica@unipa.it,,,EIEF; MIUR PRIN [20103S5RN3],"EIEF; MIUR PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We are especially grateful to Marco Mariotti, Andrea Mattozzi, Kirill Pogorelskiy, Joel Sobel, Chris Tyson, seminar participants at Bocconi, Glasgow, Naples, Padua, QMUL, the Games Meetings in Maastricht, and a number of anonymous referees.

We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications.","[Glaeser, Edward] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gyourko, Joseph] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Real Estate Finance & Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Harvard University; University of Pennsylvania,"Glaeser, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu; gyourko@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University; Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School,Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University; Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School,"Edward Glaeser thanks the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University for financial support.

Numerous studies analyse the productivity effects of financial development and frictions. The results suggest the following: (1) Financial development likely has favourable effects on productivity growth, (2) financial frictions that impede the efficient flow of finance can mitigate the positive effects through a variety of channels and (3) the magnitudes of productivity costs of financial frictions generally appear modest in financially developed economies but are considerably larger in developing economies. The paper also reviews studies of the influence of specific mechanisms on productivity, such as human capital, corporate finance, financial sector efficiency, equity finance and venture capital. Some policies that hamper productivity growth include inefficient insolvency regimes that impede exit of low-productivity firms, poorly developed contract monitoring and enforcement systems between banks and firms, collateral constraints that impair resource reallocation and imperfect bank supervisory practices that diminish productive capital reallocation through distorted lending practices.","[Heil, Mark] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20220 USA",United States Department of the Treasury,"Heil, M (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20220 USA.",mark.heil@treasury.gov,,,,,,,79,16,16,2,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper demonstrates how to formulate the inference problem for sign-restricted SVARs within a moment-inequality framework. In particular, it develops methods of constructing confidence bands for impulse response functions of sign-restricted SVARs that are valid from a frequentist perspective.

In a theoretical framework, we model overleveraging and demonstrate how a highly leveraged banking system can lead to unstable dynamics and downward spirals. Inspired by models developed by Brunnermeier, Sannikov and Stein, we empirically measure the deviation-from-optimal-leverage for a sample of large EU banks. This measure of overleveraging is used to condition the joint dynamics of credit flows and macroeconomic activity in a large-scale regime change model: a Threshold Mixed-Cross-Section Global Vector Autoregressive (T-MCS-GVAR). The regime-switching component of the model is meant to make the relationship between credit and real activity dependent on the extent to which the banking system is overleveraged. We find significant nonlinearities as a function of overleverage. The farther the observed leverage in the banking system from optimal leverage, the more detrimental is the effect of a deleveraging shock on credit supply and economic activity.","[Gross, Marco; Henry, Jerome] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Semmler, Willi] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany",European Central Bank; The New School; University of Bielefeld,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Gross, Marco/0000-0003-2097-6740; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,32,10,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Using data on Connecticut's Jobs First experiment, we find no evidence of behavioral-induced participation at the highest conditional quantiles of earnings. We offer a simple explanation for this: women assigned to Jobs First incur welfare participation costs to labor supply at higher earnings where the control group is welfare ineligible. Moreover, as expected, behavioral components and costs of program participation do not seem to play a differential role at other conditional quantiles where both groups are eligible to participate. Our findings show that a welfare program imposes an estimated cost up to 10 percent of quarterly earnings, and these costs can be heterogeneous throughout the conditional earnings distribution. The evidence is obtained by employing a semi-parametric panel quantile estimator for a model that allows women to vary arbitrarily in costs of participating in welfare programs.","[Hartley, Robert Paul] Columbia Univ, Ctr Poverty & Social Policy, 1255 Amsterdam Ave,Room 730, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lamarche, Carlos] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223G, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",Columbia University; University of Kentucky,"Lamarche, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223G, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",rh2845@columbia.edu; clamarche@uky.edu,"Hartley, Robert/ABD-5314-2020","Hartley, Robert Paul/0000-0002-5640-9169",,,,,53,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54,,,,,,135,151,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.002,0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000447577200009,0

First, the variation in log real hourly wages is decomposed into three components reflecting worker, firm, and job title characteristics and a residual element. It is found that worker permanent heterogeneity is the most important source of wage variation accounting for one third of the wage variance, while firm permanent effects contribute one fourth. Job title fixed effects still explain a considerable one fifth of wage variance. Second, having established that high-wage workers tend to match with high-paying firms, worker fixed effects from the wage equation are next correlated with firm fixed effects from sales and value-added production equations to provide unambiguous evidence on the sign and strength of assortative matching. The correlations are positive and large, indicating that higher productivity workers tend to match with higher productivity firms.","[Torres, Sonia] Stat Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro; Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC USA; [Portugal, Pedro; Addison, John T.; Guimaraes, Paulo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Addison, John T.] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro] Nova SBE, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Durham University; Universidade do Porto; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal.",sonia.torres@ine.pt; pportugal@bportugal.pt; ecceaddi@moore.sc.edu; pfguimaraes@bportugal.pt,"Portugal, Pedro/M-7216-2019; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008","Portugal, Pedro/0000-0001-8298-6683; Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028",,,,,49,7,8,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54,,,,,,47,60,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.004,0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000447577200004,0

Subjects play a class of order statistic coordination games closely related to the well-known minimum (or weak-link) and median games (Van Huyck et al. in Am Econ Rev 80:234-248, 1990, Q J Econ 106(3):885-910, 1991). When subjects play a random sequence of games with differing order statistics, play is less sensitive to the order statistic than when a fixed order statistic is used throughout. This is consistent with the prediction of a simple learning model with transfer. If subjects play a series of similar stag hunt games, play converges to the payoff dominant equilibrium when a convention emerges, replicating the main result of Rankin et al. (Games Econ Behav 32:315-337, 2000). When these subjects subsequently play a random sequence of order statistic games, play is shifted towards the payoff dominant equilibrium relative to subjects without previous experience. The data is consistent with subjects absorbing a general principle, play of the payoff dominant equilibrium, and applying it in a new related setting.","[Cooper, David J.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Van Huyck, John] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",djcooper@fsu.edu,,,NSF [SES-0214310],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding was provided by the NSF (SES-0214310).

The structural parameters that determine firm scope explain variation in supply-chain length and gross-output-to-value-added ratios, and determine countries' comparative advantage along and across supply chains.

Little trust is evident beyond the relationships among Chinese and North Korean state-owned enterprises. Formal networks and dispute settlement mechanisms are weak and do not appear to have consequences for relational contracting. Rather, firms rely on personal ties for identifying counterparties and resolving disputes.

These mechanisms come in two forms, one based on subsidies/taxes, the other based on constraints/price caps. In spite of a number of improvements and a good empirical track record simple approaches so far remain imperfect. The current paper comes up with a new proposal, called H-R-G-V, which blends the two traditions and is shown in simulations to apply well to electricity transmission pricing and investment. In particular, it induces immediately optimal pricing/investment but is not based on subsidies. In the transmission application, the H-R-G-V approach is based on a bilevel optimization with the transmission company (Transco) at the top and the independent system operator (ISO) at the bottom level. We show that H-R-G-V, while not perfect, marks an improvement over the other simple mechanisms and a convergence of the two traditions. We suggest ways to deal with remaining practical issues of demand and cost functions changing over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Hesamzadeh, M.

We test whether past unemployment experience can explain this transition happiness gap in the context of Ukraine, a country with a painful delayed transition from planned to market economy. We analyze unique longitudinal data for the period 2003-2012. Current unemployment substantially reduces subjective wellbeing, and the effect is roughly 50% larger for men than for women. The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment. However, it does correspond to around 8% of the transition happiness gap found by Guriev and Melnikov (2017), suggesting that past unemployment experience can be considered as a partial explanation.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nizalova, Olena] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Nizalova, Olena] IZA, London, England; [Nizalova, Olena] GLO, Torquay, England; [Murtazashvili, Irina] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Kent; Drexel University,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; Nizalova, Olena/K-2319-2019; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [649496]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649496] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This project has been partially supported with funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 649496.,,20,4,4,1,7,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

One might ask why the traditional Keynes-Kalecki or structuralist (KKS) model would bear any relationship to the multi-agent modeling approach. This paper shows how KKS models might benefit from agent-based microfoundations, without sacrificing traditional macroeconomic themes, such as aggregate demand, animal spirits and endogenous money. Above all, the integration of the two approaches gives rise to the possibility that a KKS systemstable over many consecutive time periodsmight lurch into an uncontrollable downturn, from which a recovery would require outside intervention. As a by-product of the integration of these two popular approaches, there emerges a cogent analysis of the network structure necessary to bind real and financial agents into an integrated whole. It is seen, contrary to much of the existing literature, that a highly connected financial system does not necessarily lead to more crashes of the integrated system.","[Gibson, Bill] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",University of Vermont; The New School,"Setterfield, M (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Econ Dept, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mark.setterfield@newschool.edu,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2018,69,3,,,,,566,592,,10.1111/meca.12201,0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0TN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000436803900003,0

Several authors have argued recently, however, that even if demand and growth are profit-led in many individual countries, the global economy is likely to be wage-led since the planet as a whole runs balanced trade. This paper shows that this argument, while intuitively appealing, does not hold up to careful examination. Although the world economy as a whole is a closed system, it is not isomorphic to a closed economy, thanks to repercussion effects, relative price movements, and cross-country heterogeneity. Using asymmetries in consumption as a simple illustrative device I show that, in a two-country world, the effects of global redistribution depend on the nature of the constituent economies. This conclusion holds in spite of balanced trade at a planetary level, and regardless of whether one or both economies have excess capacity or whether zero-sum effects are present or not.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Using a dynamic model of educational choice, we estimate returns to education that account for selection bias and sorting on gains. We investigate a range of nonmarket outcomes, including incarceration, mental health, voter participation, trust, and participation in welfare. We find distinct patterns of returns that depend on the levels of schooling and ability. Unlike the monetary benefits of education, the benefits to education for many nonmarket outcomes are greater for low-ability persons. College graduation decreases welfare use, lowers depression, and raises self-esteem more for less-able individuals.","[Heckman, James J.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Heckman, James J.] Amer Bar Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Humphries, John Eric] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Veramendi, Gregory] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Chicago; Yale University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Heckman, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Heckman, JJ (通讯作者)，Amer Bar Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",,,"Humphries, John Eric/0000-0002-5832-5540","American Bar Foundation; Pritzker Children's Initiative; Buffett Early Childhood Fund; National Institutes of Health [NICHD R37HD065072, NICHD R01HD054702]; Successful Pathways from School to Work, an initiative of the University of Chicago's Committee on Education - Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, an initiative of the Center for the Economics of Human Development; Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics; Institute for New Economic Thinking; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship","American Bar Foundation; Pritzker Children's Initiative; Buffett Early Childhood Fund; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Successful Pathways from School to Work, an initiative of the University of Chicago's Committee on Education - Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, an initiative of the Center for the Economics of Human Development; Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics; Institute for New Economic Thinking; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This paper was presented at the Becker Friedman Institute conference in honor of Gary Becker, Friday, October 16, 2015.

But how do firms incentivize quantity and quality to meet these dual goals, and what role do behavioral factors, such as loss aversion, play in the tradeoffs workers face? We address these questions with a theoretical model and an experiment in which participants are paid for both quantity and quality of a real effort task. Consistent with basic economic theory, higher quality incentives encourage participants to shift their attention from quantity to quality. However, we also find that loss averse participants shift their attention from quality to quantity to a greater degree when quality is weakly incentivized.

An event analysis of subsidy incidence,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ethanol; Subsidy; Tax credit; Policy; Incidence; Event study; Futures price,MARKET; POLICY,"At the end of 2011, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC), which had subsidized the blending of ethanol in gasoline, was allowed to expire. During its tenure, the subsidy was the subject of intense scrutiny concerning who benefited from its existence. Using commodity price data, we estimate the subsidy incidence accruing to corn farmers, ethanol producers, gasoline blenders, and gasoline consumers around the time of expiration. Our empirical approach contributes methodologically to the event studies literature by analyzing futures contract prices (as opposed to spot prices) when possible. Ultimately, we find compelling evidence that, at the date of VEETC expiration, ethanol producers captured about 254 of the 454 subsidy per gallon of ethanol blended. We find suggestive, albeit inconclusive, evidence that a portion of this benefit (about 50 per gallon) was passed further upstream from ethanol producers to corn farmers. Most of the remainder seems most likely to have been captured by the blenders themselves. On the petroleum side, we find no evidence that oil refiners captured any part of the subsidy. We also find no evidence that the subsidy was passed downstream to gasoline consumers in the form of lower gasoline prices.","[Bielen, David A.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Newell, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA; [Pizer, William A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Newell, Richard G.; Pizer, William A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Resources for the Future; Duke University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Newell, RG (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",david.bielen@nrel.gov; newell@rff.org; william.pizer@duke.edu,"; Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","pizer, william/0000-0003-1498-1148; Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562",Bipartisan Policy Center,Bipartisan Policy Center,We are grateful to the Bipartisan Policy Center for funding support.,,45,5,6,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

These results rely on agents' reacting solely to the economic content of these pressure tactics, ignoring any behaviorally based responses search deterrence may evoke. To test the validity of this assumption, this paper examines an experimental market where profit-maximizing strategy dictates that sellers should exercise one form of search deterrence, exploding offers. Sellers demonstrate a reluctance to use such offers against human buyers, but they are less reluctant to use them against computerized buyers. Human buyers are three times more likely to deviate from optimal strategy by rejecting rather than accepting these offers. Survey responses are consistent with other-regarding-preference-based reasons for sellers' actions but not buyers'. Taken together, these results suggest the benefits of tactics that rely on pressuring decision-makers may be more nebulous than previously thought. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Truncation VCG works by first truncating valuations at budgets, and then implementing standard VCG on the truncated valuations. I also provide maximal domain results, characterizing when it is possible to implement Pareto optimal outcomes and, if so, providing an implementing mechanism.

Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class-adults between the median and the 90th percentile-has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014.","[Piketty, Thomas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Paris Sch Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Piketty, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Paris Sch Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,"Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Laura and John Arnold foundation; NSF [SES-1156240, SES-1559014]; Russell Sage foundation; Sandler foundation; European Research Council under European Union [340831]",Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Laura and John Arnold foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Russell Sage foundation; Sandler foundation; European Research Council under European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley, the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Laura and John Arnold foundation, NSF grants SES-1156240 and SES-1559014, the Russell Sage foundation, the Sandler foundation, and the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC Grant Agreement No. 340831.",,69,388,436,15,175,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

It starts with a synthesis of available evidence on the drivers and consequences of privatization and nationalization. Then it develops a dynamic model of the choice between private and national regimes for the ownership of natural resources. The choice is driven by a basic equality-efficiency trade-off: national ownership results in more redistribution of income and more equality but undermines incentives for effort. We discuss how the resolution of the trade-off depends on external variables-such as the commodity price-and domestic ones-such as the tax system.

We derive the optimality conditions for linear income taxation, commodity taxation, and public provision of private and public goods for the poverty minimization case and compare the results to those derived under a general welfarist objective function.

This result has been criticized on the grounds that it ignores the possible disincentive effect of taxation on work effort, and the resolution of this critique has been a longstanding problem in public finance. This paper provides a normative rationale for progressivity that takes into account the effect of an income tax on labor supply.

Our model imposes a Malthusian constraint on food, but introduces a second good to the analysis that affects living standards without affecting population growth. We show that technological change does a good job explaining historical consumption patterns and population dynamics, including the Neolithic Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Great Divergence. Our theory stands in contrast to models that assume a single composite good and a Malthusian constraint. These models generate negligible growth prior to the Industrial Revolution. However, recent revisions to historical data show that historical living standards-though obviously much lower than today's-varied over time and space much more than previously thought. These revisions include updates to Maddison's dataset, which served as the basis for many papers taking long-run stagnation as a point of departure. This new evidence suggests that the assumption of long-run stagnation is problematic.

Because skills are not perfectly transferable, the Diamond-Mirrlees theorem (according to which the second-best entails production efficiency) fails: social welfare can be increased by inducing some agents to join the sector in which their productivity is not the highest. At the optimum, income taxes balance the marginal losses from inter-sector migration with the marginal gains from tailoring tax schedules to the distribution of productivities in each sector (tagging). A calibrated model indicates that sector-specific taxation generates substantive welfare gains when skill transferability decreases with income, as it enables the government to increase average taxes on high earners with large wage premia.","[Gomes, Renato; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Pavan, Alessandro] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Northwestern University,"Lozachmeur, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",Jean-marie.lozachmeur@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,43,17,21,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In contrast, this paper examines sanctions when the sender and target are embedded in a network of linkages to other agents and each agent's utility is a function of the size of the agent's component. Efficacy of sanctions is then a function of two factors: the network structure binding the sender and target, and the concavity/convexity of utility in the component size. We consider both unilateral sanctions and multilateral sanctions. We demonstrate how the network architecture, together with the specification of utility, qualifies and sometimes reverses the main tenets of the dyadic approach. We add to the recent work on identifying network architectures that sustain cooperation via the threat of exclusion by showing that the utility specification matters. Thus the same network can be efficacious for sanctions if utility is convex in component size but not if it is concave. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The implied response closely approximates the decline in the unemployment rate following the benefit cut, suggesting that, even in a period of high unemployment, the labor market absorbed the influx of workers without crowding out other job seekers.","[Johnston, Andrew C.] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Mas, Alexandre] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mas, Alexandre] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnston, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",,,"Johnston, Andrew/0000-0003-0447-6412",,,,,65,36,44,6,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future.","[Mankiw, N.

Our tests are nonparametric in nature, and use sieve estimators of the characteristic function. We provide formal power analysis against global as well as against local alternatives. Moreover, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation study, and apply the tests to analyze the degree of nonlinearity in a heterogeneous random coefficients demand model.

The supplier's adverse-selection problem can be solved if the downstream firm has established a reputation for delivering high quality with the supplier. The supplier may enter the market by initially renting the downstream firm's reputation. The downstream firm may optimally source its input externally, even though sourcing internally would be better in terms of productive efficiency. Since an entrant in the downstream market may lack reputation, it may suffer from a reputational barrier to entry arising from higher input costs-this constitutes a novel theory of downstream barriers to entry.

We characterize the effect of shocks that deplete enforcement resources on the aggregate default rate and credit supply. In the model default decisions by entrepreneurs are strategic complements, leading to multiple equilibria. We propose a global game selection to overcome equilibrium indeterminacy and show how shocks that deplete enforcement capacity can lead to a spike in the aggregate default rate and trigger credit rationing.

The WTO Information Technology Agreement's (ITA) unique setting allows us to overcome the challenges associated with identifying effects of non-discriminatory trade policies due to two reasons: (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of several passive signatories joining the agreement as an unavoidable part of pursuing a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA's partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for identification based on cross-product variation. Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains - over and above tariff reductions - especially for intermediate goods. The commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, adds another two layers, boosting both imports and exports more than equivalent unilateral reforms. This commitment spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in passive signatories. (C) 2018 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We further investigate this issue by departing from the bulk of the literature in three ways: (1) rather than maximize only tax revenue, governments also put positive weight on the income generated by resident-owned firms; (2) under preferential taxation, firms are distinguished by their country of origin; and (3) the competing regions are allowed to differ in size. Under the assumption of uniformly-distributed moving costs, identical regions always prefer the non-preferential regime. But when a small and large region compete, the small region prefers the preferential regime in some cases. We also identify non-uniform distributions of moving costs where the preferential regime is preferred by identical competing regions. This finding is related to differences in tax-base elasticities.

Revisiting distributional issues in a portfolio framework under different exchange rate regimes,METROECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OPEN-ECONOMY; INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION; INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; GROWTH-MODEL; BALANCE; PAYMENTS; WEALTH; POLICY,"Is demand in capitalist economies wage-led or profit-led, and does this matter over time? Empirical studies have found conflicting results for different countries and periods. Possible reasons may include the endogeneity of distributional shares, differences in the monetary policy/exchange rate regimes across countries, and divergence between macro behavior in the short- and medium-runs. I theoretically explore these possibilities using a portfolio balance framework to keep track of asset stocks and wealth effects over time. With fixed exchange rates, the Central Bank's need to intervene in the asset market via official reserve transactions results in assigning a crucial role to the current account in constraining demand and output. The binding nature of this constraint vanishes with flexible exchange rates. Regardless of the exchange rate regime, the most important message that emerges is that, once we impose plausible constraints on dynamic behavior, the demand regime may cease to determine the effect of redistribution on the steady state levels of utilization, profit rates, capital and wealth.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Econ, 814 Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2018,69,4,,,,,708,736,,10.1111/meca.12209,0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW3VZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000446838300001,0

Competitive wind deployment in the reference scenario achieves these outcomes with lower electricity prices than a scenario with wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. Lower fossil fuel and electricity prices benefit low-income households, but the dominant economic impacts are driven by increased electric sector investment and capital returns, which primarily benefit those with higher incomes. Overall, cost-competitive wind provides benefits to the U.S. economy that are initially low but rise beyond 2030 to achieve cumulative welfare and GDP improvements of $110 and $111 billion through 2050. Prescribing additional wind deployment (meeting 35% of demand by 2050) increases post-2030 electricity prices but not more so than keeping wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. The negative effect of higher prices on welfare, however, is outweighed by higher returns from the additional wind investment. While these changes favor higher income classes, we find economy-wide benefits through 2040. These benefits diminish by 2050, but the cumulative additional gains through 2050, beyond the reference case, are $192 billion in welfare and $150 billion in GDP.

We evaluate an incentive-compatible risk and time preference experiment conducted on a sample of student smokers and nonsmokers at the University of Cape Town in 2012. We adopt a full information maximum likelihood statistical framework, which is consistent with the data generating processes proposed by structural theories and accounts for subject errors in decision making, to explore the relationship between risk preferences, time preferences, and addiction. Across different theories and econometric specifications, we find no differences in the risk preferences of smokers and nonsmokers but do find that smokers discount significantly more heavily than nonsmokers. We also identify a nonlinear effect of smoking intensity on discounting behavior and find that smoking intensity increases the likelihood of discounting hyperbolically, which means heavier smokers may be more prone to time inconsistency and more recalcitrant to treatment. These results highlight the importance of the theory-experimental design-econometric trinity and have important implications for theories of addiction.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Hofmeyr, Andre; Ross, Don] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ross, Don] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol Philosophy Criminol Govt & Polit, Cork, Ireland; [Swarthout, J.

Evidence from House Prices,REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,inequality; Egypt; house prices; top incomes,CONSUMPTION,"Household income surveys often fail to capture top incomes, which leads to an underestimation of income inequality. A popular solution is to combine the household survey with data from income tax records, which has been found to result in significant upward corrections of inequality estimates. Unfortunately, tax records are unavailable in many countries, including most of the developing world. In the absence of data from tax records, this study explores the feasibility of using data on house prices to estimate the top tail of the income distribution. In an application to Egypt, where estimates of inequality based on household surveys alone are low by international standards, the study finds strong evidence that inequality is indeed being underestimated by a considerable margin. The Gini index of household per capita income for urban Egypt is found to increase from 39 to 52 after correcting for the missing top tail.","[van der Weide, Roy; Lakner, Christoph; Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"van der Weide, R (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rvanderweide@worldbank.org,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021",,U.

In parallel, there has been substantial reallocation of labor income from occupations relatively substitutable with ICT (routine) to ones relatively complementary (non-routine). These trends are consistent with the view that ICT allows for the mechanization of tasks that traditionally required labor, a process known as automation. Our calibration suggests that automation can account for half of the decline in the labor share, but that it is unlikely to be the sole driver of the decline in the routine labor income share. A representative agent framework suggests welfare gains of 4%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike all previous studies that use time invariant linear models, our approach reveals that the pre 1600 period is a turbulent economic period of high volatility that is only repeated in the 20th century. The repeating patterns in the conditional volatilities follow from aggregate supply shocks, while most of the inflation responses follow from aggregate demand shocks. Thus, we uncover that despite the technological growth and the various changes in the structure of the U.K. economy in the last century, the recurring patterns call for an examination of the true impact of the various policies on the economy.

Furthermore, students can specify financial aid in their preferences, and they can be matched with multiple colleges simultaneously. This clearinghouse keeps the desirable properties of decentralized college admissions, like commitment and yield management, while getting rid of the undesirable aspects, such as unfairness and unraveling. To study centralized college admissions, I advance the theory of stability for many-to-many matching markets with contracts. In particular, I show that the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm (SPDA) produces a stable matching even when college choice rules do not satisfy path independence (or substitutability) but when they have path-independent modifications. In addition, I provide a comparative statics for SPDA and introduce a new monotonicity condition on choice rules when contracts may have different weights to study yield management. My framework opens new avenues for market-design research and raises questions about the standard assumptions made in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Yenmez, M.

Using panel data from 1984 to 2014, I document that (i) developed countries exhibit larger inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), (ii) countries subject to high investment risk (IR) receive low FDI inflows, and (iii) IR is higher in fractionalized and politically unstable economies. These findings suggest a negative relationship between political instability and FDI through the IR channel. I inspect the theoretical mechanism using a dynamic political economy model of redistribution, wherein policymakers can expropriate resources from foreign investors. The proceeds are used to finance group-specific transfers to domestic workers but hinder economic growth by discouraging FDI. I show that the political equilibrium exhibits overexpropriation and underinvestment.","[Azzimonti, Marina] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Azzimonti, M (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.",marina.azzimonti@gmail.com,,"Azzimonti, Marina/0000-0001-6253-1622",,,,,40,14,16,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

We estimate that a 1% increase in the LBT rate decreases the LBT base by 0.45%, based on the universe of German LBT return files, which include corporations and unincorporated businesses. However, the fiscal equalization scheme largely compensates municipalities for the loss in the LBT base when they increase the LBT rate.

The literature has predominately focused on the case in which bidders are ex-ante symmetric and privately informed, and finds that aggressive bidding such that payoffs are negative is common (the winner's curse). In practice, bidders often only have access to public information, and use this information to form (possibly differing) beliefs. In addition, a bidder who is not privately informed may face bidders who are. We examine bidding behavior of both informed and uninformed bidders, and vary the information structure they face. We find that uninformed bidders underbid dramatically and persistently, while informed bidders tend to overbid in the two bidder case.

This intratemporal labor wedge can arise from product or labor market distortions. Based on employee wages, the literature has attributed the intratemporal wedge almost entirely to labor market distortions. Because wages may be smoothed versions of labor's true cyclical price, we instead examine the self-employed and intermediate inputs, respectively. For recent decades in the United States, we find price markup movements are at least as cyclical as wage markup movements. Thus, countercyclical price markups deserve a central place in business-cycle research, alongside sticky wages and matching frictions.","[Bils, Mark] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Harkness Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Klenow, Peter J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Malin, Benjamin A.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, 90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA",University of Rochester; Stanford University; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Bils, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Harkness Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",mark.bils@rochester.edu; klenow@startford.edu; benjamin.malin@mpls.frb.org,,,,,,,57,24,30,2,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Others argue that proper government oversight is necessary to protect ride-share passengers from driver error or vehicle parts failures and violence from unlicensed strangers. Using U.S. county-level data from 2007 through 2015, we investigate whether the introduction of the ride-sharing service Uber is associated with changes in fatal vehicle crashes and crime. We find that Uber's entry lowers the rate of DUIs and fatal accidents. For some specifications, we also find declines in arrests for assault and disorderly conduct.

Overbuilding of durable capital such as housing requires a reallocation of productive resources to other sectors, which is facilitated by a reduction in the interest rate. When monetary policy is constrained, overbuilding induces a demand-driven recession with limited reallocation and low output. Investment in other capital initially declines due to low demand, but it later booms and induces an asymmetric recovery in which the overbuilt sector is left behind.

This paper assumes that they may be either face-to-face and take place at city centers or via referrals from social contacts. The paper presents a model of an economy whose urban structure consists of cities of different types. All cities produce a non-tradeable final good using ranges of tradeable intermediate varieties. Each city has an internal spatial structure: individuals commute to the CBD in order to work, when employed, and to seek jobs, when unemployed. Hiring by each intermediate producing firm is subject to frictions, which are modeled in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides fashion. City type is conferred by specialization in producing one of two types of intermediate varieties and there is intercity trade in intermediate varieties. The paper examines properties of equilibrium with intercity trade and its dependence on various parameters and their consequences for unemployment, output and welfare across the economy along a steady state. The model's use of international trade tools confers a central role to labor market tightness, akin to factor intensity. A natural dependence of unemployment on city size is generated. Equilibrium outcomes generically diverge from the planner's optimum: there exists mismatch generically. Socially optimal unemployment trades off the probability of employment to search costs of firms independently for each skill type and independently of city size. Socially optimal city sizes are independent of the matching model and therefore labor market tightness considerations but reflect both market size effects and the skill composition of the economy.

Results support cointegration and suggest a single common I(1) factor driving all three variables. Impulse responses to a permanent shock to the common factor indicate an important long-run relationship between oil prices, producer prices, and consumer prices. Impulse responses to a transitory oil price shock show no consumer price index response and only weak evidence of a short-run response in the producer price index. Hence, the conclusion is that oil price shocks have to be perceived as permanent before there is a strong link to consumer prices. Policy focused on ameliorating the effects of oil price shocks should pay close attention to whether shocks are permanent or transitory. Conclusions are robust to alternative measures of consumer prices and over different sub-samples of the data, although there is some evidence that the cointegration relationships disappear in the latter part of the sample.

Higher fundamental inequality, working through the aspirations gap, motivates people to work and save more. Economic outcomes improve but income and consumption inequality worsen because the poor have less capacity to respond on the labor market. By diverting resources from health production, aspirations also worsen mortality, especially for the poor. Though relative income has a strong negative effect on personal health, inequality has a weak effect on population health, explaining an empirical puzzle on the relative income and health gradient.

This observation has led some economists, most notably Friedrich Hayek, to conclude that recessions often reflect periods of needed liquidation resulting from past over-investment. According to the main proponents of this view, government spending or any other form of aggregate demand policy should not be used to mitigate such a liquidation process, as doing so would simply result in a needed adjustment being postponed. In contrast, ever since the work of Keynes, many economists have viewed recessions as periods of deficient demand that should be countered by activist fiscal policy. In this paper we reexamine the liquidation perspective of recessions in a setup where prices are flexible but where not all trades are coordinated by centralized markets. The model illustrates why liquidations likely cause recessions characterized by deficient aggregate demand and accordingly suggests that Keynes' and Hayek's views of recessions may be closely linked. In our framework, interventions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand face a trade-off whereby current stimulus postpones the adjustment process and therefore prolongs the recessions, but where some stimulative policies may nevertheless remain desirable.","[Beaudry, Paul] Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Galizia, Dana] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Portier, Franck] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Portier, Franck] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carleton University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Portier, F (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Portier, F (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",Franck.Portier@TSE-fr.eu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Portier, Franck/0000-0001-9409-3946",,,,,36,20,20,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We exploit cross-city variation in local housing booms, which improved labor market opportunities for young men and women. We find that the boom lowered college enrollment, with effects concentrated at two-year colleges. The decline in enrollment during the boom was generally reversed during the bust; however, attainment remains persistently low for particular cohorts, suggesting that reduced educational attainment is an enduring effect of the recent housing cycle. The housing boom can account for approximately 25 percent of the recent slowdown in college attainment.","[Charles, Kerwin Kofi] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Charles, Kerwin Kofi; Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hurst, Erik] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] Northwestern Univ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Northwestern University,"Charles, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Charles, KK (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kerwin.charles@gmail.com; erik.hurst@chicagobooth.edu; noto@northwestern.edu,"Hurst, Erik/W-4996-2019",,Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of British Columbia; Einaudi Institute,Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of British Columbia; Einaudi Institute,"Charles: Harris School, University of Chicago, 1155 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, and NBER (email: kerwin.charles@gmail.com); Hurst: Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, 5807 S.

The program starts early in life (at 8 weeks of age) and is evaluated by an RCT. There are multiple treatment effects which we summarize through interpretable aggregates. Girls have a greater number of statistically significant treatment effects than boys and effect sizes for them are generally bigger. The source of this difference is worse home environments for girls with greater scope for improvement by the program. Fathers of sons support their families more than fathers of daughters.

Using panel data for 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, we find that there is a close link between urbanization and the size of the public sector, especially when looking at education, health care, and social issues. Various robustness checks confirm this finding. An analysis of state-level public spending in Colombia and Germany confirms our hypothesis on the subnational level. On the microeconomic level, people in urban areas acknowledge that governments should take more responsibility, and they are more in favor of redistribution. This finding can help to explain the evolution of government size, and it can also predict the present and future needs of urbanizing areas.","[Jetter, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Jetter, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Jetter, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Western Australia; University of Miami; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",mjetter7@gmail.com; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,,"Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200",,,,,42,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

It assesses the impact of President Trump's alienation of traditional US allies, which threatens to splinter the hegemonic coalition and even push China and Europe together, and his convergence toward some Chinese norms on trade and even politics. It outlines three possible systemic scenarios: a G0 in which the US is no longer willing to lead but China is not yet able or willing, and whether such a (likely) regime will be stable or unstable; a new G1, sooner or later, led by China; and a cooperative G2 in which the US and China agree to share leadership. It traces the evolution of actual leadership initiatives of the two countries in recent years. It compares US and Chinese attitudes on key systemic issues and concludes with an appraisal of an international economic order with Chinese characteristics, a world in which the state plays a greater role relative to market economics, the rule of law defers increasingly to voluntary arrangements, and politics tilt toward central government control more than democracy.","[Bergsten, C.

In an otherwise standard model of production heterogeneity that integrates institutional differences in the degree of financial development and the rule of law, we quantify the effects of these institutions on aggregate outcomes and economic development. The model accounts for the patterns across establishments in access to finance and crime as obstacles to their operation. Weaker financial development and rule of law have substantial negative effects on aggregate output, reducing output per capita by 50 percent. Weak rule-of-law institutions substantially amplify the negative impact of financial frictions.

The cause of reproducible research was set back many years. Currently it appears that the AER intends to reproduce articles prior to publication; this would be a horrible mistake.","[McCullough, B.

Among other considerations, smart sentencing policy depends on how sentence severity affects recidivism. Using administrative data on two common non-violent felonies committed by adults in Michigan, we measure the effect of sentences on offenders' future criminal activity. Discontinuities in the legislative guidelines that constrain sentences chosen by Michigan judges provide exogenous variation in sentence severity. Harsher sentences generated by sentencing guidelines significantly reduce recidivism by felony shoplifters but not repeat drunk drivers. Recidivism falls most for young, male offenders from Southeast Michigan and varies non-monotonically with prior criminal record. Because of such heterogeneity, any empirical strategy measures a local average treatment effect relevant to a particular population of offenders. Contrary to our main results, we find no evidence that harsher sentences induced by judge assignments reduce recidivism in our sample. When sentencing guidelines provide the primary practical policy lever, smart justice should incorporate directly relevant empirical evidence that accounts for offense- and offender-specific tradeoffs between public safety and the public budget.

We estimate that a 1000 DICK ($160) increase in a father's obligation is associated with a 273 DKK ($45) increase in his payment. A higher obligation reduces father-child co-residence, pointing to substitution between financial and non-pecuniary investments. Further, obligations increase post-separation fertility among remarried fathers, but have no impacts on maternal fertility or either parent's labor supply. Our findings suggest that government efforts to increase child investments through mandates on parents can be complicated by their behavioral responses to them. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Household hours account on average for nearly half of the total hours worked in the household and the market. The vast majority of household hours produce services. As GDP per capita increases, average total hours worked and average household hours per working-age population decrease while average market hours increase (marketization); hours producing services increase their share in total hours (structural transformation). The decrease in household hours is mostly due to changes in housework (cleaning, cooking etc.) and marketization is mostly due to changes in women's hours. Within countries, more educated people work more in the market and less in the household. We also impute the labor productivity of household production for 34 countries of our sample.

In this paper, by considering econometric models involving simultaneous discrete systems of equations, we study how the information available to economic agents regarding other economic agents can influence whether or not these strategic information parameters can be inferred from the observed actions. We consider two extreme cases: the complete information case where the information sets of participating economic agents coincide and the incomplete information case where each agent's payoffs are privately observable. We find that in models with complete information, the strategic interaction parameters are more difficult to recover than they are in incomplete information models. We show this by exploring the Fisher information (from standard statistics literature) for the strategic interaction parameters in each of these models. Our findings are that in complete information models, the statistical (Fisher) information for the interaction parameters is zero, implying the difficulty in recovering them from data. In contrast, for incomplete information models, the Fisher information for the interaction parameters is positive, indicating that not only can these parameters be relatively easy to recover from data, but standard inference can be conducted on them. This finding is illustrated in two cases: treatment effect models (expressed as a triangular system of equations) and static game models.","[Khan, Shakeeb] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA USA",Boston College; University of Virginia,"Khan, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",shakeeb.khan@bc.edu; denis@virginia.edu,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Support from the NSF is gratefully acknowledged.

The risk-neutral version of the stochastic price model is typically used in academic work; however, risk-adjusted models of the expected spot price are often used in practice. These two approaches are connected by a risk premium which is unfortunately often difficult to estimate. In this work, we use natural gas futures prices in a Kalman filter approach with maximum likelihood estimation to parameterize the Schwartz and Smith (2000) stochastic price model, and then apply an asset pricing model to address the large uncertainty of the risk premia parameter estimates. To evaluate the impact of the risk premia and other parameters in the two-factor price model on project valuation, we apply the price model to a prototypical shale gas investment, both for a base reference case as well as for cases where there are real options to optimally time decisions to invest or to abandon the project. Using this approach, we are able to determine the implied risk-adjusted discount rate that would be used with the spot price forecast, given the two-factor model risk premia, and we also discuss the impact of the risk premia on project value relative to other model parameters.

The price spread between WTI and Brent is also an important benchmark itself as the spread affects international trade in oil, refiner margins, and the price of refined products globally. In addition, the shapes of the WTI and Brent futures curves reflect supply and demand fundamentals in the U.S. versus the world market, respectively. On the analysis of the relationship between the two futures prices, we identify a structural break in the WTI Brent price spread in January 2011 and a break in the corresponding shapes of the futures curves around the same time. The structural break was a consequence of a dramatic rise in U.S. production due to fracking, a series of supply disruptions in Europe, binding storage constraints, and the U.S. crude oil export ban. These events are studied in the context of a simulation model of world oil prices. We reproduce the stylized facts of the oil market and conclude that the 2011 break in pricing structure was consistent with standard commodity storage theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, if in the reported results, a researcher selects the bandwidth based on this analysis, the associated confidence intervals (CIs) may not have correct coverage, even if the estimator is unbiased. This article proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such situations: replace the normal quantile with a critical value that depends only on the kernel and ratio of the maximum and minimum bandwidths the researcher has entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in coverage for conventional CIs. For a range of relevant cases, a conventional 95% CI has coverage between 70% and 90%, and our adjustment amounts to replacing the conventional critical value 1.96 with a number between 2.2 and 2.8.

Using multiple sources of data for counties in Kentucky, we compare various measures of meth manufacturing in wet, moist, and dry counties. Our preferred estimates address the endogeneity of local alcohol policies by exploiting differences in counties' religious compositions between the 1930s, when most local-option votes took place, and recent years. Even controlling for current religious affiliations, religious composition following the end of national Prohibition strongly predicts current alcohol restrictions. We carefully examine the validity of our identifying assumptions, and consider identification under alternative assumptions.

If a risk-averse executive faces price risk through his incentive contract, changes in stock volatility due to dividend taxes may increase agency costs and therefore decrease overall welfare. In this paper, I use a decrease in dividend taxes as a natural experiment to identify their effect on the firm's idiosyncratic stock return volatility. Stock volatility decreased after the tax cut for firms at which executives have larger sensitivity to stock price in their incentive compensation package relative to firms at which executives have a smaller sensitivity. Therefore, with risk-averse executives and risk-neutral shareholders, dividend taxes may exacerbate agency costs. The increase in agency costs will decrease shareholder welfare, which can be partially offset by the use of options in the employment contract.","[Ferris, Erin E.

I develop and estimate a structural.model capable of explaining the patterns of both equity extraction and default observed among this group of homeowners. In the model, households who have taken out equity have both higher loan-to-value ratios and increased mortgage payments relative to their income, a combination that makes them more likely to default. Using this model to analyze a policy that limits the maximum size of cash-out refinances to 80% of the current house value, I find that this restriction would reduce defaults by 18%, partially by inducing households to purchase less expensive homes.

First, we study the extent to which teacher qualifications often considered important inputs to classroom quality are valued by providers during the hiring process. We then examine the impact of state regulations on hiring decisions. To do so, a resume audit study was administered in which job-seeker characteristics were randomly assigned to resumes that were submitted in response to real child care job postings in 14 U.S. cities. Our results indicate that center-based providers may not hire the most qualified applicants. For example, we find that although providers have a strong preference for individuals with previous work experience in early childhood education (ECE), those with more ECE experience are less likely to receive an interview than those with less experience. We also find that individuals with bachelor's degrees in ECE are no more likely to receive an interview than their counterparts at the associate's level. Our analysis of state regulations shows that they strongly influence teacher hiring decisions. We find that providers' advertised job requirements are largely in compliance with the state standards for teachers' experience and education. In addition, providers are substantially more likely to interview job-seekers who meet these requirements. Given that most providers voluntarily exceed the state regulations, a tentative conclusion is that such rules have a limited effect on child care supply and prices.","[Boyd-Swan, Casey] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",cboydswa@kent.edu; chris.herbst@asu.edu,"Boyd-Swan, Casey/O-9892-2019","Boyd-Swan, Casey/0000-0003-3869-5648",College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU; Smith Richardson Foundation [2016-1160],College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU; Smith Richardson Foundation,"The authors contributed equally to this project and are considered co-lead authors.

Under favorable contracts, the study found that 58% of sample farmers were willing to adopt oilseeds as bio-energy crops and initially contribute an average of 160 acres of land for production per farm. Concerning farmers' adoption decisions, factors such as experience growing oilseed crops, availability of a nearby crushing facility, use of no till, being a first adopter and having a college degree positively affected adoption, while risk behavior, farm experience and gender negatively affected adoption. With regard to the land allocation decision, factors such as farm income and gender positively affected land allocation decisions, whereas percentage of land rented on a crop share basis, profit ratio (wheat/canola) and livestock ownership negatively affected land allocation decisions.

Subjects make choices under uncertainty and their choices reveal valuable information that is biased due to the presence of unobservables.

The analysis focuses on the relationship between category architecture and the type of information which can be credibly disclosed by firms' category choices to consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It argues that at the heart of the failure were the wrong microfoundations, which failed to incorporate key aspects of economic behaviour, e.g. incorporating insights from information economics and behavioural economics. Inadequate modelling of the financial sector meant they were ill-suited for predicting or responding to a financial crisis; and a reliance on representative agent models meant they were ill-suited for analysing either the role of distribution in fluctuations and crises or the consequences of fluctuations on inequality. The paper proposes alternative benchmark models that may be more useful both in understanding deep downturns and responding to them.","[Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jes322@columbia.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Columbia Business School,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Columbia Business School,"I wish to acknowledge the helpful comments of David Vines and Matthieu Teachout, and the editorial assistance of Debarati Ghosh.

First, we discuss why the case of Argentina is generally regarded as exceptional: the country was among the richest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century, but it gradually lost this place of privilege. We discuss that most explanations regarding the hypothesis of Argentine Exceptionalism fall into one or several of four categories. The first explanation is to challenge the exceptionalism hypothesis, either by arguing that the country was not so rich at the beginning of the 20th century or that it is not so poor now. The second explanation states that the country failed to generate growth supporting institutions despite its wealth, thus leading to a relative decline in its income level. The next explanation is that the country faced a series of adverse external shocks which disfavored what had been a successful growth model. Finally, scholars have also stated that exceptionalism is a consequence of poor policy choices, in particular a tendency towards state intervention and isolationism. Next, we introduce the remaining papers of the special collection and how they relate to the aforementioned hypothesis. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks regarding this article.","[Glaeser, Edward L.; Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.; Di Tella, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Llach, Lucas] Banco Cent Republ Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rditella@hbs.edu,,,,,,,30,13,18,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

There is some empirical literature dedicated to test the double dividend hypothesis of an environmental tax reform using CGE models. This hypothesis claims that is possible to obtain an improvement of both environmental and economic conditions by imposing an environmental tax and recycling revenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes. This research provides a comprehensive review of this literature including a statistical and a meta-regression analysis. 69 different simulations from 40 studies have been analyzed. 55% of simulations have achieved a double dividend, concluding that although the environmental dividend is almost always achieved, the economic dividend still remains an ambiguous question that needs further research.

Traders agree to disagree about the precisions of their continuous flows of Gaussian private information. The price depends on a trader's inventory (permanent price impact) and the derivative of a trader's inventory (temporary price impact). More disagreement makes the market more liquid; without enough disagreement, there is no trade. Target inventories mean-revert at the same rate as private signals. Actual inventories smoothly adjust towards target inventories at an endogenous rate which increases with disagreement. Faster-than-equilibrium trading generates flash crashes by increasing temporary price impact. A Keynesian beauty contest dampens price fluctuations.","[Kyle, Albert S.; Wang, Yajun] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Obizhaeva, Anna A.] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; New Economic School,"Obizhaeva, AA (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia.",aobizhaeva@nes.ru,,,,,,,55,23,28,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment.

In Brazil, wage inequality has steadily declined since the early 1990s. Counterfactual exercises show that the evolutions of the schooling and experience premiums are key determinants of the decline in inequality. The 2000s witnessed a rapid decline in the schooling and experience premiums, at the same time as the working population was aging and becoming more educated. To understand these changes, the paper develops a model of imperfect substitution across experience and education groups and estimates the relevant elasticities of substitution. Changes in labor supply contributed significantly to the decline of the experience and education premiums, but are not enough to account fully for the observed changes. The demand for experience shifted in favor of younger workers, while the relative demand for college graduates declined during the 2000s.","[Fernandez, Manuel] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Messina, Julian] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Messina, Julian] IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany",University of Essex; Inter-American Development Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Messina, J (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",m.fernandersierra@essex.ac.uk; julianm@IADB.ORG,"Messina, Julian/ABE-9287-2021","Fernandez Sierra, Manuel/0000-0002-6447-6337; Messina, Julian/0000-0002-3635-499X",,,,,44,11,14,4,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We show how the persistent nature of household debt shapes the answer to this question. In environments where households repay mortgages gradually, surprise interest hikes only weakly influence household debt, and tend to increase debt-to-GDP in the short run while reducing it in the medium run.

Simple examples show that even if the planner's goal (expressed by a social choice correspondence (SCC)) depends only on ordinal information, eliciting cardinal information may help with incentives. However, if agents may be uncertain about their own cardinal preferences, then a strong robustness requirement can justify the focus on ordinal mechanisms. Specifically, when agents' preferences over pure outcomes are strict, if a planner is able to implement an SCC (in ex post equilibrium) using a mechanism that is robust to interdependence of arbitrary form in cardinal preferences, then there must exist such a mechanism that elicits only ordinal preferences. The strictness assumption can be dropped if we further allow the possibility of non-expected-utility preferences.","[Carroll, Gabriel] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Carroll, G (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gdc@stanford.edu,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

A factor structured covariance offers a range of alternatives between these two assumptions. However, because these models are more difficult to estimate they are not frequently used to model preference heterogeneity. This paper develops a simple expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating mixed logit models when preferences are generated from a factor structured covariance. The algorithm is easy to implement for both exploratory and confirmatory factor models. The estimator is applied to stated-preference survey data from residential energy customers (Train, 2007). Comparing the fit across five different models, which differed in their assumptions on the covariance of preferences, the results show that all three factor specifications produced a better fit of the data than the fully correlated model measured by BIC and two out of three performed better in terms of AIC.","[James, Jonathan] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"James, J (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",jjames04@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,22,4,4,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The original FTPL rests on a fundamental compounded fallacy: confusing the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) of the State, holding with equality and with sovereign bonds priced at their contractual values, with a misspecified equilibrium nominal bond pricing equation, and the 'double use' of this IBC. This generates a number of internal inconsistencies and anomalies. The FTPL is not about endogenous money issuance guaranteeing solvency of the State when public spending and taxes are exogenous. The problem is not about empirical content or the realism of the assumptions, but about flawed internal logic. The issue is not just of academic interest. If fiscal authorities were to take the FTPL seriously, costly policy accidents, including sovereign default and hyperinflation, could result. Interpreting the FTPL as an equilibrium selection mechanism in models with multiple equilibria does not help. Attempts by Sims to extend the FTPL to models with nominal price rigidities fail. The attempted resurrection of the FTPL fails.","[Buiter, Willem H.] Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Sibert, Anne C.] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA.",willem.buiter@citi.com,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 2,2018,12,,,,,,,,201848,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-48,0,,,56,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GQ0PM,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000441321700001,0

Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that the cost of providing ADSL-based broadband services in a given municipality depends on its relative position in the pre-existing voice telecommunications infrastructure. We first show that broadband Internet had a substantial negative effect on turnout in parliamentary elections up until 2008. It was, however, positively associated with other forms of political participation, both online and offline, such as the emergence of local online grassroots protest movements. The negative effect of the Internet on turnout in parliamentary elections essentially reversed after 2008, when local grassroots movements coalesced into the Five-Star Movement electoral list. Our findings support the view that: (i) the effect of the Internet varies across different forms of political participation; (ii) it changes over time, as new political actors emerge that are able to take advantage of the new technology to attract disenchanted or demobilized voters; and (iii) these new forms of mobilization eventually feed back into the mainstream electoral process, converting exit back into voice.

Three alternative trade structures are implemented: (a) a standard specification of perfect competition based on the Armington assumption of regionally differentiated goods; (b) monopolistic competition among symmetric manufacturing firms; and (c) a competitive selection model of heterogeneous manufacturing firms. Across these structures the DCFTA indicates relatively large gains for Ukraine of more than 3 percent. We show, however, that the gains for Ukraine are lower when we consider monopolistic competition in manufacturing. This is attributed to a movement of resources into Ukraine's traditional export sectors to the EU, which produce under constant returns. While there is little danger of deindustrialization dominating the overall welfare gains, we do observe substantially lower gains when we consider monopolistic competition. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical confirmation of the theoretic predication that the relative gains from trade in monopolistic competition models might be lower than under perfect competition in the context of a numeric simulation of economic integration. Under the popular heterogeneous-firms monopolistic competition theory we find significant firm selection effects indicating welfare impacts for Ukraine that are less than under the Armington structure but above those found under symmetric firms and monopolistic competition. These results are important considerations for Ukraine's overall development strategy.","[Olekseyuk, Zoryana] German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Dept World Econ & Dev Financing, Bonn, Germany; [Balistreri, Edward J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Colorado School of Mines,"Olekseyuk, Z (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Dept World Econ & Dev Financing, Bonn, Germany.",zoryana.olekseyuk@die-gdi.de,"Balistreri, Edward J/A-6686-2013","Balistreri, Edward/0000-0001-6740-0066; Olekseyuk, Zoryana/0000-0001-9403-8234",,,,,42,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2018,45,3,,,,,507,542,,10.1007/s10663-017-9371-9,0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GM8BV,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000438433600004,0

Donors delegate aid implementation to strengthen aid selectivity, incentivizing policy improvements in recipient countries, which in turn improves the development effectiveness of aid. Aid delegation is optimal for donors who disagree on the optimal distribution of aid precisely when an agency represents the average donor.

It is shown theoretically that if enforcement is effective in deterring and constraining cartels then there will be fewer cartels with low overcharges and fewer with high overcharges. This prediction provides an indirect method for testing whether the enforcement of competition law is effective.

We argue that this claim conflates time consistency with two distinct properties of preferences: stationarity and time invariance. While time invariance and stationarity together imply time consistency, the converse does not hold. Although non-dictatorial social preferences cannot be stationary, they may be time consistent if time invariance is abandoned. If individuals are discounted utilitarians, revealed preference provides no guidance on whether social preferences should be time consistent or time invariant. Nevertheless, we argue that time invariant social preferences are often normatively and descriptively problematic. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Children in the integrated intervention arm (teacher training and parenting) had significantly higher scores in assessments of language and socio-emotional development than children in preschools receiving teacher training alone at the 18-month follow-up. There were significant improvements in classroom organization and teacher behavior at the preschools in the teacher-training only arm, but these did not translate into improved child outcomes at 18 months. We found no effects of any intervention on child assessments at the 36-month follow-up. Our findings suggest that, in resource-poor settings with informal preschools, programs that integrate parenting support with preschools may be more (cost-) effective for improving child outcomes than programs focusing simply on improving classroom quality.","[Ozler, Berk] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Fernald, Lia C.

This paper develops a New Keynesian small open economy model to show, analytically and numerically, that several prevalent features of LICs dependence on external financing, public investment inefficiency, and a low degree of home bias in public investment play important roles in government spending effects. External financing increases the resource envelope, mitigating the crowding out effects, but it tends to appreciate the real exchange rate, lowering traded output. Although capital scarcity in LICs implies high returns to public capital, low marginal investment efficiency can substantially dampen the output multiplier. Also, public investment may not be effective in stimulating output in the short run, as LICs often rely on imports to a large extent to carry out public investment projects, weakening its role as a short-run demand stimulus.","[Shen, Wenyi] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zanna, Luis-Felipe] Int Monetary Fund, Inst Capac Dev, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; National Sun Yat Sen University; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Yang, SCS (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;Yang, SCS (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",wenyi.shen@okstate.edu; syang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw; fzanna@imf.org,,,U.K.'s Department for International Development [60925]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,"U.K.'s Department for International Development; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors thank Andrew Foster and Douglas Gollin (the editors), Andrew Berg, Giovanni Melina, Catherine Pattillo, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Harmonized policy scenarios (including mass-based emissions limits and various power-sector-only carbon tax trajectories) across 16 models provide comparative assessments of potential impacts on electric sector investment and generation outcomes, emissions reductions, and economic implications. This paper compares results across these policy alternatives, including a variety of technological and natural gas price assumptions, and summarizes robust findings and areas of disagreement across participating models. Under a wide range of policy, technology, and market assumptions, model results suggest that future coal generation will decline relative to current levels while generation from natural gas, wind, and solar will increase, though the pace and extent of these changes vary by policy scenario, technological assumptions, region, and model. Climate policies can amplify trends already under way and make them less susceptible to future market changes. The model results provide useful insights to a range of stakeholders, but future research focused on intersectoral linkages in emission reductions (e.g., the role of electrification), effects of energy storage, and better coverage of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can improve insights even further.

IT countries with low trade and financial openness and with a large share of external debt exhibit a lower exchange rate flexibility than others.

We use a two-sector dynamic deterministic general equilibrium model with four different trends: hours worked, investment-specific productivity, formal productivity, and shadow productivity. We find that the shadow productivity trend is endogenous, in the sense that it is an exact function of model parameters and the other three trends. We also document that, in order to be consistent with observed (real-world) trend growths, the shadow sector needs to exhibit increasing returns to scale, which is contrary to the standard procedure of imposing decreasing returns to this sector. We apply our methodology to a set of seven Latin American and Asian countries and document several empirical regularities that emerge from our analysis, the most important one being that the volatility of shadow sector output is considerably larger than the one in formal sector output.","[Solis-Garcia, Mario] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Xie, Yingtong] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",Macalester College; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Solis-Garcia, M (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",msolisga@macalester.edu; yingtong.xie@wisc.edu,,,Allianz Life Insurance Company Student Summer Research Fund,Allianz Life Insurance Company Student Summer Research Fund,"We thank seminar participants at the 2016 Workshop on Macroeconomics Research at Liberal Arts Colleges, the 2016 Southern Economic Association meetings, the University of Minnesota's Freeman Center for International Economic Policy's Global Policy Seminar and Jests Rodriguez-Lopez, Gary Krueger, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We find that high levels of net foreign debt call for a policy with a significant degree of exchange rate management, which can constrain the extent of otherwise inefficient cross-border wealth transfers that arise due to debt valuation and risk premium effects. In particular, the central bank can improve consumer welfare by up to 0.1% of steady state consumption by responding to exchange rate fluctuations when domestic debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 100%. We also find that the ranking of optimal policy rules depends on the elasticity of import-export substitution. When home and foreign goods are complements, the responsiveness of the real exchange to shocks is muted, in turn mitigating the excessive cross-country wealth transfer associated with the debt valuation effect In this case, CPI targeting outperforms the nominal peg at high levels of debt by improving international risk sharing.","[Staveley-O'Carroll, James] Babson Coll, Econ Div, Westgate Hall,231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA; [Staveley-O'Carroll, Olena M.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 45A,One Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Babson College; College of the Holy Cross,"Staveley-O'Carroll, OM (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 45A,One Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jstaveleyocarroll1@babson.edu; omykhayl@holycross.edu,"StaveleyOCarroll, Josh/KBB-2855-2024",,,,,,63,5,5,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

At the same time, and in response to rising government debt levels, many of these countries have been engaging in fiscal consolidations that have had a negative impact on growth rates. We empirically explore the connections between these two facts by extending to longer horizons the methodology of Blanchard and Leigh (2013) regarding fiscal policy multipliers. Our results provide support for the presence of strong hysteresis effects of fiscal policy. The large size of the effects points in the direction of self-defeating fiscal consolidations as suggested by DeLong and Summers (2012).

Furthermore, Smith models, in part, his distinction between natural and violent on Aristotle's use. Smith explains the distinction in his study of the history of physics and astronomy. In those fields there is, at least going back to Aristotle, an idealized view of 'natural' motion or movement versus interfered or violent motion or movement, which has changed over time, particularly from ancient to classical physics and astronomy. Smith used this sense of 'natural' particularly when dealing with movement in The Wealth of Nations: especially the movement of goods, capital and labour.

We decompose the effect of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate borrowing into the product of banks' marginal propensity to lend (MPL) to borrowers and those borrowers' marginal propensity to borrow (MPB), aggregated over all borrowers in the economy. We apply our framework by estimating heterogeneous MPBs and MPLs in the U.S. credit card market. Using panel data on 8.5 million credit cards and 743 credit limit regression discontinuities, we find that the MPB is declining in credit score, falling from 59% for consumers with FICO scores below 660 to essentially zero for consumers with FICO scores above 740. We use a simple model of optimal credit limits to show that a bank's MPL depends on a small number of parameters that can be estimated using our credit limit discontinuities. For the lowest FICO score consumers, higher credit limits sharply reduce profits from lending, limiting banks' optimal MPL to these consumers. The negative correlation between MPB and MPL reduces the impact of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate household borrowing, and highlights the importance of frictions in bank-borrower interactions for understanding the pass-through of credit expansions.","[Agarwal, Sumit] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC USA; Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; CEPR, Cambridge, MD USA",Georgetown University; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Agarwal, S (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,"Agarwal, Sumit/F-4836-2012","Agarwal, Sumit/0000-0002-8305-3786",,,,,77,65,74,6,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Each firm chooses one of three possible strategies for running its advertising campaign. The two rival firms care only about capturing a dominant share of the relevant market. Hence, if a firm expects to capture dominant market share with probability p is an element of [0, 1], then its payoff in the game we study is also p. Our analysis leads to four results. First, we provide the normal form representation of the game between the new good producer and the remanufacturer. Second, we specify the game in matrix form. Third, we indicate what happens at each stage of the elimination of strictly dominated strategies.

This article provides ameta-analysis of prior experimental research and reports the results of a new experiment to elucidate how cooperation varies with the environment in this canonical game. We describe forces that affect initial play (formation of cooperation) and unraveling (breakdown of cooperation). First, contrary to the backward induction prediction, the parameters of the repeated game have a significant effect on initial cooperation. We identify how these parameters impact the value of cooperation-as captured by the size of the basin of attraction of always defect-to account for an important part of this effect. Second, despite these initial differences, the evolution of behavior is consistent with the unraveling logic of backward induction for all parameter combinations. Importantly, despite the seemingly contradictory results across studies, this article establishes a systematic pattern of behavior: subjects converge to use threshold strategies that conditionally cooperate until a threshold round; conditional on establishing cooperation, the first defection round moves earlier with experience. Simulation results generated from a learning model estimated at the subject level provide insights into the long-term dynamics and the forces that slow down the unraveling of cooperation.","[Embrey, Matthew] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Sussex; New York University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Embrey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"Embrey, Matthew/0000-0002-3423-4142",National Science Foundation [SES-1225779]; Center for Experimental Social Science,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Experimental Social Science,"We thank the editor, anonymous referees, James Andreoni, Yoella Bereby-Meyer, Russell Cooper, Pedro Dal Bo, Douglas DeJong, Robert Forsythe, Drew Fudenberg, Daniel Friedman, P.J.

Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects are our main focuses, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p being the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.","[Fernandez-Val, Ivan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Weidner, Martin] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Weidner, Martin] Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England",Boston University; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Fernández-Val, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ivanf@bu.edu; m.weidner@ucl.ac.uk,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016","Weidner, Martin/0000-0001-6135-6164",ESRC [ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,121,32,34,2,25,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

These episodes are also associated with a persistent increase in the share of income going to the top. We investigate three channels through which these impacts could occur. First, the impact of liberalization on inequality is stronger where credit markets lack depth and financial inclusion is low; positive impacts of liberalization on poverty rates also vanish when financial inclusion is low. Second, the impact on inequality is also stronger when liberalization is followed by a financial crisis. Third, liberalization seems to alter the relative bargaining power of firms and workers: the labor share of income falls in the aftermath of capital account liberalization.","[Furceri, Davide; Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org; ploungani@imf.org,,,,,,,43,68,75,5,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We show that older siblings causally affect younger siblings educational choices and early career earnings. We focus on critical course choices in high school and overcome the identification challenges of estimating spillover effects in education by exploiting exogenous variation in choice sets stemming from a pilot program. The pilot induced an essentially random subset of older siblings to choose advanced math-science at a lower cost, while not directly affecting the course choices of younger siblings. We find that younger siblings are 2-3 percentage points more likely to choose math science if their older sibling unexpectedly could choose math-science at a lower cost. We argue that the main influence of the pilot program on the younger siblings may be attributed to the social influence of the older sibling. Spillovers are strongest among closely spaced siblings, in particular brothers, and they have a lasting impact on the career outcomes of younger brothers. We argue that competition is likely one of the driving forces behind younger siblings conforming to their older siblings' choices.","[Joensen, Juanna Schroter] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Nielsen, Helena Skyt] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Chicago; Aarhus University,"Joensen, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jjoensen@uchicago.edu; hnielsen@econ.au.dk,,"Nielsen, Helena/0000-0003-2577-4734",,,,,51,37,44,3,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Management of complex dam, hydroelectric, and river systems frequently requires tradeoffs between alternative operational profiles, each with its own set of heterogeneous external effects. Substantial evidence suggests that segments of the public hold non-market values, including non-use values, for both riverine environmental effects and a wide array of external effects of hydropower production and distribution. However, non-market non-use valuation exercises related to re-purposing dam operations continue to focus exclusively on downstream external effects, calling into question their usefulness in decision-making processes. Focusing on the Glen Canyon Darn (GCD), a critical source of hydropower and peaking capacity on the Colorado River, US, we measure non-market values, expected to be significantly composed of non-use values, using the contingent valuation (CV) method for two proposed management options inclusive of multiple social, cultural, and environmental effects of both downstream riverine effects and hydropower production and distribution in the broader basin. To provide a defensible basis for inclusion of relevant external effects in the valuation exercise, we undertook a multi-year study of the GCD policy domain. Using a nationally-representative, address-based CV internet survey, results from an advisory referendum voting format suggest that the average US household has a median net willingness to pay (WTP) to continue existing GCD operations of $21.51 per year [95% CI: $2.98, $40.04] after accounting for WTP to change operations under the US Department of Interior's preferred alternative.

Using difference-in-differences estimation, it finds that, in the short run, the UCS had little or no impact on either savings or consumption expenditures. In the long run, the UCS still had no effect on savings, but there is some evidence of an increase in consumption. These effects are generally consistent with economic theory. The provision of healthcare coverage at little or no cost to previously uninsured households has an income effect that will increase both savings and consumption and a risk reduction effect that will reduce precautionary savings and thus increase consumption. These two effects on savings are of opposite sign and appear to cancel each other out, while both effects on consumption are positive and so appear to increase consumption, at least in the long run.","[Kirdruang, Phatta] Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",Thammasat University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Kirdruang, P (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",phatta@econ.tu.ac.th,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041023] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,29,4,4,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We show that adding the assumption that people are worse off when they experience low income as a result of leader betrayal (than when it is the result of bad luck) to a simple voter choice model yields a preference for incompetent leaders even if all leaders have the same underlying probability of betrayal. These deliver worse material outcomes in general, but they reduce the feelings of betrayal during bad times. Some evidence consistent with our model is gathered from the Trump-Clinton 2016 election: on average, subjects primed with the importance of competence in policymaking decrease their support for Trump, the candidate who scores lower on competence in our survey (even amongst Trump supporters). But two groups respond to the treatment with a large (approximately 5 percentage points) increase in their support for Donald Trump: those living in rural areas and those that are low educated, white and living in urban and suburban areas.","[Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Sch Business, NBER, CIfAR, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Rotemberg, Julio J.] Harvard Sch Business, NBER, Boston, MA 02163 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Rotemberg, JJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, NBER, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",rditella@hbs.edu; jrotemberg@hbs.edu,,,,,,,65,23,25,2,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

J,"Metcalf, G",,,,"Metcalf, Gabriel",,,Sand Castles Before the Tide? Affordable Housing in Expensive Cities,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH MACHINE,"This article focuses on cities with unprecedented economic success and a seemingly permanent crisis of affordable housing. In the expensive cities, policymakers expend great amounts of energy trying to bring down housing costs with subsidies for affordable housing and sometimes with rent control. But these efforts are undermined by planning decisions that make housing for most people vastly more expensive than it has to be by restricting the supply of new units even in the face of growing demand. I begin by describing current housing policy in the expensive metro areas of the United States. I then show how this combination of policies affecting housing, despite internal contradictions, makes sense from the perspective of the political coalitions that can form in a setting of fragmented local jurisdictions, local control over land use policies, and homeowner control over local government. Finally, I propose some more effective approaches to housing policy. My view is that the effects of the formal affordable housing policies of expensive cities are quite small in their impact when compared to the size of the problemlike sand castles before the tide. I will argue that we can do more, potentially much more, to create subsidized affordable housing in high-cost American cities. But more fundamentally, we will need to rethink the broader set of exclusionary land use policies that are the primary reason that housing in these cities has become so expensive. We cannot solve the problem unless we fix the housing market itself.","[Metcalf, Gabriel] SPUR, San Francisco Bay Area, CA 94105 USA",,"Metcalf, G (通讯作者)，SPUR, San Francisco Bay Area, CA 94105 USA.",,,,,,,,57,35,43,1,100,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We find that the growth in U.S. exports led to increased demand for 2 million jobs in manufacturing, 0.5 million in resource industries, and a remarkable 4.1 million jobs in services, totaling 6.6 million. Two-thirds of those service sectors jobs are due to the export of services themselves, whereas one-third is due to the intermediate demand from manufacturing and resource-or merchandise-exports, so the total labor demand gain due to merchandise exports was 3.7 million jobs. In comparison, U.S. merchandise imports from China led to reduced demand of 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing and 0.6 million in services (with small losses in resource industries), with total job losses of 2.0 million. It follows that the expansion in U.S. merchandise exports relative to imports from China over 1995-2011 created net demand for about 1.7 million jobs. Comparing the growth of U.S. merchandise exports to merchandise imports from all countries, we find a fall in net labor demand due to trade, but comparing the growth of total U.S. exports to total imports from all countries, then there is a rise in net labor demand because of the growth in service exports.","[Feenstra, Robert C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Feenstra, Robert C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sasahara, Akira] Univ Idaho, Coll Business & Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Feenstra, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rcfeenstra@ucdavis.edu,"Sasahara, Akira/AAO-3712-2021","Sasahara, Akira/0000-0002-4384-0806",,,,,29,66,74,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We discuss and introduce alternative adaptations of Gale's original procedure that can offer improvements over TTC in terms of equity, along with various other distributional considerations. Instead of giving all the trading power to those students with the highest priority for a school, we argue for the distribution of the trading rights of all slots of each school: This allows them to trade in a thick market where additional constraints can be accommodated by choosing an appropriate pointing rule. We propose a particular mechanism of this kind, the equitable top trading cycle (ETTC) mechanism, which is also Pareto efficient and group strategy-proof just like TTC and eliminates avoidable justified envy situations.

The objective of this article is to study the business cycle implications of such a decline. We first develop a tractable monetary model in which households face idiosyncratic unemployment risk that they can partially self-insure using savings. A low level of liquid household wealth opens the door to self-fulfilling fluctuations: if wealth-poor households expect high unemployment, they have a strong precautionary incentive to cut spending, which can make the expectation of high unemployment a reality. Monetary policy, because of the zero lower bound, cannot rule out such expectations-driven recessions. In contrast, when wealth is sufficiently high, an aggressive monetary policy can keep the economy at full employment. Finally, we document that during the U.S. Great Recession wealth-poor households increased saving more sharply than richer households, pointing towards the importance of the precautionary channel over this period.","[Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.;Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",,,,European Research Council [313671]; European Research Council (ERC) [313671] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank our editor, Gita Gopinath, and four anonymous referees for excellent suggestions.

Competing theories suggest a variety of political institutions as driving forces of social infrastructure, but the empirical literature has been hampered by the small set of available proxies, many of which are broadly defined. We leverage a new, comprehensive dataset that codes political institutions directly from countries' constitutions. By employing a statistical methodology that is designed to juxtapose candidate regressors associated with many competing theories, we test each individual political institution's effect on social infrastructure. Our results show that constitutional rules pertaining to executive constraints as well as to the structure of electoral systems are crucial for the development of high-quality social infrastructure. We also find that the determinants of social infrastructure are much more fundamental than previously thought: not only the general structure of electoral systems matter, but also highly detailed aspects such as limits on campaign contributions and the freedom to form parties. Moreover, the granularity of our data allows us to highlight the profound effect of basic human rights on social infrastructure, a dimension which has not been explored in the literature to date.","[Eicher, Theo S.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, Marseille, France; [Kuenzel, David J.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Wesleyan University,"Kuenzel, DJ (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St,PAC 123, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",dkuenzel@wesleyan.edu,"Kuenzel, David/L-4212-2019; Eicher, Theo/HZL-8034-2023","Kuenzel, David/0000-0001-7429-3246;",,,,,106,10,10,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations pass through to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013-15 appreciation was more muted. We also apply this framework to forecast the extent of pass-through from sterling's sharp depreciation corresponding to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This article reviews this history, beginning 1956 when the government first imposed an industry boundary between transmission of information on the one hand, and the creation and processing of information on the other. This regulatory legacy remains embedded in US law and has led to some of the muddle. This article also examines the academic literature relating to net neutrality. On this, the answers found in the literature vary depending on assumptions made about technology, industry structure, and industry practices. When the answer to the question of whether regulations are beneficial is it depends, and the scenarios that give different answers are realistic, it would seem that the policy approach should favor applying competition and consumer protection laws that address problems when they occur rather than ex ante regulations, which would be certain to harm at least in some situations.","[Jamison, Mark A.] Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Jamison, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jamisoma@ufl.edu,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The decades of research on discrimination in labor markets began with a regression-based decomposition approach, asking whether raw wage or earnings differences between groups-which might constitute prima facie evidence of discrimination-were in fact attributable to other productivity-related factors. Subsequent research-responding in large part to limitations of the regression-based approach-moved on to other approaches, such as using firm-level data to estimate both marginal productivity and wage differentials. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in experimental research on labor market discrimination-although the earliest experiments were done decades ago. Some experimental research on labor market discrimination takes place in the lab. But far more of it is done in the field, which makes this particular area of experimental research unique relative to the explosion of experimental economic research more generally. This paper surveys the full range of experimental literature on labor market discrimination, places it in the context of the broader research literature on labor market discrimination, discusses the experimental literature from many different perspectives (empirical, theoretical, and policy), and reviews both what this literature has taught us thus far, and what remains to be done.","[Neumark, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Neumark, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Neumark, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,185,193,219,21,161,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO2) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China's regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002-2011 except in 2003-04 and 2006-09 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level. Using robust tests, it can be found that the results are also reliable and robust to sub-samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I show that this problem has a strong parallel to Weitzman's (1974) classic model of using price or quantity controls to regulate an externality. Changes in fuel prices act as shocks to the marginal cost of complying with the standard. Assuming constant marginal damages from fuel consumption, an application of Weitzman (1974) implies that a fixed fuel economy standard reduces expected welfare relative to a price policy such as a feebate or, equivalently, a fuel economy standard that is indexed to the price of gasoline. When the regulator is constrained to use a fixed standard, I show that the usual approach to setting the standard equate expected marginal compliance cost to marginal damage is likely to be sub-optimal because the standard may not bind if the realized gasoline price is sufficiently high. Instead, the optimal fixed standard will be relatively relaxed and may be non-binding even at the expected gasoline price. Finally, I show that although an attribute-based standard allows vehicle choices to flexibly respond to gasoline price shocks, the resulting distortions imply that the optimal fuel economy standard is not attribute-based.","[Kellogg, Ryan] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kellogg, Ryan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kellogg, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",kelloggr@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,43,8,11,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

In contrast, the results are more mixed for the zero lower bound state, with a few specifications implying multipliers as high as 1.5.","[Ramey, Valerie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ramey, Valerie A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zubairy, Sarah] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ramey, VA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Ramey, VA (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,60,407,468,9,85,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Empirically, these workers have similar job finding rates but much lower and less volatile separation rates than their less educated peers. We argue that on-the-job training, being complementary to formal education, is the reason for this pattern. Using a search and matching model with endogenous separations, we show that investments in match-specific human capital reduce incentives to separate but leave the job finding rate essentially unaffected. The model generates unemployment dynamics quantitatively consistent with the data.

Both cities were conduits for moving meat and grain from fertile hinterlands to eastern markets. However, despite their initial similarities, Chicago was vastly more prosperous for most of the twentieth century. Can the differences between the cities after 1930 be explained by differences in the cities before that date? We highlight four major differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago in 1914. Chicago was slightly richer, and significantly better educated. Chicago was more industrially developed, with about 2.25 times more capital per worker. Finally, Chicago's political situation was far more stable and it was not a political capital. Human capital seems to explain the lion's share of the divergent path of the two cities and their countries, both because of its direct effect and because of the connection between education and political instability.","[Campante, Filipe; Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Campante, Filipe; Glaeser, Edward L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu,,,John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,Both authors thank the John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation for financial support.

Firm effects account for 40 percent of the total decrease and worker effects for 29 percent. Changes in observable worker and firm characteristics contributed little to these trends. Instead, the decrease is primarily due to a compression of returns to these characteristics, particularly a declining firm productivity-pay premium.

We show that financial constraints lead to two distinct types of pecuniary externalities: distributive externalities that arise from incomplete insurance markets and collateral externalities that arise from price-dependent financial constraints. For both types of externalities, we identify three sufficient statistics that determine optimal taxes on financing and investment decisions to implement constrained efficient allocations. We also show that fire sales and financial amplification are neither necessary nor sufficient to generate inefficient pecuniary externalities. We demonstrate how to employ our framework in a number of applications. Whereas collateral externalities generally lead to over-borrowing, the distortions from distributive externalities may easily flip sign, leading to either under- or over-borrowing. Both types of externalities may lead to under- or over-investment.","[Davila, Eduardo] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Korinek, Anton] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Korinek, Anton] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Korinek, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Korinek, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",akorinek@jhu.edu,,,Lamfalussy Fellowship of the ECB; Institute for New Economic Thinking; NFI; Rafael del Pino Foundation,Lamfalussy Fellowship of the ECB; Institute for New Economic Thinking; NFI; Rafael del Pino Foundation,"This article combines the manuscripts Systemic Risk-Taking: Amplification Effects, Externalities, and Regulatory Responses by Anton Korinek (2011) and Dissecting Fire Sales Externalities by Eduardo Davila (2014).

This has occasioned controversies among economists and philosophers around the normative limits of paternalism, especially by technical policy advisors. One recent suggestion has been that 'boosting,' in which interventions aim to enhance people's general cognitive skills and representational repertoires instead of manipulating their choice environments behind their backs, avoids the main normative challenges. A limitation in most of this literature is that it has focused on relatively sweeping policy recommendations and consequently on strong polar alternatives of general paternalism and strict laissez faire. We review a real instance, drawn from a consulting project we conducted for an investment bank, of a proposed intervention that is more typical of the kind that economists are more often actually called upon to offer. In this example, the sophistication of current tools for preference attribution, combined with philosophical externalism about the semantics of preferences that makes it less plausible to attribute their literal self-conscious representation to people as propositional attitude content becomes more tightly refined, blocks applicability of the distinction between nudging and boosting. This seems to call for irreducible, context-specific ethical judgment in assessing the appropriateness of the forms of paternalism that economists must actually wrestle with in going about their everyday business.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ross, Don] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Cape Town; University College Cork,"Ross, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Ross, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.;Ross, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland.",don.ross@uct.ac.za,,"Ross, Don/0000-0003-1813-3111",,,,,49,13,14,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

As such, in principle contract farming is a necessary condition for the structural transformation of developing economies to occur. Yet contract farming is far from monolithic, and the institution takes on a variety of forms. In this article, we describe how the institution of contract farming varies in cross-sectional data covering 1,200 households across six regions of Madagascar, half of which are growers in contract farming agreements covering a dozen different crops. In this setting, participation in contract fanning has been associated with increases in income, improvements in food security, and reductions in income variability. Given those presumed effects in this setting of participation in contract farming, we then look at the correlates in our data of participation in contract farming. as well as one's willingness to pay to participate in contract fanning as a grower in an attempt to better target policies aimed at encouraging participation in contract farming.","[Bellemare, Marc F.; Lim, Sunghun] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022",,National Institute of Food and Agriculture [Min-14-061],National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),Bellemare would like to thank the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for funding this work through grant Min-14-061-Smallholder Participation in Agricultural Value Chains: Evidence from Madagascar.,,85,43,48,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Using a mail survey of 767 Ohio Lake Erie recreational angler respondents and a choice experiment, this study provides the first empirical quantification of the economic impacts of HABs on U.S. recreational anglers. Our results demonstrate a significant and substantial willingness to pay by anglers for reduction in HABs, beyond the benefits associated with conventional water quality measures such as catch rates and water clarity. For instance, we find that anglers are willing to pay $8 to $10 more per trip for one less mile of boating through HABs en route to a fishing site. This finding suggests that explicit measures of HABs need to be collected and considered when valuing water quality in nutrient-rich bodies of water. We evaluate the welfare improvements resulting from several nutrient reduction policies, and find that anglers are willing to pay on average $40 to $60 per trip for a policy that cuts upstream phosphorus loadings by 40%. The majority of welfare gains for anglers result from improving the non-catchable component of the fishing experience, notably water clarity and HAB reduction, as opposed to better chances of angler success.","[Zhang, Wendong] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zhang, Wendong] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zhang, WD (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Zhang, WD (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wdzhang@iastate.edu,,"Sohngen, Brent/0000-0002-9094-160X",Lake Erie Commission; NOAA/Ohio Sea Grant Program,Lake Erie Commission; NOAA/Ohio Sea Grant Program,"Wendong Zhang is an assistant professor in the Department of Economics and Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University.

This paper examines the role of anchoring bias in self-reports of objective and subjective outcomes under recall. We use a unique panel-survey dataset of smallholder farmers from four countries in Central America collected over a period of three years. We exploit differences between recalled and concurrent responses to quantify the degree of mental anchoring in survey recall data. We assess whether respondents use their reported value for the most recent period as a cognitive heuristic when recalling the value from a previous period, while controlling for the value they reported earlier. The results show strong evidence of sizeable anchoring bias in self-reported retrospective indicators for both objective measures (income, wages, and working hours) and subjective measures (reports of happiness, health, stress, and well-being). We also generally observe a larger bias in response to negative changes for objective indicators and a larger bias in response to positive changes for subjective indicators.","[Godlonton, Susan] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Godlonton, Susan] Int Food Res Inst IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Hernandez, Manuel A.; Murphy, Mike] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Williams College; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hernandez, MA (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets.",,55,22,27,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In early 2013, RIN prices soared, causing the regulator to propose reducing future mandates. We estimate empirically the effect of three policy shocks that reduced the expected mandates in 2013. We find that the largest of these shocks decreased the value of the fuel industry's 2013 compliance obligation by $ 7 billion. We then study the effects of the shocks on commodity markets and the market value of publicly-traded biofuel firms. Results show that the burden of the mandate reductions fell primarily on advanced biofuel firms and commodity markets of the marginal compliance biofuel. We argue that the policy shocks reduced the incentive to invest in the technologies required to meet the future objectives of the RFS, and discuss alternative policy designs to address the problems that arose in 2013.","[Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lawell, C. -Y.

When firms could not pay according to worker's health preventative effort levels due to asymmetric information, they provide an incentive contract to cope with the moral hazard problem. We test the existence of ex ante moral hazard in the U.S. hog farms. Using a national employee survey data in 1995 and in 2000, we find that even though employers provide protective devices to reduce the negative effects of poor environmental conditions on employees' respiratory health, many employees do not wear the devices, which is consistent with the moral hazard behaviours. The probability of using a protective device is 10 per cent lower in the farms with an agency problem than in family farms without an agency problem, even after we control for medical insurance provision types. Reducing pollutants, providing protective devices and instilling the importance of using masks help to alleviate moral hazard incidences.","[Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xundong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yulong] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; Iowa State University,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuli.isu@gmail.com,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Yu, Li/0000-0003-0067-6548",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403303]; Innovation Research Program and Youth Talent Plan in Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP1604],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Research Program and Youth Talent Plan in Central University of Finance and Economics,"Many thanks go to seminar participants at Peking University, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and Beijing Normal University.

Processed food trade between Canada and the EU is one of the fastest growing markets, in spite of large trade restrictions due to high tariffs and egregious nontariff barriers (NTB). The processed food sector is characterized by firms which differ in size, productivity, produce differentiated products, and engage in monopolistic competition. We implement a four-region (Canada, the EU, the United States, and the Rest of the World) model of the processed food industry, incorporating these firm characteristics to study the effects of CETA. The results show Canadian and EU bilateral trade flows expand, the number of exporting firms rises, and net welfare in both these countries increases. Though CETA does not liberalize NTBs, we examine the impacts of a 40% cut in NTBs to highlight the benefits that would have accrued had CETA also covered NTBs. Under this scenario, the trade flows would have expanded significantly, and, more importantly, Canadian and EU welfare would have risen by 11.8- and 39.4-fold, respectively. Since CETA excludes the United States, the U.S. processed food industry loses due to greater competition in Canadian and the EU markets, and the net U.S. welfare declines.","[Devadoss, Stephen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Luckstead, Jeff] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Luckstead, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",stephen.devadoss@ttu.edu; jluckste@uark.edu,,,Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2016-11898854],Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),"We very much appreciate the valuable comments of the editor Sebastien Pouliot and an anonymous reviewer.

We analyze panel data from 309 smallholders in Benin covering the 2011 and 2013 harvest seasons. Results suggest that smallholders are driven to sell at harvest time for different reasons, depending on their motivation for storing. In households that report direct consumption as their primary goal for storing maize, liquidity constraints, not storage losses, reduce the amount they store. In contrast, households that store maize with the intention of selling it later in the year appear unaffected by liquidity constraints. Instead, these households store less when they expect to lose more during storage. These results suggest that policies to provide liquidity will be more helpful in motivating storage among consumption-oriented households. Households motivated to store for later sale will benefit from modern storage technologies that mitigate the operational costs associated with storage losses.","[Kadjo, Didier] ONYX, BP 650 Abidjan 17, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob; Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Abdoulaye, Tahirou] IITA, PMB 5320,Oyo Rd, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Baco, Mohamed N.] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Lab Soc Environm LaSEn, BP 27, Parakou, Benin",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); University of Parakou,"Kadjo, D (通讯作者)，ONYX, BP 650 Abidjan 17, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",kadjodid@gmail.com,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), under the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS 2 PICS 3); Norman E.

Using the case of sustainability labelling on coffee, we demonstrate various approaches to account for ANA based on the fixation count cut-offs, definitions for detecting ignored attributes, and methods for modelling ANA. Some of the sustainability attributes identified through eye-tracking measures as being 'visually ignored' were truly ignored, whereas in none of the tested approaches was price truly ignored. The adequacy of eye tracking as a visual ANA measure might thus depend on the type of attribute. Further, the study unveiled inconsistencies in identifying non-attenders using visual ANA and the coefficient of variation. Based on our results, we cannot conclude that eye tracking always adequately identifies ANA. However, we identified several major challenges that can assist in further optimising the use of eye tracking in the context of ANA.","[Van Loo, Ellen J.; Verbeke, Wim] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.; Seo, Han-Seok] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland",Ghent University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Stirling,"Van Loo, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.",ellen.vanloo@UGent.be,"Van Loo, Ellen J./A-9008-2012; Seo, Han-Seok/AAJ-3238-2021; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Van Loo, Ellen J./0000-0002-0162-1760; Seo, Han-Seok/0000-0001-9845-8199; Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",,,,,81,36,37,5,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

These policies often differ significantly from first-best policy prescriptions. Among the largest renewable energy mandates enacted to date is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates biofuel consumption far beyond what is feasible with current technology and infrastructure. We critically review the methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency to project near- and long-term compliance costs under the RFS, and draw lessons from the RFS experience to date that would improve the program's efficiency. The lessons are meant to inform both future RFS rulemaking and the design of future climate policies. We draw two lessons specific to the RFS. First, incorporate uncertainty into rulemaking; second, implement multi-year rules. Multi-year rulemaking allows for longer periods between major regulatory decisions and sends greater certainty to markets. We also provide two more general recommendations: tie waiver authority to compliance costs or include cost containment provisions, and fund research and development of new technologies directly rather than mandating them. Future technological advancement is uncertain, and mandating new technologies has proven to be largely ineffective to date, particularly in fuel markets.","[Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lawell, C-Y Cynthia Lin] Cornell Univ, Environm Energy & Resource Econ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Lade, GE (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Lade, GE (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",gelade@iastate.edu,"Lin Lawell, C.-Y.

Our data are generated from a contingent valuation survey of 599 owners of marginal land in southern Michigan. Employing a Bayesian framework and using these spatially explicit data, we estimate and compare non-spatial probit and spatial Durbin probit models to examine the presence of spatial dependence in land rental intentions. Results show that intentions to rent land for bioenergy crop production are spatially dependent. This spatial dependence arises both from the land supply intentions of nearby landowners and from spatial spillover effects of landowner characteristics and attitudes towards environmental amenities and the disamenities of land rental. We show that ignoring spatial dependence in the intentions of neighbouring landowners to participate in land rental markets for bioenergy feedstocks can lead to distortions that underestimate total effects. Our finding implies that studies of land use and crop supply should test for spatial interactions in order to make accurate inferences.","[Skevas, Theodoros] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Skevas, Ioannis] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Swinton, Scott M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Gottingen; Michigan State University,"Skevas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",skevast@missouri.edu,"SKEVAS, IOANNIS/AAB-5138-2019","SKEVAS, IOANNIS/0000-0003-4595-4396",,,,,50,22,23,5,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Using meta-regression analysis, the empirical results show that the reported impact of adopting agricultural innovation and technology rises significantly over time, notwithstanding a significant publication bias. Whether studies find significant impacts of adopting agricultural innovation and technology depends on the use of experimental research designs, parametric method, endogenous switching regression and region.

Crop insurance may change farm investments by reducing risks and providing subsidies. First, actuarially fair insurance reduces risks in crop production and marketing, holding the expected return constant. Second, insurance subsidies encourage farms to purchase crop insurance, which increases the expected return to insured risky crops. Farms also have many self-insurance mechanisms such as crop diversification or working off the farm. We derive conditions under which (1) unsubsidized and actuarially fair crop insurance or (2) insurance premium subsidies lead to more investment in a risky higher return crop. We then examine the role of self-insurance for these conditions. The impact of premium subsidies is decomposed into a direct profit effect and an indirect coverage effect. These effects are explained by substitutions between market insurance and self-insurance and between a risky crop and a safe crop. We discuss each effect as a combination of subsidy and risk effects. Numerical illustrations show that an insurance subsidy has a larger impact on risky crop investments compared to that of an input subsidy when farms are more risk-averse and have high costs of self-insurance. The framework provides a novel way to evaluate subsidized crop insurance programs.","[Yu, Jisang] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kansas State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Yu, JS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jisangyu@ksu.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011; Yu, Jisang/JOZ-5167-2023","Yu, Jisang/0000-0003-3936-1877",,,,,37,36,53,15,123,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Unfortunately, projected growth rates have fallen in recent years; this article examines the impact of this slowdown on the poor, particularly the rural poor. It first uses a global model to assess the impacts of lower productivity on key price and income variables. It then uses microsimulation models for almost 300,000 households to assess the impacts on their real incomes. Although poverty rates overall are projected to fall substantially, the poorest countries see the greatest slowdown in poverty reduction, with over 5% of their population projected to remain below the poverty line. In addition, poverty rates will remain alarmingly high in many countries. Overall, 38 million fewer people will leave extreme poverty compared to earlier projections. Farm households are at particular risk in middle-income countries, with over 1.5% more of the farming population remaining trapped in poverty than previously estimated. By 2030, average extreme poverty in rural areas is projected at about 7.5%, rather than 7.1% under the earlier growth projections. Clearly, a strong focus on policies for poverty reduction will be vital for eliminating poverty by 2030.","[Debucquet, David Laborde; Martin, Will] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Martin, W (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",w.martin@cgiar.org,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,19,14,14,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A recent policy change in California offers a unique opportunity to measure the economic repercussions of minimum space requirements for egg-laying hens. Using forecasting methods and structural break tests as applied to sixteen years of monthly data on egg production and input prices, we find that by July 2016, both egg production and the number of egg-laying hens were about 35% lower than they would have been in the absence of the new regulations. Out-of-state eggs were able to compensate for falling California production until around the time the new rules were implemented, at which point imports of eggs into California fell. For consumers, we estimate price impacts using panel structural break tests and difference-in-differences models as applied to five years of scanner data from the retail market for shell eggs in three California markets and three control markets. We find that the average price paid per dozen eggs was about 22% higher from December 2014 through September 2016 than it would have been in the absence of the hen housing restrictions. The price impact fell over time, from an initial impact of about 33% per dozen to about 9% over the last six months of the observed time horizon. These price increases correspond to welfare losses of at least $ 117 million for the three California markets over the observed time horizon. Our results suggest that because of the policy change, California consumers can expect to experience annual welfare losses of at least $ 25 million in future years from higher retail egg prices alone.","[Mullally, Conner] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Mullally, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",connerm@ufl.edu,,"Mullally, Conner/0000-0001-5551-332X",,,,,29,35,41,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The model has realized widespread adoption for a number of purposes. Inherent in the model are a number of assumptions. An important and potentially restrictive assumption is that the underlying asset price is log-normally distributed. Among the many diverse uses of the BS model, the model and underlying theory are used to derive measurements of the variance of expected (harvest-time) prices for use in rating revenue coverage in the federal crop insurance program. Revenue coverage currently accounts for about 80% of the total liability insured in the program. This liability frequently exceeds $100 billion and thus the accuracy of revenue premium rates is of vital importance. The use of the BS model by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) of the USDA has been the focus of recent criticisms of the program. Critics have argued in favor of retrospective measures of price variability that are based on historical price movements or have recommended other approaches to measuring price risk.

First, holding insurance coverage constant, premium subsidies directly increase expected profit, which encourages more acreage of insured crops (direct profit effect). Second, premium subsidies encourage farms to increase crop insurance coverage. With more insurance coverage, farms obtain more subsidies, and farm revenue becomes less variable as indemnities offset revenue shortfalls, so acreage of insured crops likely increases (indirect coverage effect). By exploiting exogenous policy changes and using approximately 180,000 county-crop-year observations, we estimate the sum of these two effects of premium subsidies on the pattern of U.S. acreage across seven major field crops. We estimate that a 10% increase in the premium subsidy causes a 0.43% increase in the acreage of a crop in a county holding the premium subsidy of its competing crop constant. Taking into account the small share of premium subsidies in expected crop revenue, this subsidy impact is analogous to an own-subsidy acreage elasticity of 1.24, which exceeds own-price acreage elasticity estimates in the literature. One explanation for the larger acreage response to premium subsidies is that insurance causes an indirect coverage effect in addition to a direct profit effect.","[Yu, Jisang] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Sumner, Daniel A.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr Issues Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kansas State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Yu, JS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jisangyu@ksu.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011; Yu, Jisang/JOZ-5167-2023","Yu, Jisang/0000-0003-3936-1877",,,,,50,60,77,6,88,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper considers two hypothetical scenarios: one revolving around a fallback to most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates and the other considering the additional effect of increased transaction costs in intraregional trade. Results from a computable general equilibrium model indicate that applying MFN tariff rates to U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade would lead to a 14.43% reduction in these trade flows, while a scenario also featuring higher transaction costs would bring an even larger reduction (21.25%). In both scenarios, almost every agricultural product experiences a reduction in bilateral trade, with U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico undergoing some of the largest proportionate decreases. Many sectors within North American agriculture would have lower output, including fruit and nuts, vegetables, oilseeds and vegetable oils, and processed foods in Canada; fruit, vegetables, and beef in Mexico; and poultry meat, pork, beef, and dairy products in the United States.","[Beckman, Jayson; Zahniser, Steven] ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW,Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zahniser, S (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW,Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",zahniser@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,37,1,2,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Farmers answered a detailed questionnaire designed to learn about losses during harvest and transport, processing and storage and which measures both complete losses and crop damage. The findings indicate that fewer than half of households report suffering losses conditional on growing each crop. Conditional on losses occurring, the loss averages between 5 and 12 per cent of the farmer's total harvest. Compared to nationally representative data that measure losses using a single survey question, this study documents a far greater percentage of farmers experiencing losses. We find that losses are concentrated in harvest and processing activities for groundnuts and maize; for soya, they are highest during processing.

While work within nutritional science suggests that stunting in early childhood is associated with low intakes of animal-sourced foods (ASFs), this topic has received little attention from economists. We attempt to redress this omission through an analysis of 130,432 children aged 6-23 months from 49 countries. We document distinctive patterns of ASF consumption among children in different regions. We find evidence of strong associations between stunting and a generic ASF consumption indicator, as well as dairy, meat/fish, and egg consumption indicators, and evidence that consuming multiple ASFs is more advantageous than any single ASF. We explore why ASF consumption is low but also so variable across countries. Non-tradable ASFs (fresh milk, eggs) are a very expensive source of calories in low-income countries and caloric prices of these foods are strongly associated with children's consumption patterns. Other demand-side factors are also important, but the strong influence of prices implies an important role for agricultural policies-in production, marketing and trade-to improve the accessibility and affordability of ASFs in poorer countries.","[Headey, Derek; Hirvonen, Kalle] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Hoddinott, John] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Cornell University,"Headey, D (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1112307]; CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the grant Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) Phase II [OPP1177007]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1177007, OPP1112307] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)(CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the grant Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) Phase II(CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This research was conducted under the Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (AReNA) project, supported by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Investment ID: OPP1112307) and the CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH).

We motivate our findings through the use of a conceptual model that emphasizes that the impact of cash and food transfers on dimensions of food consumption-both quantity and quality-will differ by the income level of the household and whether or not the food transfer is extra-marginal. Consistent with this model, households in localities randomized to receive the food basket experienced larger, positive impacts on measures of dietary diversity than those receiving the cash transfer. By contrast, households receiving cash were more likely to make bulk purchases of grains and spent more money on private transfers and debts.

A representative orange grower planting early-mid varieties for the processed market is featured in the case. The study assumes that an existing grove has become disease-infested to a degree that there is little, if any economic value in maintaining it. The grower is left with the choice to replant the grove or to convert the land to other uses. The replanting baseline model yields a 9.7% Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) and the Monte Carlo simulation shows that MIRR is equal or higher than the 7.5% hurdle rate around 81% times the model is simulated. The risk of managing an orange grove is higher than a decade ago mainly due to the presence of citrus greening, a disease that reduces yields and degrades fruit quality, causing variability in productivity and operating costs. Opportunities for growers include planting incentive programs implemented by both the government and major citrus processors and from policy changes such as the possibility of changes in depreciation of new investment for income tax purposes. Readers of this case study are expected to challenge the assumptions of the financial model and consider additional elements of risk and opportunities on their assessment of the potential orange grove investment.","[Trejo-Pech, Carlos J.

While there are a number of studies on this topic, they frame moral hazard in inputs use in a static model. However, when agricultural producers are forward-looking, they would make input allocation decisions realizing that their decisions would affect their future actual production history. This, in turn, affects the probability and size of future indemnity payments. Thus, moral hazard should be framed in a dynamic input use decision model. We first show theoretically that under certain feasible conditions, a static analysis always results in lower optimal input use when compared to a dynamic one with endogenous actual production history. This is because static models fail to recognize the role of actual production history. We then run numerical simulations using nitrogen application rates as a case study. We find that static models indicate significant reduction in nitrogen use compared to the no-insurance scenario, whereas the dynamic models with a role for actual production history indicate almost no reduction in applied nitrogen. The dynamic analysis not only suggests a near absence of moral hazard, but, for low coverage rates, it results in an optimal nitrogen rate higher than that under the no-insurance scenario. These findings illustrate the importance of recognizing the role of actual production history in mitigating moral hazard possibilities in crop insurance and the dynamic nature of moral hazard in crop insurance.","[Mieno, Taro; Walters, Cory G.; Fulginiti, Lilyan E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Mieno, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",tmieno2@unl.edu,,"Mieno, Taro/0000-0002-0614-0771","Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NEB-24-182, NEB-24-183, W4133]; Nebraska Research Initiative",Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Nebraska Research Initiative,"This work was supported by the Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch projects NEB-24-182 and NEB-24-183, and Multi-state Hatch project W4133.

One major pathway by which climatic variability is hypothesized to increase conflict is by decreasing food availability. However, limitations on food access at both the local and national levels in many developing African countries force most armed groups and communities to depend on locally-produced food. These actors are therefore likely to use violence to establish control over more food resources or be stationed where more food is available, suggesting that food abundance might also be driving conflict. The present study employs novel data on wheat and maize yields in Africa measured at the very local level to empirically evaluate this hypothesis on a highly disaggregated conflict indicator. To account for the endogenous relationship between conflict and food production, average local levels of drought are used as an instrument. The findings show that, contrary to previous expectations, conflict is driven by higher yields, on average, and not by scarcity.","[Koren, Ore] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koren, Ore] Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Dartmouth College,"Koren, O (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Koren, O (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ore.koren@dartmouth.edu,,,Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar Award from the United States Institute of Peace,Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar Award from the United States Institute of Peace,"Ore Koren is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, and a U.S. Foreign Policy and International Security Fellow at the Dickey Center for International Understanding, Dartmouth College.

In addition to mitigating the pollution externality of conventional energy, clean energy mandates have the goal of promoting research and development (R&D) investments in renewable energy technology. But how well do mandates perform as innovation incentives? To address this question, we develop a partial equilibrium model to examine the R&D incentives induced by a mandate, and compare this policy to two benchmark situations: laissez faire and a carbon tax. Innovation is stochastic and the model permits an endogenous number of multiple innovators. We present both analytical results and conclusions based on numerical simulations. We find that the optimal mandate is larger than it would be without the prospect of innovation, that neglecting the outlook for innovation significantly reduces welfare, and that the optimal mandate is more sensitive to assumptions about the innovation process than an optimal carbon tax. Furthermore, we find that mandates create relatively strong incentives for R&D investment in low-quality innovations, but relatively weak incentives to invest in high-quality innovations. We also rank policies by expected welfare. An optimal carbon tax has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate, and both have higher expected welfare than laissez faire. Moreover, in our endogenous innovation setting, a stronger result obtains: a simple carbon tax equal to the damage from pollution (unadjusted for the prospect of innovation) has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate.","[Clancy, Matthew S.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Clancy, MS (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",matthew.clancy@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,36,11,15,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We estimate welfare gains resulting from optimal management under uncertainty as well as a gradual stock externality that produces the dynamics of a large aquifer being slowly exhausted. This groundwater model imposes an important aspect of a depletable natural resource without the extreme assumption of complete exhaustion that is necessary in a traditional single cell (bathtub) model of groundwater extraction. Using dynamic programming, we incorporate and compare stochasticity for both an independent and identically distributed as well as a Markov chain process for annual rainfall. We find that the spatial depletion of the aquifer is significant to welfare gains for a parameterization of a section of the Ogallala Aquifer in Kansas, ranging from 2.9% to 3.01%, which is larger than those found previously over the region. Surprisingly, the inclusion of stochasticity in rainfall increases welfare gains only slightly.","[Merrill, Nathaniel H.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Guilfoos, Todd] Univ Rhode Isl, Environm & Nat Resource Econ Dept, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Rhode Island,"Merrill, NH (通讯作者)，US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",merrill.nathaniel@epa.gov,,,"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; ORD [ORD-015498]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1005053]; NIFA [811931, 1005053] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); ORD; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Although the information in this document has been funded in part by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it does not necessarily reflect the views of that agency, and no official endorsement should be inferred.

Using a newly expanded compilation of multifactor productivity (MFP) estimates and associated partial-factor productivity (PFP) measures, we examine changes in the pattern of U.S. agricultural productivity growth over the past century and more. Considering the evidence as a whole, we detect sizable and significant slowdowns in the rate of productivity growth in recent decades. U.S. multifactor productivity grew at an annual average rate of just 1.16% per year during 1990-2007 compared with 1.42% per year for the period 1910-2007. U.S. yields of major crops grew at an annual average rate of 1.17% per year for 1990-2009 compared with 1.81% per year for 1936-1990. More subtly, but with potentially profound implications, the relatively high rates of MFP growth during the third quarter of the century are an historical aberration relative to the long-run trend.","[Andersen, Matthew A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Alston, Julian M.; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Andersen, Matthew A.; Alston, Julian M.] InSTePP, Durham, NC 27707 USA; [Alston, Julian M.; Smith, Aaron] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA",University of Wyoming; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Andersen, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Andersen, MA (通讯作者)，InSTePP, Durham, NC 27707 USA.",mander60@uwyo.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341; Andersen, Matt/0000-0002-3937-8217","University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; University of California, Davis; University of Wyoming; USDA's Economic Research Service, Agricultural Research Service; CSREES National Research Initiative","University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; University of California, Davis(University of California System); University of Wyoming; USDA's Economic Research Service, Agricultural Research Service; CSREES National Research Initiative(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Matthew Andersen is an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wyoming.

To measure changes in the cost of reaching international standards of diet quality, we introduce a new cost of diet diversity index based on the lowest-cost way to include at least five different food groups as defined by the widely used minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) indicator and compare that to a Cost of Nutrient Adequacy indicator for the lowest-cost way to meet estimated average requirements of essential nutrients and dietary energy. We demonstrate application of both indexes using national average monthly prices from two very different sources: an agricultural market information system in Ghana (2009-14) and the data used for national consumer price indexes in Tanzania (2011-15). We find that the cost of diet diversity index for Ghana fluctuated seasonally and since mid-2010 rose about 10% per year faster than national inflation, due to rising relative prices for fruit, which also drove up the cost of nutrient adequacy. In Tanzania there were much smaller changes in total daily costs, but more adjustment in the mix of food groups used for the least-cost diet. These methods can show where and when nutritious diets are increasingly (un)affordable, and which nutritional criteria account for the change. These results are based on monthly national average prices, but the method is generalizable to other contexts for monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of changing food environments.","[Masters, William A.; Bai, Yan; Herforth, Anna; Coates, Jennifer C.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Sarpong, Daniel B.] Univ Ghana, Sch Agr, Accra, Ghana; [Sarpong, Daniel B.] Univ Ghana, Agr Econ, Accra, Ghana; [Mishili, Fulgence] Sokoine Univ Agr Tanzania, Agr Econ, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Kinabo, Joyce] Sokoine Univ Agr Tanzania, Human Nutr, Morogoro, Tanzania",Tufts University; University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Masters, WA (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,"McIntyre, Lauren/AAC-8416-2020; Sarpong, Daniel/P-9584-2019; Masters, William A./A-4796-2017","Masters, William A./0000-0002-4546-7291",,,,,43,50,55,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In this study, we show that irrigation districts alleviate that risk by deviating from the strict application of prior appropriation doctrine. As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water-intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007-14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought-sensitive, high-value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes.

However, for agricultural trade, few studies have considered the factors affecting export survival. This article identifies factors affecting the duration of fresh fruit and vegetable exports to the U.S. market, including U.S. sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) policy regulations. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, our preferred model with exporter binary variables indicates that changes in U.S. commodity prices and exporter gross domestic product have the largest impact, whereas U.S. production variability and exporter experience have the lowest impacts on the hazard rate of export duration. Second, SPS treatment requirements have persistent impacts on trade duration. Water treatment requirements quadruple the average hazard rate in the first year of a spell of service, and while the hazard rate does diminish over time, it is still nearly three times the average hazard rate, even after the fourth year of the spell of service. Similarly, a combination treatment of fumigation and cold treatment/refrigeration more than triples the average hazard rate in the first year of the spell of service, but this effect diminishes more quickly over time.","[Peterson, Everett B.; Grant, Jason H.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Rudi-Polloshka, Jeta] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Peterson, EB (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",petrsone@vt.edu,,,National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative [2014-67023-21816],National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative, project # 2014-67023-21816.

Because monitoring nutrient applications is difficult, regulators instead oversee NMP adoption. In this paper we examine whether having NMPs make hog farms more likely to adopt nutrient management practices. We estimate nutrient application and uptake rates to assess whether operations with NMPs are less likely to over-apply nutrients. Using an endogenous treatment effects model to control for potential confounding and selection bias, we find that NMPs are positively correlated with the adoption of nutrient management practices, as well as with the reduced application of excess nutrients.","[Sneeringer, Stacy; Key, Nigel] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Pon, Shirley] NMR Grp Inc, Somerville, MA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sneeringer, S (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",ssneeringer@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,29,2,4,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We construct a general dynamic dual model for U.S. agriculture that allows tests for full variability and strict fixity to be performed for each input as well as tests for functional form. We estimate the model using a generalised Box-Cox functional form. Most test results are robust to functional form, but test results of fixity are sensitive for two of four inputs. The generalised Leontief is found to be significantly preferred to the translog and normalised quadratic functional forms for the dynamic model. With this functional form, family labour exhibits strict fixity, while land, capital and hired labour exhibit quasifixity. The estimated adjustment rates for the three quasi-fixed inputs are 15, 27 and 47 per cent. Production uncertainty has limited impacts on aggregate investment decisions for quasi-fixed inputs. The insignificant elasticity between state-contingent outputs suggests that an ex post analysis conditional on the realised states of nature is appropriate.","[Yang, Sansi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shumway, C.

We study the case of subsidies on pulses in select Indian states and their impact on consumption and ultimately nutrition (protein intake). As a natural experiment, we use the introduction of pulses into India's Public Distribution System (PDS) where the variations in prices were brought about by the inclusion of pulses in the PDS in some states and not in others. Our difference in difference (DID) estimates show that change in the consumption of pulses because of their inclusion in the PDS, though statistically significant, was of a small order. The impact was not large enough to bring about any sizable difference in consumption of pulses or the total protein intake. The results withstand several robustness checks including randomized inference and triple differencing based on location and other consumer characteristics.","[Chakrabarti, Suman] IFPRI, PHN Div, New Delhi, India; [Kishore, Avinash] IFPRI, SAO, New Delhi, India; [Roy, Devesh] IFPRI, Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Roy, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",d.roy@cgiar.org,"Chakrabarti, Suman/AAY-1792-2021","Chakrabarti, Suman/0000-0002-5078-2173",,,,,43,25,27,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We conducted an intercept survey of flex motorists as they refueled in five U.S. states. We overcome the problem caused by sample prices favoring low-ethanol blends by augmenting revealed preference data with stated preference data. A sample-selection problem arises because motorists with high willingness to pay seek out the relatively few stations that sell high-ethanol blends. We use responses from two questions to inform sample selection. We find the average U.S. motorist requires a substantial discount to switch to high ethanol blends beyond the price that equates the cost per mile of driving.","[Pouliot, Sebastien] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Pouliot, Sebastien] Farmingdale State Coll, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA; [Liao, Kenneth A.] Farmingdale State Coll, Dept Econ, Farmingdale, NY USA; [Babcock, Bruce A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Iowa State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Farmingdale State Coll, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Farmingdale, NY 11735 USA.",pouliot@iastate.edu,,,"Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation [EPS-1101284]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project [1010309]; NIFA [1010309, 913628] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors acknowledge support from the Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University, the National Science Foundation under Grant Number EPS-1101284, and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project 1010309.",,30,2,4,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We demonstrate how, under FSMA, certain categories of suppliers will gain advantage over others. Growers and suppliers within the United States, and their buyers, are likely to gain relative to foreign producers and importers because FSMA imposes specific requirements for importers. Among fully regulated growers, large growers will benefit relative to small growers. Many producers have already adopted food-safety standards that closely resemble the FSMA rules, and the cost of implementing the FSMA requirements for these producers will be much lower than for other producers.","[Bovay, John] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr Issues Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Connecticut; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bovay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.bovay@uconn.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011",,USDA ERS Cooperative Agreement [58-4000-0-0047]; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,USDA ERS Cooperative Agreement; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,Generous research funding support was provided by the USDA ERS Cooperative Agreement No. 58-4000-0-0047 and the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics.,,28,14,18,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We develop a structural vector autoregression model of a commodity futures market and use it to explain two recent spikes in cotton prices. In doing so, we make two contributions to the literature on commodity price dynamics. First, we estimate the extent to which cotton price booms and busts can be attributed to comovement with other commodities. Finding such comovement would be necessary but would not be sufficient evidence to establish that broad-based financial speculation drives commodity prices. Second, after controlling for aggregate demand and comovement, we develop a new method to point identify shocks to precautionary demand for cotton separately from shocks to current supply and demand. To do so, we use differences in volatility across time implied by the rational expectations competitive storage model. We find limited evidence that financial speculation caused cotton prices to spike in 2008 or 2011. We conclude that the 2008 price spike was driven mostly by precautionary demand for cotton, and the 2011 spike was caused by a net supply shortfall.","[Janzen, Joseph P.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Carter, Colin A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Carter, Colin A.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Janzen, JP (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",joseph.janzen@montana.edu,,,"Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture [58-3000-9-0076]","Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This article is based on work supported by a Cooperative Agreement with the Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture under Project Number 58-3000-9-0076.

A popular narrative paints a picture whereby opioid overdoses among white, male, less-educated, rural workers have been caused by reduced economic opportunities borne by such people. In this article, we causally test the validity of this theory by using Bartik-type variables to explore the relationship between local economic conditions and county opioid overdose death rates. We add to the literature by exploring how both employment and wage growth in different types of industries are related to opioid overdose deaths for the population as a whole, as well as for rural (vs. urban), male (vs. female) and white (vs. black) populations. We find mixed evidence. Our results confirm that wage and employment growth in industries more likely to employ low-skill workers are important protective factors for rural, white males. However, we also find evidence that economic improvements in low-skill industries are just as important in protecting blacks and women against opioid overdoses, and for workers in metro counties. We also find evidence that employment growth in high-paying industries has led to increases in opioid overdoes rates.","[Betz, Michael R.; Jones, Lauren E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Betz, MR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",betz.40@osu.edu,"Betz, Michael/I-5430-2013; Jones, Lauren E/GQZ-4156-2022","Jones, Lauren E/0000-0002-6236-7874",National Institutes of Health [P2C-HD058484]; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's SEED grant,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's SEED grant,"This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant P2C-HD058484, distributed through the Ohio State University's Institute for Population Research.

Research on biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) has shown that the crop improves the vitamin A status of children who consume as little as 100 grams per day, and intensive promotion strategies improve dietary intakes of vitamin A in field experiments. However, little is known about OFSP adoption behavior, or about the role that nutrition information plays in promoting adoption and changing diet. We report evidence from similar randomized field experiments conducted in Mozambique and Uganda to promote OFSP. We further use causal mediation analysis to study impact pathways for adoption and dietary intakes. Despite different agronomic conditions and sweet potato cropping patterns across the two countries, the project had similar impacts, leading to adoption by 61% to 68% of farmers exposed to the project, and doubling vitamin A intakes in children. In both countries, two intervention models that differed in training intensity and cost had comparable impacts relative to the control group. The project increased the knowledge of key nutrition messages; however, added knowledge of nutrition messages appears to have minimally affected adoption, conditional on assumptions required for causal mediation analysis. Increased vitamin A intakes were largely explained by adoption and not by nutrition knowledge gained, though in Uganda a large share of impacts on vitamin A intakes cannot be explained by mediating variables. Similar impacts could likely have been achieved by reducing the scope of nutrition trainings.","[de Brauw, Alan; Gilligan, Daniel O.; Kumar, Neha] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Eozenou, Patrick] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Meenakshi, J.

While some research has found a correlation between food deserts and consumer outcomes, it is unclear whether food deserts truly affect consumer choices. In this article, we compare food prices in food deserts, defined as low-income, low-access census tracts, and nonfood deserts to observe whether and to what extent consumers face higher prices for a complete diet in food deserts. If a nutritionally complete diet costs significantly more in food deserts, resident consumers may be constrained from consuming healthier foods. We use store-level scanner data from a nationally representative sample and calculate a census-tract level Exact Price Index (EPI) based on a food basket defined by the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP). The EPI addresses potential biases from both product heterogeneity and variety availability. We find that the overall price impact of living in a food desert is small; low-access areas have only 3.5% higher EPI than high-access counterparts. However, consumers who are constrained to shop within their own census tracts face a much higher EPI than high-access counterparts (9.2%). The higher EPI primarily comes from lower variety availability in food deserts.","[Fan, Linlin] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Baylis, Kathy; Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL USA; [Ver Ploeg, Michele] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Mississippi State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Fan, LL (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",lfan3@illinois.edu,,"Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281",,,,,42,15,18,5,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach A survey data of five counties were analyzed with the two-stage ordinary least squares model. Findings Households renting-in land trended to plant more maize, and the more land was rented by a household the more maize was planted, while wheat acreage showed non-response to farmland renting-in. Practical implications Overall, the analysis suggests that policy makers should be prepared for different changing trends of grain crop acreage across the nation as farmland transfer continues. Future research should pay attention to the effect of farmland transfer on agricultural productivity and rural household income growth. Originality/value As the Chinese Government is promoting larger-scale and more mechanized farms as a way of protecting grain security, it is important to understand whether farmland renting-in will reduce planted grain acreage. This study provides empirical evidence showing the answer to that question may differ across different regions and depend on the particular grain crop in question.","[Liu, Ying; Tang, Zeng; Nan, Zhibiao] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ying; Tang, Zeng; Nan, Zhibiao] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenggang] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Nan, ZB (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Nan, ZB (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",zhibiao@lzu.edu.cn,"刘, 颖/HTN-4598-2023","刘, 颖/0000-0002-7565-8961",Chinese Center for Strategic Research of Grassland Agriculture Development (SRGAD),Chinese Center for Strategic Research of Grassland Agriculture Development (SRGAD),This work was funded by the Chinese Center for Strategic Research of Grassland Agriculture Development (SRGAD).,,81,19,19,14,88,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Some food waste analyses seem to treat household food waste as a mistake or careless decision; however, consumer decisions to waste also likely reflect trade-offs and economic incentives. These issues were explored in large surveys of U.S. food consumers using both within- and between-subject designs, where we study consumers' decisions to discard food in different scenarios that vary safety, price, and opportunity costs.

The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs.

We explore this question in the context of rural Ethiopia using a 2014 cross-sectional dataset indicating whether or not youth household members from a previous 2010 survey had migrated by 2014, and in which sector they worked in 2014. We estimate a household fixed effects model and exploit exogenous variation in the timing of land redistributions to overcome endogenous household decisions about how much land to bequeath to descendants. We find that larger expected land inheritances significantly lower the likelihood of long-distance permanent migration and of permanent migration to urban areas. Inheriting more land also leads to a significantly higher likelihood of employment in agriculture and a lower likelihood of employment in the non-agricultural sector. Conversely, the decision to attend school is unaffected. These results appear to be most heavily-driven by males and by the older half of our youth sample. We also find suggestive evidence that several mediating factors matter. Land inheritance is a much stronger predictor of rural-to-urban permanent migration and non-agriculturalsector employment in areas with less vibrant land markets, in relatively remote areas (those far from major urban centers), and in areas with lower soil quality. Overall, these results affirm the importance of push factors in dictating occupation and migration decisions in Ethiopia.","[Kosec, Katrina; Ghebru, Hosaena; Holtemeyer, Brian; Schmidt, Emily] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Mueller, Valerie] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Kosec, K (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",k.kosec@cgiar.org,,"Schmidt, Emily/0000-0003-0109-7687","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; IFPRI's Ethiopia Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); U.K. Department for International Development (DfID)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; IFPRI's Ethiopia Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.K. Department for International Development (DfID)","Katrina Kosec is a senior research fellow, Hosaena Ghebru is a research fellow, Brian Holtemeyer is a senior research assistant, and Emily Schmidt is a research fellow, all at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

Furthermore, inferences about occurrence of trade are poor, with estimated models suggesting far lower market integration than is true in the data-generating process.","[Lence, Sergio H.; Moschini, GianCarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Moschini, GianCarlo] Iowa State Univ, CARD, Ames, IA USA; [Santeramo, Fabio Gaetano] Univ Foggia, Foggia, Italy",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; University of Foggia,"Lence, SH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",shlence@iastate.edu,"SANTERAMO, Fabio Gaetano/P-5519-2019","SANTERAMO, Fabio Gaetano/0000-0002-9450-4618",,,,,36,20,20,6,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We also quantify heterogeneity among households along the wealth spectrum regarding their ability to adapt to evolving weather patterns. This approach yields two key findings. First, adverse weather history prompts households to devote more time to maize cultivation on their own farms, to the detriment of other, possibly more remunerative income sources. Households also reduce application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertilizer and improved maize varieties, in response to adverse weather history. Our results are robust to different clustering structures and falsification tests aimed at ruling out alternative explanations to observed trends. Second, we find that, by maintaining a more diversified income structure, wealthier households are better able to adapt to adverse weather history. Consequently, adverse changes in past weather may be regressive in nature, creating a climate-induced poverty trap that locks poor smallholder households into low-value maize cultivation from season to season. This finding suggests that developing more weather-resilient maize varieties and promoting smallholder livelihood diversification strategies may help mitigate the effects of adverse weather on the most vulnerable households.","[Sesmero, Juan; Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cook, Aaron] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Sesmero, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsesmero@purdue.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2014-51130-22492]; Purdue Research Foundation; Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; USAID/Malawi; USAID's Environment, Growth, and Technology Division","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Purdue Research Foundation; Department for International Development (DFID)/Malawi; USAID/Malawi(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID's Environment, Growth, and Technology Division(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This study received support from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Grant no. 2014-51130-22492, and the Purdue Research Foundation.

The package includes improved techniques, improved inputs, and a guaranteed market for the crop. Relying on crop-cut measures and farmers' own assessments, we find that full package led to an average 14% higher yields. Implementation of the Wheat Initiative was successful in making certified seed and fertilizer accessible to farmers and increasing their uptake, though only 61% of the intervention group adopted row planting and few farmers received marketing assistance. The measured yield difference may underestimate the true yield difference associated with the technology because of incomplete adoption of the recommended practices by intervention farmers and adoption of some practices by control farmers.","[Abate, Gashaw Tadesse] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bernard, Tanguy; de Brauw, Alan; Minot, Nicholas] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Bernard, Tanguy] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, F-33600 Pessac, France",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org,,"Minot, Nicholas/0000-0001-9657-0427; Bernard, Tanguy/0000-0003-2554-0217","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; CGIAR Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); CGIAR Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","This article was carried out as part of the Research for Ethiopia's Agricultural Policy (REAP) project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the REAP project is designed to provide analytical support to the Ethiopian ATA.

The analysis develops supply functions of irrigable land from a water resource model for 282 river basins and applies them within a global economy-wide model. The analysis reveals two key findings. First, explicitly representing irrigated land has a small impact on global food, bioenergy and deforestation outcomes. This is because this modification allows irrigated and rainfed land to expand in different proportions, which counters the effect of rising marginal costs for the expansion of irrigated land. Second, changes in water availability have small impacts on global food prices, bioenergy production, land use change and the overall economy, even with large-scale (c. 150 exajoules) bioenergy production, due in part to endogenous irrigation and storage responses. However, representing water scarcity and changes in water availability can be important regionally, with relatively arid areas and/or areas with rapidly growing populations fully exhausting our estimated maximum irrigation capacity that allows for improved irrigation efficiency, lining of canals to limit water loss, and expanding storage to fully capture average annual water flows.","[Winchester, Niven; Ledvina, Kirby; Strzepek, Kenneth; Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-439h, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Strzepek, Kenneth] Univ Boulder Colorado, Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO USA; [Reilly, John M.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Winchester, N (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-439h, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",niven@mit.edu,,"Winchester, Niven/0000-0003-2703-4596; Ledvina, Kirby/0000-0003-1025-2212",BP; Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,BP; Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,"The authors wish to thank Rosemary Albinson, Bo Chen, Andrew Cockerill, Jo Howes, Fabio Montemurro, James Primrose and Cameron Rennie for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using Huang and Stoll's (1997) model of liquidity costs, we estimate whether changes to liquidity costs are driven by its adverse selection, inventory, or order processing components. Commodity index fund roll activity reduces the asymmetric information cost component of liquidity cost due to an increased proportion of noninformation-based trading, but the inventory cost component increases as (mostly long only) commodity index funds sell their nearby positions and buy the first deferred contractraising liquidity providers' risk of building a position. The sum of these two effects is that liquidity costs remain low during index fund roll periods, averaging one tick (0.25 cents). On USDA report release days, we find that informed traders raise the asymmetric information component of liquidity costs in the first hour after release, but the inventory cost component is reduced due to the increase in volume. Similar to index fund roll activity, liquidity costs on USDA report release days remain low, averaging one tick. Our findings that liquidity costs are minimally changed during USDA report releases and commodity index fund roll periods is consistent with other recent research on liquidity costs, but we show that what drives liquidity costs differs substantially depending on the circumstances surrounding daily trading.","[Shang, Quanbiao; Mallory, Mindy; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Mallory, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mallorym@illinois.edu,,,Office of Futures and Options Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project [ILLU-470-363],Office of Futures and Options Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project,The authors would like to acknowledge support of the Office of Futures and Options Research and U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project ILLU-470-363.

A novel sequential primal-dual estimation routine to calculate TFP change is proposed, using a multi-output input distance function in the first stage, followed by a cost minimization routine in the second stage. TFP change is estimated as the direct sum of the estimates of technical change, technical efficiency change, allocative efficiency change, input price effects, changes in output markup, and changes in returns to scale in each state. The validity of the proposed methodology is supported by the remarkable overlap and high correlation of our annual estimates of TFP change with the USDA's measures of change in TFP by state. Although technical change tends to be the largest contributor to productivity change, it bears a low and statistically insignificant correlation with TFP change on an annual basis, whereas annual changes in the markup effect and returns to scale are highly and significantly correlated with TFP changes. This is the first study to find a slowdown of technical progress in the U.S. farm sector in the 1990s and 2000s, and technical regress during the farm crisis of the 1980s. While technical efficiency shows a positive overall trend, allocative efficiency shows a negative overall trend, and their combined effect (i.e., the overall cost efficiency) slows down TFP growth. The policy recommendations from previous studies on the drivers of TFP should be revised in light of these findings.","[Plastina, Alejandro; Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Int Agr Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Plastina, A (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,"Plastina, Alejandro/AFU-1119-2022","Plastina, Alejandro/0000-0001-7333-5459",,,,,46,18,19,1,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The article appeals to a simple model to frame the relationship between migration and the probability that a reallocation of land in the village will occur in the following year. Empirically, the article first demonstrates that a village leader's support for an administrative land reallocation carries with it the risk of losing a future election. Exploiting election timing and village heterogeneity in lineage group composition, the article identifies the effect of reallocation risk on migration decisions. In response to an expected land reallocation in the following year, the probability that a rural resident migrates out of the county declines by 2.4 percentage points, which accounts for 15% of the annual share of village residents, aged 16 to 50, who worked as migrants during the period.

A supplementary empirical analysis, based on data from the Philippine crop insurance market, illustrates how sources of advantageous selection can be identified econometrically.","[He, Juan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Rejesus, Roderick; Zheng, Xiaoyong] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] IRRI, Social Sci Div, Laguna, Philippines; [Yorobe, Jose, Jr.] Univ Philippines, Laguna, Philippines",Huazhong Agricultural University; North Carolina State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Zheng, XY (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA.",xzheng@ncsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71703048]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [2662017QD011]; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects [NC02442, NC02598]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; US Department of Agriculture Hatch Projects,"Jose Yorobe is in the Social Sciences Division, IRRI, and also the University of the Philippines, Laguna, Philippines.

Using DNA fingerprinting through Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified different cultivars in farmers fields. We also used this information to remove possible bias in the adoption model that could have resulted from a misclassification of improved varieties (IVs). As a result, we found that farmers substantially overestimate their use of IVs and there are important differences in the determinants of adoption between farmer self-identification and DNA fingerprinting. This finding implies that the incorporation of DNA fingerprinting in IV adoption studies is important to ensure the accuracy of future agricultural economic research and the relevance of subsequent policy recommendations.","[Floro, Victorino O.] Georgetown Univ, Global Human Dev Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Labarta, Ricardo A.; Martinez, Jose M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Becerra Lopez-Lavalle, Luis A.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Agrobiodivers Res Area Cassava Program, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Martinez, Jose M.] Univ Valle, Dept Econ, Cali, Colombia; [Ovalle, Tatiana M.] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Cassava Genet Program, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia",Georgetown University; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Universidad del Valle; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Floro, VO (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Global Human Dev Program, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",vof2@georgetown.edu,"Martinez, Jose Maria/JYQ-1053-2024; Labarta, Ricardo/HMU-9249-2023; Lopez-Lavalle, Luis Augusto Becerra/H-4678-2019","Martinez, Jose Maria/0000-0003-4464-2374; Labarta, Ricardo/0000-0003-3517-8768; Lopez-Lavalle, Luis Augusto Becerra/0000-0003-3520-2270; Floro IV, Victorino/0000-0003-4949-3590",CGIAR Research Program on Roots Tubers and Bananas; Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University,CGIAR Research Program on Roots Tubers and Bananas(CGIAR); Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University,"Victorino Floro IV is a CIAT Visiting Researcher from the Global Human Development Program at Georgetown University, USA.

Schultz introduced the idea of the productivity residual to agricultural economics (1956). Schultz's main message was that growth in conventional inputs accounted for little of the observed growth in agricultural output, and that there was work to be done by agricultural economists to understand and ultimately eliminate this unexplained residual called productivity. Thus was launched the economics of agricultural productivity as a sub-field within agricultural economics, along with the economics of agricultural R&D and innovation and related government policy. Much progress has been made in the decades since. Still, critical issues remain unresolved. This matters because agricultural innovation and productivity matter, and so do the related policies that rest to some extent on our established understanding of the economic relationships. In this paper I review some unsettled issues related to economic models and measures applied to agricultural R&D and productivity, and some unfinished business in terms of economic and policy questions that are not yet well answered. Before doing that, I present some evidence on agricultural productivity and why it matters. Next, with a nod to factology, I present available productivity measures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) Center, and compare them in the context of translog cost function models. In subsequent sections I use these and other data to develop new evidence related to two contentious questions: (a) Do farmers benefit from public agricultural R&D?

Second, it validates the self-reported ANA behaviour across both approaches. Third, it explores the concordance of stated methods with that of the inferred method. Results show that WTP estimates from serial-level data differ from those from choice task-level data.

It contributes to the literature by providing additional broad support for the hypothesis that low rates of fertilizer use and improved seed variety adoption can be attributed to the fact that the SSA landscape is heterogeneous, so fertilizer and improved seed are not always advantageous, especially when considering the potentially high cost to farmers of obtaining fertilizer and improved seed. The analysis finds a synergy between nitrogen fertilizer and improved seed varieties. While the benefits of nitrogen tend to increase overtime without improved seed varieties and the benefits of improved seed varieties tend to decrease overtime without nitrogen, combining the two provides more sustained productivity benefits. Therefore, securing both nitrogen use and improved seed variety adoption is important for promoting sustained maize productivity increases across much of SSA. The research also contributes to the literature by using a methodology for calculating willingness to pay bounds that assess the importance of farmers' risk tolerances as a barrier to fertilizer use or improved seed variety adoption.","[Hurley, Terrance] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Ruttan Hall 231,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Koo, Jawoo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, IFPRI HEADQUARTERS, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689,CMC Rd, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Hurley, T (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Ruttan Hall 231,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",tmh@umn.edu,"Koo, Jawoo/HNR-9802-2023; Koo, Jawoo/F-9397-2010","Koo, Jawoo/0000-0003-3424-9229; Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; University of Minnesota; International Food Policy Research Institute; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center; Agricultural Experimentation Station [MIN-14-034],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center; Agricultural Experimentation Station,"This article was prepared for the HarvestChoice project with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the University of Minnesota, the International Food Policy Research Institute, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, and Agricultural Experimentation Station Project No. MIN-14-034.",,43,11,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

At the same time, there are proposals to strengthen the enforcement of existing immigration laws. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium approach to examine the impact of removing undocumented workers from the California agricultural labor market, and to infer whether there is evidence of shortages using individual-worker data. We find evidence that is consistent with a persistent shortage in some sub-sectors of the California farm labor market. Further, we conduct counter-factual policy simulations over a range of possible policy alternatives, and find that removing 50% all undocumented farm workers from the state would lead to an increase in wages of over 22%.","[Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Richards, TJ (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",tri-chards@asu.edu,,"Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",,,,,40,36,42,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

These equations are used to estimate the prices of the post-harvest contracts based on new supply estimates. Each estimate can be compared with a corresponding futures price, i.e. the market forecast. The differences help discern the market expectations about the expected demand for the new crop relative to historical experience, which can help support outlook analyses. We find that in recent years, a 100 million bushel change in the expected supply of corn results in about a 6 cent per bushel negative change in the price of December corn.

Despite this, relatively little research has analyzed nutrition differences across rural and urban populations, or across gradients of rural remoteness. In this article, we study these differences in sub-Saharan Africa by linking spatial data on travel times to urban centers with 20,000 or more people as our measure of remoteness to Demographic Health Survey data covering 74,398 children from 10,900 communities in 23 countries. We find that children in rural communities have much worse linear growth and dietary outcomes than urban children, but that children in more remote rural communities face only a small nutritional penalty compared to children from less remote communities. Moreover, the harmful effects of remoteness and rural living largely disappear once we control for education, wealth, and social/infrastructural services. This implies that the key nutritional disadvantages faced by rural populations stem chiefly from social and economic poverty.

In this paper we analyze the evolution of food retail by building a store choice equilibrium model and providing an illustrated discussion. The patterns in retail in any given time and place of different types of stores (such as traditional shops, supermarkets, and online e-commerce) depend on two main factors. The first are consumers' characteristics such as income, tastes, and travel costs of going to different stores and/or shipping costs if purchasing online. The second are the stores' cost structures, which include item costs from upstream producers, the costs of procurement supply chains (beyond the cost of the item) for perishable items, and the costs of in-store storage. We show under what conditions in equilibrium the different retail types exist and which can become dominant, and what types of goods (dry packaged foods versus perishables) are distributed by what type of retailers.","[Lu, Liang] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Michigan State University,"Lu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",llu@uidaho.edu,"Lu, Liang/AAK-1069-2021",,,,,,36,36,38,7,108,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

These are regions where economic despair seems to have taken hold for generations and which face numerous other impediments to economic prosperity, such as opioid abuse. Better understanding these linkages can lead to policy solutions to help the most disadvantaged places break the cycle of economic despair. Using county-level data, we begin by estimating a series of models that allow us to understand the drivers of local labor force participation. We also consider how these drivers may differ between rural and urban areas. We then analyze how levels of participation in the labor force are related to other measures of economic distress. We find that there is significant variation in the drivers of rural and urban labor force participation; however, much of the variation can be explained by known factors. Yet, our results also suggest that there remains some portion of the lower levels of labor force participation in West Virginia and Appalachia that cannot be explained by other factors. Since it appears that labor force participation is important to explaining higher levels of employment growth in rural areas, for persistently distressed regions, finding ways to increase labor force participation may be a critical step toward increasing economic prosperity.","[Stephens, Heather M.] West Virginia Univ, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Deskins, John] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Stephens, HM (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Resource Econ & Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",heather.stephens@mail.wvu.edu,,"Stephens, Heather/0000-0003-3472-216X",,,,,42,8,13,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Using the framework of variable profit functions and household level data, we study econometrically the wage impacts on crop agriculture. Rising wages are associated with decreasing crop output, other things being equal. Crop prices would need to increase by 80% in the short run to offset the effect of an agricultural wage increase, or by 140% in the short run to offset rural non-farm wage increases as well. However, because non-land farm assets respond positively to the non-farm wage, in the medium term this increase is reduced to 74%. During the period of 1999/00-2007/08, growth in non-land farm assets, the labour force, education and technology has easily compensated for the wage increase, and probably also for the accelerating wage growth. Focusing on growing these shifter variables is a much better policy option than raising prices that would come at the expense of consumers or taxpayers.","[Binswanger, Hans P.] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Singh, Sudhir K.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Pretoria; The World Bank,"Singh, SK (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ssingh12@worldbank.org,"singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023","singh, sudhir/0000-0001-5267-665X",,,,,39,11,11,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The periods having the strongest impact on Polish agricultural markets were the integration with the EU, the global crisis in 2008, and problems in the EU zone. The prices of analysed agricultural commodities differed in various EU countries. The prices of wheat increased most in France, Hungary and Lithuania.

A two-stage least squares (2SLS) multivariate Tobit regression model with random effects was applied. We find that impacts of drinking water conditions on off-farm labour supply may be greater for women than men but depends on the specific family role or family structure. A strong within-gender effect exists in households. For example, daughters are not sensitive to water access nor water quality, but householder's spouses are sensitive to water access, and daughters-in-law are sensitive to water quality. Our findings suggest that infrastructure development in improved access to safe water has contributed positively to reductions in traditional gender biases, evening the playing field between daughters, daughters-in-law, mothers and mothers-in-law. We also find that water the infrastructure program may actually encourage off-farm labour mobility, reducing the supply of agricultural labour and the share of household labour on the farm. Thus, a broader approach to water policy should also include public investment in achieving greater labour efficiency and productivity.","[Zhou, Li] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Cornell University,"Zhou, L (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhouli@njau.edu.cn,,"ZHOU, LI/0000-0001-8942-1976","Chinese National Social Science Foundation [13ZD160]; 'Qing Lan Project' - 'Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China","Chinese National Social Science Foundation; 'Qing Lan Project' - 'Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China","The work was supported by the Chinese National Social Science Foundation (project number: 13&ZD160) and the 'Qing Lan Project', 'A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)', 'China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University' in China.",,25,4,4,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Yet no one has looked at the opportunity cost of and the various trade-offs involved in participating in contract farming. I look at the relationship between participation in contract farming and income from (i) livestock, (ii) labor markets, (iii) nonfarm businesses, and (iv) agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming and (v) unearned income. Using data from Madagascar, I find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 79% decrease in how much income per capita the average household derives from labor markets and a 47% decrease in how much income per capita it derives from nonfarm businesses, but also with a 51% increase in how much income per capita the average household derives from agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming, possibly due to technological spillovers. Thus, even though contract farming has been shown to improve welfare in multiple ways in this context, it looks as though those gains come at the cost of an agricultural involution on the part of participating households, who seem to turn away from non-agricultural activities. This has important implications for structural transformation narratives.","[Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022",,National Institute of Food and Agriculture [MIN-14-061],National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),I am grateful to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for funding this work through grant MIN-14-061-Smallholder Participation in Agricultural Value Chains: Evidence from Madagascar.

While pecuniary economic incentives are the standard prescription for open-access market failures arising from such resources, non-pecuniary behavioral approaches (e.g., nudges) are also effective in some cases. Yet non-pecuniary instruments have not previously been evaluated for managing pesticide resistance. I empirically evaluate the performance of such an intervention to manage pest resistance to genetically engineered Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency permits sale of Bt seed conditional on seed producers compelling customers to plant mandated levels of non-Bt refuge to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. Because of compliance challenges, the Bt seed producer Monsanto piloted a social marketing program to promote refuge in 17 North Carolina counties in 2013-2014. Using 2013-2016 sales data, I use difference-in-differences, fractional regression, discrete changes-in-changes, and matched differences econometric models to identify the average treatment effect of the program on refuge planting. Results suggest that if it had covered all corn growers in North Carolina, the intervention would have led the average grower to plant between 2.6% (preferred estimate) and 5.8% more refuge in 2014 compared to the counterfactual.

The conceptual model posits substitution relations between water stress metrics and soil quality, as well as a soil-conditioned threshold water stress level beyond which soil cannot buffer crop yields. The model implies that yield-yield dependence should vary as growing conditions vary. In comparison with intermediate growing conditions, yield-yield dependence should strengthen when growing conditions are either very good or very poor. County yield data strongly support substitution between soil and benign water availability levels, but complementarity between soil and beneficial heat variables. Our estimated model provides qualified support for the hypothesis that better land is more resilient to water stress. We estimate a pseudo-copula that nests the Gaussian copula, finding strong evidence of left tail dependence among yields. Our formal model and empirical findings corroborate others' concerns about the appropriateness of current USDA rate-setting methodologies, which posit constant state-conditional rank correlations, implicitly assumed by use of the Gaussian copula. An application to aggregate crop yield rate setting suggests that current methods underprice area yield and whole farm premiums. Applying our empirical model to medium-range weather projections under a climate change scenario for the Northern Great Plains, we infer that systemic yield correlations will increase in future years.","[Du, Xiaodong] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Feng, Hongli] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Arora, Gaurav] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, Social Sci Div, Delhi, India",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",hennes64@msu.edu,"Feng, Hongli/A-1662-2013","Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145; Arora, Gaurav/0000-0002-8072-2382",,,,,43,6,7,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Facing fiscal constraints and growing enrolments, school systems in developing countries often supplement their teaching staff by hiring contract teachers. However, there is limited evidence on how the effectiveness of these teachers compares to that of civil service teachers. We use a dataset from rural primary schools in western China to estimate the causal effect of contract teachers on student achievement and find that gains in student scores on standardised examinations in mathematics and Chinese are less in classes taught by contract teachers than in classes taught by civil service teachers. The results demonstrate that China's education system needs to focus on producing high-quality teachers to improve the quality of schooling in its rural education system. The findings imply that educators in developing countries should not only seek to hire increasingly more civil service teachers in rural schools, but they should also identify ways of improving the quality of contract teachers. If efforts to improve teaching can succeed, rural students can learn more, earn higher incomes and contribute more to the productivity of the overall economy.","[Lei, Wang; Li, Mengjie] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Siqi; Sun, Yonglei] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Sylvia, Sean] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Postdoctoral Sci Res Workstat, Postal Savings Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Enyan] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Postdoctoral Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mo, Di; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Rural Educ Act Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Renmin University of China; Stanford University","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, mengjie/GRS-3931-2022",,111 Project; Ministry of Education of the P.R.

Design/methodology/approach An equilibrium displacement model of livestock products is combined with an inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) to deduce hypothesis about the effects of expected price and feed costs, weather, and supply and demand shifters on herd size. Dynamics are incorporated using the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models originally proposed by Nerlove (1956). The hypotheses are tested using both the structural equations implied by the model, and the reduced form. Findings Results suggest livestock inventories in IMAR in general are more responsive to weather conditions than to economic conditions. This is especially true for cattle and sheep, where isolated 1 percent changes in weather variables, namely precipitation and radiation, were found to have a much larger effect on inventory than isolated 1 percent changes in expected price and forage costs. The effects of the weather variables, moreover, were found to be different for goats than for cattle and sheep, with goat numbers decreasing with improvements in weather, and cattle and sheep numbers increasing. This suggests herders respond to poor weather in part by substituting goats for cattle and/or sheep. Price was found to have a negative effect on cattle inventory, and no effect on sheep and goat inventory. Forage costs were found to have a positive effect on cattle and sheep inventories, and no effect on goat inventory. These results suggest policies to protect grassland by controlling inventory levels must be designed carefully if they are to be effective. Originality/value The paper makes a methodological contribution in that the livestock inventory relation proposed by Rucker et al. (1984) is extended to include supply and demand shifters for livestock products in a partial-equilibrium setting where the industry in question is a net exporter of livestock products. The paper makes an empirical contribution in that additional evidence is provided on the role that price plays in inventory behavior.","[Ge, Wei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wei; Kinnucan, Henry] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Ge, W (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",wzg0015@auburn.edu,"li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023; Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224",,,,,18,3,4,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We match granted patents between 2000 and 2011 to administrative databases of firms and workers housed at the U.S. Census Bureau. We use inventor information in addition to the patent assignee firm name to improve on previous efforts linking patents to firms. The triangulated database allows us to maximize match rates and provide validation for a large fraction of matches. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms. Although manufacturing firms are more likely to patent than firms in other sectors, we find that most patenting firms are in the services and wholesale sectors. These new data are a product of collaboration within the U.S. Department of Commerce, between the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.","[Graham, Smart J.

Because of this, transit networks evolve with the growth of the metropolis and this entails changes in the network's accessibility. This study aims to explore the changes in accessibility following major transit network expansions in the Gwangju metropolitan area. Accessibility based on time distance was calculated for three different transit provision stages. The global accessibility measure indicates that the construction of subway line 1 would improve the transit accessibility significantly, but that of subway line 2 would not have as much of an impact as the former. The spatial distribution of the changes in accessibility appear to convey a similar message. Further, we propose two local rank-based accessibility measures to capture the spatial variation in benefits derived over different stages. Our findings agree with neither the criticism of the current subway line 1, whose modal share has remained quite low since inception nor the expectations from the planned subway line 2. This may be due to the limitations of our definition of accessibility; however, one can also infer that the under-utilization of subway line 1 hindered the realization of the accessibility impacts.","[Kim, Hyun] Univ Tennessee, Dept Geog, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Lee, Keumsook] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Park, Jong Soo] Sungshin Womens Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Song, Yena] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Sungshin Women's University; Sungshin Women's University; Chonnam National University,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",hkim56@utk.edu; kslee@sungshin.ac.kr; jpark@sungshin.ac.kr; Y.Song@chonnam.ac.kr,"Song, Yena/GXW-1441-2022","Song, Yena/0000-0002-0861-1397",Chonnam National University [2015-0607],Chonnam National University,"This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University (grant reference 2015-0607).

The particular complications that are involved in investigating these relationships in the health care sector may explain the dearth of research. We examine three invasive cardiac services: diagnostic angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. We document the relationship between the adoption by hospitals of these three invasive cardiac services and the characteristics of the hospitals, their markets, and the interactions among them, from 1997 to 2014. The results show that the probability of hospitals' adopting a new cardiac service depends on competition in two distinct ways: (1) hospitals are substantially more likely to adopt an invasive cardiac service if competitor hospitals also adopt new services; and (2) hospitals are less likely to adopt a new service if a larger fraction of the nearby population already has geographic access to the service at a nearby hospital. The first effect is stronger, leading to the net effect that hospitals duplicate rather than expand access to care. In addition, for-profit hospitals are considerably more likely to adopt these cardiac services than are either nonprofit or government-owned hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals in high-penetration, for-profit markets are also more likely to adopt them relative to other nonprofits. These results suggest that factors other than medical need-such as a medical arms race-partially explain technological adoption.","[Horwitz, Jill R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Horwitz, Jill R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, NBER, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hsuan, Charleen] Penn State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, 604B Ford Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Nichols, Austin] Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; ABT Associates,"Horwitz, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Horwitz, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, NBER, 385 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",horwitz@law.ucla.edu; chsuan@psu.edu; Austin_Nichols@abtassoc.com,,"Hsuan, Charleen/0000-0001-8720-2323",UCLA School of Law,UCLA School of Law,Funding was provided by UCLA School of Law.,,49,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We estimate these effects using new panel data on church attendance and clergy employment for 13 European countries from 1960 to 2000, spanning the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Using nuns per capita as a proxy for service provision, we estimate fertility effects on the order of 300 to 400 children per nun. Moreover, nuns outperform priests as a predictor of fertility, suggesting that changes in childrearing costs dominate changes in theology and norms. Reduced church attendance also predicts fertility decline, but only for Catholics, not for Protestants.

In the raw data, inspectors new to inspected restaurants tend to report 27 percent more violations than repeat inspectors. After ruling out regulatory capture and endogenous rotation of inspectors as potential explanations, we find that the gap between new and repeat inspections is best explained by the following two effects: first, restaurants target compliance in response to the heterogeneous stringency and preferences of inspectors; second, inspectors pay greater attention in a first visit than in subsequent visits. After controlling for the heterogeneous criteria of inspectors, we find that a new inspector reports 13-18 percent more violations than noted in the second visit of the previous inspector, likely because of a higher level of attention. Counterfactual simulations highlight the importance of inspectors' training and rotation in regulatory outcomes.","[Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lee, Jungmin] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Seoul National University (SNU),"Jin, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"lee, jungmin/IXW-6580-2023",,Alfred P.

Because NBA rookies who participate in games gain NBA experience that likely improves their long-term performance, decisions of NBA teams about whether to let rookies play provide a useful context for investigating this potential agency problem. We develop a model that identifies when owners will choose to leave coaches with discretion over rookie participation decisions and shows that, in the presence of such discretion, coaches facing a higher termination risk can be expected to use rookies less often. Testing our model using NBA data, we find evidence that is consistent with the predictions of our model.","[Cohen, Alma] Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cohen, Alma; Sasson, Roy] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Cohen, Alma] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levy, Nadav] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Herzliyya, Israel",Harvard University; Tel Aviv University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Reichman University,"Cohen, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Cohen, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Cohen, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Cohen, Alma/R-9690-2019",,,,,,31,3,3,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this paper, we draw upon interviews to interpret site selection consultants as intermediaries between a demand for locations emanating from MNEs and a supply of locations provided by national and subnational territories. We show how this intermediary role extends beyond the economizing on search costs and into the rarely appreciated market-creating and value adding opportunities offered by location. We also show how the knowledge mobilised by consultants is quintessentially geographical. Paradoxically, it is the geographical nature of the knowledge mobilised by site selection consultants that presents frictions to the professionalisation and globalisation of the industry despite its seminal role in promoting the mobility of economic activities. In conclusion, we explore elements of a future research agenda centred on the mediated nature of MNE location decisions.","[Phelps, Nicholas A.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Wood, Andrew M.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, 857 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of London; University College London; University of Kentucky,"Phelps, NA (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",n.phelps@ucl.ac.uk,,"Wood, Andrew/0000-0001-5931-2621","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","Bartlett School of Planning, University College London; College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky","The authors are grateful for research funding for this research provided by the Bartlett School of Planning, University College London and the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Kentucky.",,68,18,19,3,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Understanding the diffusion of carsharing services,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carsharing; Adoption; Technology diffusion; Shared-mobility,CAR OWNERSHIP; PREFERENCE; SYSTEMS; IMPACTS,"Carsharing (CS) has gained attention as a measure to reduce vehicle ownership, motivate multimodal mobility and cut greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Some municipalities have adopted specific regulations to support adoption of CS. Initial studies, reflecting outcomes from early adopters, have confirmed the expected effects of CS on reduced car ownership and GHG emissions associated with mobility. This study addresses three questions: a) are early adopters sensitive to one-way vs. two-way carsharing? b) do early and late adopters have different household characteristics? and c) can outcomes associated with early adopters be projected onto later adopters? Our study is based on a 2013 survey of residents in 110 apartment buildings in Metro Vancouver, Canada. 2011 responses were analyzed for possible differentiating factors for early adopters at the household level. We find that early adopters (24% of respondents) have more wage-earners per household, live with fewer older family members in neighbourhoods with better CS access and own fewer cars. Among non-CS membership holders (76% of respondents), roughly one-third stated they would never choose CS. The rest expressed interest in joining if CS accessibility was improved and usage/membership fees were lowered. These households are dissimilar to early adopters; they are more likely to live with elderly family members and to own automobile(s) while less likely to have multiple wage earners in their households. The specific characteristics and circumstances of early CS adopters mean that as CS memberships expand, the past patterns of vehicle utilization, car-shedding, vehicle kilometres travelled shifts, and greenhouse gas reductions may not be replicated. Further investigations are required before concluding that the long-term effects of CS services align with observed benefits to date.","[Namazu, Michiko; Dowlatabadi, Hadi] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, AERL Bldg 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [MacKenzie, Don] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 121B, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zerriffi, Hisham] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of British Columbia,"Namazu, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, AERL Bldg 429-2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",michiko.namazu@alumni.ubc.ca; dwhm@uw.edu; hisham.zerriffi@ubc.ca; hadi.d@ubc.ca,,"Zerriffi, Hisham/0000-0003-4890-2575","Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation [SES-1463492]; Canada Research Chairs; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Metro Vancouver; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation from Japan; Carnegie Mellon's Climate and Energy Decision Making Center (CEDM) under US National Science Foundation; Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",We would like to acknowledge support from Metro Vancouver for this study.

In this paper, we test that intuition within a generalized Polya urn model. We find that if we assume constant feedbacks, in the long run, higher quality products dominate the market regardless of initial market shares, contradicting the common wisdom. However, when we allow for variable feedbacks, initial advantages persist almost indefinitely. Thus, the choice of whether to rush to market or focus on quality depends on market characteristics such as whether the positive feedbacks result from more consistent returns to scale or from more variable social influences.","[Lamberson, P.

A seller has an object for sale and can reach buyers only through intermediaries. Intermediaries can either mediate the transaction by buying and resellingthe merchant modeor refer buyers to the seller for a feethe referral mode. When the seller has a strong bargaining position and can condition the asking price to the intermediaries' business model choice, all intermediaries specialize in agency. The seller's and intermediaries' joint profits equal the seller's profits when he has access to all buyers. When the seller does not have such bargaining power, the level of the referral fee and the degree of competition among intermediaries determine the business mode adoption. A hybrid agency-merchant mode may be adopted in equilibrium. Banning the referral mode can decrease welfare because the merchant mode is associated with additional allocative distortions due to asymmetric information.","[Condorelli, Daniele; Galeotti, Andrea] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester, Essex, England; [Galeotti, Andrea] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Fiesole, Italy; [Skreta, Vasiliki] UT Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX USA; [Skreta, Vasiliki] UCL, London, England",University of Essex; European University Institute; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of London; University College London,"Condorelli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester, Essex, England.",d.condorelli@gmail.com; andrea.galeotti@eui.eu; vskreta@gmail.com,,", Vasiliki/0000-0001-5045-5327",,,,,41,7,7,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Our results support hypotheses drawn from the corporate-finance and ownership literatures; entrepreneurs preferred the corporation for the largest firms and for firms vulnerable to holdup. In 1919, Spain introduced a new legal form, a limited company combining attributes of the corporation and the partnership. This Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (SRL) displaced both corporations and partnerships, and was especially popular for small and medium-sized firms whose owners were unrelated.

Insurance policies reflect this possibility through so-called subrogation provisions that give insurers the right to step into the shoes of insureds and to bring suits against injurers. In a basic case, the optimal subrogation provisions involve full retention by the insurer of the proceeds from a successful suit and the pursuit of all positive expected value suits. This eliminates litigation risks for insureds and results in lower premiums-financed by the litigation income of insurers, including from suits that insureds would not otherwise have brought. Moreover, optimal subrogation provisions are characterized in the presence of moral hazard, administrative costs, and non-monetary losses, and it is demonstrated that optimal provisions entail sharing litigation proceeds with insureds in the first two cases but not when losses are non-monetary.","[Polinsky, A.

At the same time, past efforts to study the drivers or effects of competition laws have been hampered by the lack of systematic measures of these laws across a wide range of years or countries. In this paper, we draw on new data on the evolution of competition laws to create a novel Competition Law Index (the CLI) that measures the stringency of competition regulation from 1889 to 2010. We then employ the CLI to examine trends in the intensity of competition regulation over time and across key countries. We also use our data to create several alternative indexes of competition law that may be appropriate for specific research applications. In doing so, we hope to demonstrate how the CLI can facilitate new empirical research on comparative and international competition law.","[Bradford, Anu] Columbia Law Sch, Law & Int Org, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Bradford, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, Law & Int Org, New York, NY 10027 USA.",abradf@law.columbia.edu; adamchil-ton@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1228453, 1228483]; Columbia Law School; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1228453, 1228483] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Columbia Law School; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We gratefully acknowledge the outstanding work of over seventy Columbia Law School students who helped us retrieve, review, and process the data used in the construction of the CLI.

Using data on juvenile deportation proceedings, we examine how tougher immigration enforcement might have influenced judicial rulings on these cases and, ultimately, these youths' ability to stay in the country. We find that the average increase in immigration enforcement over that period is associated with a 15% reduction in the share of juvenile cases ending with permission to stay. The result underscores the importance of the immigration policy context in which courts operate on their rulings, even if immigration law is within the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Given the gravity of the circumstances these children are escaping, further attention to how the piecemeal approach to immigration enforcement might impact the protection of their humanitarian rights is warranted.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Puttitanun, Thitima] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",California State University System; San Diego State University; Kasetsart University,"Amuedo-Dorantes, C (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; fecotmp@ku.ac.th,"Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X",,,,,51,7,10,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The implication of this rational design model of commercial contracting behavior is that courts should pay close attention to the plain or ordinary meaning of the language in a standardized term and interpret observed changes in terminology as embodying new meaning that varies from the original formulation. Using a study of the sovereign bond market, we examine the rational design model as applied to standard-form contracting. In NML v. Argentina, federal courts in New York attached great weight to the precise phrasing of the boilerplate contract terms at issue. The industry promptly condemned the decision for endorsing a supposedly erroneous interpretation of a variant of a hoary boilerplate clause. Utilizing data on how contracting practices responded to the courts' decisions, we ask whether the market response indicates that parties in fact intended the variations in their standard contract language to embody different meanings The data support a model of evolution of boilerplate language that is closer to random mutation rather than rational design.","[Choi, Stephen J.] NYU, Law Sch, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Gulati, Mitu] Duke Law Sch, Durham, NC USA; [Scott, Robert E.] Columbia Univ, Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York University; Duke University; Columbia University,"Scott, RE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rscott@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

In the case of the German cement cartel that operated over 1991-2002, the primary source of noncartel supply was imports from Eastern European cement manufacturers. Testimonies in a private enforcement case have claimed that the cartel sought to control imports by sharing rents with intermediaries in order to discourage them from sourcing foreign supply. Specifically, cartel members would allow an intermediary to issue the invoice for a transaction and charge a fee even though the output went directly from the cartel member's plant to the customer. We investigate this claim by first developing a theory of collusive pricing that takes account of the option of bribing intermediaries. The theory predicts that the cement cartel members are more likely to share rents with an intermediary when the nearest Eastern European plant is closer and there is more Eastern European capacity outside of the control of the cartel. Estimating a logit model that predicts when a cartel member sells through an intermediary, the empirical analysis supports both predictions.","[Harrington, Joseph E., Jr.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hueschelrath, Kai] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business & Econ, Blechhammer 9, D-98574 Schmalkalden, Germany; [Laitenberger, Ulrich] Telecom ParisTech, Dept Sci Sociales & Econ, 46 Rue Barrault, F-75013 Paris, France; [Hueschelrath, Kai; Laitenberger, Ulrich] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",University of Pennsylvania; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Harrington, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",harrij@wharton.upenn.edu; hueschel@hs-sm.de; laitenberger@enst.fr,,"Laitenberger, Ulrich/0000-0002-7009-0190","State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); CDC","State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); CDC(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","The project was financially supported by the State Government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, through the research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK).

In both models, bargaining failure is driven by asymmetric information. The difference between the models lies in the bargaining structure: In the signaling game, the informed party makes the final offer, while in the screening game the uninformed party makes the final offer. We conduct experiments for both models under a common set of parameter values, allowing only the identity of the party making the final offer to change. We find the anomalous behavior to be more common in the signaling game, but the frequency of this behavior diminishes in the later rounds of the experiment. Across both games, in the later rounds of the experiment over 90% of offers are consistent with the theory. Having the right to make the offer raises a player's expected payoffs, but by much less than is predicted by theory.

The results also suggest that this spatial spillover effect cannot be tied exclusively to the distribution of natural suitability characteristics. Rather, the likelihood of an area being converted to agriculture appears to reflect the dynamic socio-economic conditions of a location's surroundings.

We then propose a hierarchical production function and estimate its parameters in each period. We find that coordination costs fell over time, so that hiring one's first associate leveraged a partner's skill by about 30% more in 1992 than 1977. We find also that changes in lawyers' hierarchical organization account for about two-third of the increase in earnings inequality among lawyers in the upper tail, but much less of the increase between lawyers in the upper tail and other lawyers.

Prior to the riot, the Greenwood community was among the wealthiest African-American neighborhoods in the state. Residents of Greenwood had successfully developed their own business infrastructure, and by the early 1920s the neighborhood was rapidly expanding and flourishing economically. The attack by white citizens on a flourishing black neighborhood not only resulted in mass casualties, but it destroyed nearly all of the African-American-owned businesses and churches, as well as many residential properties. The economic prosperity of Greenwood was literally obliterated overnight. The Greenwood community was perceived as a threat to white hegemony. The riot and its aftermath served to effectively impede African-American prosperity. The city of Tulsa provided very little monetary assistance following the event. Greenwood residents attempted to rebuild following the destruction, but the community never regained the same economic standing. We argue that the Tulsa riot of 1921 was one of many examples of racial violence during the early part of the 20(th) century that had long-lasting economic and social legacies for African Americans.","[Messer, Chris M.] Colorado State Univ Pueblo, Sociol, Pueblo, CO 81001 USA; [Shriver, Thomas E.] North Carolina State Univ, Sociol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Adams, Alison E.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Colorado State University; North Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Messer, CM (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ Pueblo, Sociol, Pueblo, CO 81001 USA.",chris.messer@csupueblo.edu; tom_shriver@ncsu.edu; alison.adams@ufl.edu,,"Shriver, Thomas/0000-0002-4868-6449",,,,,67,17,42,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Even if a strong nondelegation doctrine provides legislators an incentive to draft narrow statutes, they would have many reasons to persist in broad delegations, and it is not clear whether the doctrinal incentives predominate. Here, I examine the relationship between the nondelegation doctrine and lawmaking behavior at the state level using several novel datasets, including a collection of state session laws between 1990 and 2010, and a comprehensive survey of state nondelegation judicial decisions over the last 20 years. Contrary to the common assumption, I find that the robustness of the nondelegation doctrine appears essentially unrelated to legislative drafting practices. This pattern suggests the limited extent to which judicial doctrine can control legislative practices; it also suggests a revived nondelegation doctrine at the federal level is unlikely to effectuate the hopes of proponents or the fears of opponents.","[Stiglitz, Edward H.] Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Stiglitz, EH (通讯作者)，Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",js2758@cornell.edu,,,,,,,46,11,12,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In Philadelphia, defendants randomly receive bail magistrates who differ widely in their propensity to set bail at affordable levels. Using magistrate leniency as an instrument, I find that pretrial detention leads to a 13% increase in the likelihood of being convicted, an effect largely explained by an increase in guilty pleas among defendants who otherwise would have been acquitted or had their charges dropped. I find also that pretrial detention leads to a 42% increase in the length of the incarceration sentence and a 41% increase in the amount of nonbail court fees owed. This latter finding contributes to a growing literature on fines-and-fees in criminal justice, and suggests that the use of money bail contributes to a poverty-trap: those who are unable to pay bail wind up accruing more court debt.","[Stevenson, Megan T.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Stevenson, MT (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",msteven@gmu.edu,,"Stevenson, Megan/0000-0002-3518-8985",,,,,42,63,92,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Under asymmetric learning about workers' productivity, the market takes job assignments (or promotions) as a signal of quality and bids up the wages of a promoted worker, leading to inefficiently few promotions (Waldman, M. 1984. Job Assignments, Signalling, and Efficiency 15 RAND Journal of Economics 255-67). Breakup fees can mitigate such inefficiencies by shielding the firm from labor-market competition, but they reduce turnover efficiency when there are firm-specific matching gains. We show that it is optimal to use breakup fees if and only if the difference between the worker's expected productivity in the pre- and post-promotion jobs is small. Also, the relationship between the optimality of breakup fees and the importance of firm-specific human capital is more nuanced than what the extant literature may suggest.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Michigan State University; University of Essex; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arijit@msu.edu,,"Vasconcelos, Luis/0000-0002-2952-5674",,,,,53,10,10,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Emerging work about the interaction between MNEs, space and place also highlights the need for finer scale research to understand the strategy and knowledge exchange of MNEs, which remains limited to this point. To address this need for fine-grained analyses of firm co-location behaviour, this paper uses point-level data to test hypotheses about the co-location behaviour of three types of manufacturing firms in the Detroit metropolitan area. Variations in this behaviour highlight that foreign rather than domestic firms may be the primary source of knowledge spillovers, which speaks to the internationalisation of manufacturing activity in the region over time. New domestic standalone ventures appear to have been crowded out from cluster activities, suggesting a policy opportunity to integrate new standalone ventures into collaborative ventures with other firms in the region.","[Mack, Elizabeth A.; Credit, Kevin] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Suandi, Matthew] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Mack, EA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",emack@msu.edu,,"Credit, Kevin/0000-0002-3320-4670",,,,,52,2,3,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Applying stochastic actor-oriented models on longitudinal relational data from a mature cluster in a medium-tech industry, we show that triadic closure and geographical proximity increase the probability of tie creation but does not influence tie persistence. Cognitive proximity is positively correlated to tie persistence but firms create ties to cognitively proximate firms only if they are loosely connected through common third partners.

However, the feasibility of introducing large numbers of fuel cell electric trucks, buses, and vans to the roads remains unclear, in part because the MHDV market is highly diverse in terms of vehicle size, use, and vocation. This paper attempts to answer the question: will hydrogen fuel cell MHDVs be space or weight constrained given their range of operation? The results suggest that most MHDVs have sufficient space for hydrogen storage tanks under the side rails, behind the cab, and/or under the chassis to accommodate 90 percent of each vehicle segment's daily range of operation, although identifying a standard size, design, and placement of these components may be challenging.","[Kast, James; Morrison, Geoffrey; Gangloff, John J., Jr.] Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Vijayagopal, Ram] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Marcinkoski, Jason] US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Morrison, Geoffrey] Cadmus Grp Inc, Waltham, MA USA",Oak Ridge Associated Universities; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE),"Kast, J (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, US DOE, Fuel Cell Technol Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA.",jamesfkast@gmail.com; gmorrison101@gmail.com; jgang87@gmail.com; rvijayagopal@anl.gov; jason.marcinkoski@gmail.com,,,"Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary; DOE [DE-AC05-060R23100]; Argonne, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Argonne, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported in part by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Secretary administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) for the DOE.

The objective of this paper was to compare the predictive ability of univariate and bivariate models, in terms of forecasting US gross national product (GNP) growth at different forecasting horizons, with the bivariate models containing information on a measure of economic uncertainty. Based on point and density forecast accuracy measures, as well as on equal predictive ability (EPA) and superior predictive ability (SPA) tests, we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of different model specifications over the quarterly period of 1919:Q2 until 2014:Q4. We find that the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index should improve the accuracy of US GNP growth forecasts in bivariate models. We also find that the EPU exhibits similar forecasting ability to the term spread and outperforms other uncertainty measures such as the volatility index and geopolitical risk in predicting US recessions. While the Markov switching time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model yields the lowest values for the root mean squared error in most cases, we observe relatively low values for the log predictive density score, when using the Bayesian vector regression model with stochastic volatility. More importantly, our results highlight the importance of uncertainty in forecasting US GNP growth rates.","[Segnon, Mawuli] Univ Munster, Ctr Quantitat Econ, Munster, Germany; [Segnon, Mawuli] Mark E AG, Hagen, Germany; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska Omaha, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Munster; University of Pretoria; European University Institute; IPAG Business School; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Omaha; Loughborough University,"Segnon, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Quantitat Econ, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",segnon@uni-muenster.de,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,67,19,19,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Using handcollected original data on the background characteristics of EU judges and on competition judgments by the General Court between 1989 and 2015, we test the extent to which the legal origins of judges bear a statistically significant effect on case outcomes and that the rapporteur plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. In particular, if a rapporteur comes from a country whose administrative law has a strong French influence, the decision is more likely to favor the Commission than if he is from any other EU country.

This paper seeks to explore how subnational regions, and their composite institutions, function in coordinating - or not - to attract multinational investment and facilitate collocation advantages. Using case study analysis of two subnational regions within a single advanced economy, we illustrate the potential variation and implications of subnational institutional structure, posturing and engagement with FDI.

These concerns have led many city and state legislatures to pass laws requiring drivers to provide a minimum amount of distance between their vehicle and cyclists when passing them on roadways. Many believe these laws are ineffective in reducing the number of bicyclist fatalities because they are difficult for police to enforce, contain loopholes, and the minimum distance required is inadequate. This paper tests this claim empirically using data on 18,534 bicyclist fatalities from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and a differences-in-differences approach, in a negative binomial model, to identify the effect of minimum distance passing laws on bicyclist fatalities. The analysis fails to find a significant effect of enacting a minimum distance passing law on the number of cyclist fatalities after controlling for differences in weather, demographics, bicycling commuter rates, state level traffic, and time variation.","[Nehiba, Cody] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Nehiba, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",cnehiba@uci.edu,,,"University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation; University of California, Irvine Department of Economics","University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation; University of California, Irvine Department of Economics","The author thanks Kevin Roth, David Brownstone, Jan Brueckner, Linda Cohen, Paulina Oliva, Doug Houston, and seminar participants at UC Irvine, ITEA Annual Conference, and S4C Colloquium for their helpful suggestions.

This paper analyzes CSR activity using quasi-experimental variation created by Section 135 of India's Companies Act of 2013, which requires (on a comply-or-explain basis) that firms satisfying specific size or profit thresholds spend a minimum of 2% of their net profit on CSR. We examine effects on CSR spending and related outcomes, as well as exploring broader theoretical implications. Our analysis uses financial statement data on Indian firms from the Prowess database, along with hand-collected data from firms' disclosures of CSR activity. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find significant increases in CSR activity among firms affected by Section 135, especially along the extensive margin (i.e. in the fraction of firms engaging in CSR spending). The fraction of firms subject to Section 135 that engage in advertising expenditures declines, consistent with substitution between advertising and CSR. For a subset of large firms, we hand-collect comprehensive CSR data and find that while firms initially spending less than 2% increased their CSR activity, large firms initially spending more than 2% reduced their CSR expenditures after Section 135 came into effect. We explore various explanations for this presumably unintended consequence of Section 135, and also seek to derive some wider implications of this analysis for understanding the role of CSR.

J,"Lichtenberg, FR",,,,"Lichtenberg, Frank R.",,,THE IMPACT OF NEW DRUG LAUNCHES ON LIFE-YEARS LOST IN 2015 FROM 19 TYPES OF CANCER IN 36 COUNTRIES,JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,cancer; mortality; pharmaceuticals; innovation; cost-effectiveness,PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION; MORTALITY; BURDEN,"This study employs a two-way fixed effects research design to measure the mortality impact and cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: It analyzes the correlation across 36 countries between the relative mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs previously launched in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence. The sample size (both in terms of number of observations and population covered) of this study is considerably larger than the sample sizes of previous studies; a new and improved method of analyzing the lag structure of the relationship between drug launches and life-years lost is used; and a larger set of measures of the burden of cancer is analyzed. The number of DALYs and life-years lost are unrelated to drug launches 0-4 years earlier. This is not surprising, since utilization of a drug tends to be quite low during the first few post-launch years. Moreover, there is likely to be a lag of several years between utilization of a drug and its impact on mortality. However, mortality is significantly inversely related to the number of drug launches at least 5 years earlier, especially to drug launches 5-9 years earlier. One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs due to cancer at that site by 5.8%;; one additional drug launched during 1982-2005 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 DALYs by about 2.6%. Lower quality (or effectiveness) of earlier vintage drugs may account for their smaller estimated effect. We estimate that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the number of cancer DALYs in 2015 by about 23.0%, and that, in the absence of new drug launches during 1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs in 2015. Also, the nine countries with the largest number of drug launches during 1982-2010 are estimated to have had 14% fewer cancer DALYs (controlling for incidence) in 2015 than the nine countries with the smallest number of drug launches during 1982-2010. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained in 2015 from drugs launched during 2006-2010 range between $1,635 (life-years gained at all ages) and $2,820 (life-years gained before age 65). These estimates are similar to those obtained in previous country-specific studies of Belgium, Canada, and Mexico, and are well below the estimate obtained in one study of Switzerland. Mortality in 2015 is strongly inversely related to the number of drug launches in 2006-2010. If the relationship between mortality in 2020 and the number of drug launches in 2011-2015 is similar, drug launches 5-9 years earlier will reduce mortality even more (by 9.9%) between 2015 and 2020 than they did (by 8.4%) between 2010 and 2015.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,Incyte Corporation; National Institute on Aging [R24 AG048059],Incyte Corporation; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),Financial support for this research was provided by Incyte Corporation and by the National Institute on Aging (Grant R24 AG048059).,,44,9,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Individual, household, and geographic characteristics served as predictors of nudge approval, and the count of significant predictors as measures of controversy. Less high approval rates of nudges in Denmark and Hungary were reflected in higher controversy about System 1 nudges, whereas the United Kingdom and Italy were marked by higher controversy about System 2 nudges, despite high approval rates. High-controversy nudges tended to be associated with current public policy concerns, for example, meat consumption.

For identification, we use two sets of triple-difference tests that control for country-level omitted variables using fixed effects for each country-year pair. First, using cross-sectional differences across industries in a country, we find that the effect of EPLs on privatization is disproportionately greater in industries in which separation rates and relocation rates are higher.

One such cybersecurity issue relates to data integrity attacks. This paper focuses on the power industry, where the forecasting processes rely heavily on the quality of the data. Data integrity attacks are expected to harm the performances of forecasting systems, which will have a major impact on both the financial bottom line of power companies and the resilience of power grids. This paper reveals the effect of data integrity attacks on the accuracy of four representative load forecasting models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy interaction regression). We begin by simulating some data integrity attacks through the random injection of some multipliers that follow a normal or uniform distribution into the load series. Then, the four aforementioned load forecasting models are used to generate one-year-ahead ex post point forecasts in order to provide a comparison of their forecast errors. The results show that the support vector regression model is most robust, followed closely by the multiple linear regression model, while the fuzzy interaction regression model is the least robust of the four. Nevertheless, all four models fail to provide satisfying forecasts when the scale of the data integrity attacks becomes large. This presents a serious challenge to both load forecasters and the broader forecasting community: the generation of accurate forecasts under data integrity attacks. We construct our case study using the publicly-available data from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012. At the end, we also offer an overview of potential research topics for future studies.

Here, we lay out a two-region, two-social class model for thinking about this issue, and we exploit its implications to propose a novel account of the present-day divide between North and South of Italy. To illustrate, we document that it also arose because of the region-specific policies selected between 1861 and 1911 by the elite of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which unified Italy in 1861. While pre-unitary revenues from land property taxes and railway diffusion were shaped by each region's farming productivity but not by its political relevance for the Piedmontese elite, the opposite was true for the post-unitary ones. Moreover, tax distortions and the severity of all the other extractive policies are related to the growing post-unitary divide in culture and literacy, but not to the gap in the manufacturing industry value added. These two sets of results imply that extraction has neither eased the formation of a unitary market nor favored industrialization. Reassuringly, we reach similar conclusions when we consider region fixed effects and time dummies whether interacted or not with the structural conditions differentiating the two blocks of regions in 1861, i.e., inclusiveness of political institutions, land ownership fragmentation, and inputs. Crucially, our framework sheds light on the incentives of other groups dominating political and economic unions, e.g., Germany within the post-crisis EU. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Using detailed district-to-district migration data from the 2001 Census of India, the article highlights the role of state borders as significant impediments to internal mobility. The analysis finds that average migration between neighboring districts in the same state is at least 50% larger than neighboring districts on different sides of a state border, even after accounting for linguistic differences. Although the impact of state borders differs by education, age and reason for migration, it is always large and significant. The article suggests that inter-state mobility is inhibited by state-level entitlement schemes, ranging from access to subsidized goods through the public distribution system to the bias for states' own residents in access to tertiary education and public sector employment.","[Kone, Zovanga L.] Univ Oxford, COMPAS, 58 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England; [Liu, Maggie Y.; Mattoo, Aaditya; Ozden, Caglar; Sharma, Siddharth] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Liu, Maggie Y.] Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",University of Oxford; The World Bank; Smith College,"Ozden, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cozden@worldbank.org,,,Knowledge for Change Program; Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change Program; Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program of the World Bank,"We would like to thank the Data Dissemination Unit, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India for preparing the data tables from the 2001 Census under a special administrative agreement with the World Bank.

Operating much like raises, such events have the potential to alter intra-household power dynamics. Using Australian panel data, we estimate couple-specific fixed effects models and find that female promotion has the strongest association with housework time allocation adjustments. These adjustments are in part attributable to concurrent changes in paid work time, but gender power relations also appear to play a role. Further results indicate that households holding more liberal gender role attitudes are more likely to adjust their housework time allocations after female promotion events. Power dynamics cannot, however, explain all the results. Supporting the sociological theory that partners may do gender, we find that in households with more traditional gender role attitudes, his housework time falls while hers rises when he is terminated.","[Foster, Gigi] Univ New South Wales, Dept Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] IZA, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Stratton, Leslie S.] LCC, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Econ, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，IZA, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，LCC, 301 W Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",gigi.foster@unsw.edu.au; lsstratt@vcu.edu,"Foster, Gigi/D-5297-2019","Foster, Gigi/0000-0002-1588-0202",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

And do local or nonlocal establishment founders create most novelty in a region? We develop a theoretical framework that focuses on the roles different agents play in regional transformation. We then apply this framework, using Swedish matched employer-employee data, to determine how novel the activities of new establishments are to a region. Incumbents mainly reinforce a region's current specialization: incumbent's growth, decline, and industry switching further align them with the rest of the local economy. The unrelated diversification required for structural change mostly originates via new establishments, especially via those with nonlocal roots. Interestingly, although entrepreneurs often introduce novel activities to a local economy, when they do so, their ventures have higher failure rates compared to new subsidiaries of existing firms. Consequently, new subsidiaries manage to create longer-lasting change in regions.","[Neffke, Frank; Hartog, Matte] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neffke, Frank; Hartog, Matte; Henning, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch Stavanger Ctr Innovat, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Henning, Martin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Business Adm, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Harvard University; Lund University; Utrecht University; Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Gothenburg,"Neffke, F (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Neffke, F (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",frank_neffke@hks.harvard.edu; Matte_Hartog@hks.harvard.edu; r.a.boschma@uu.nl; martin.henning@handels.gu.se,,"Neffke, Frank/0000-0002-3924-6636",MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth & Financial Inclusion; European Union Seventh Framework Programme [SSH-CT-2010-266959],MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth & Financial Inclusion; European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"We are grateful to Karl-Johan Lundquist for his support throughout the project and to Sarah Hopkinson and Daniel Kang for their excellent research assistance.

We analyze a regulatory change implemented by the SEC in 2007 by examining its effect on a key market metric, the bid-ask spread, an investor cost, and find that the regulatory shift, indeed, disadvantages investors. We link the implementation of this change to a shift in the volume of trades from a low-cost venue to a high-cost venue. We argue that this outcome is predicted by the incentives of the venues, non-profit stock exchanges owned by different types of members. The less-volatile, lower-cost New York Stock Exchange was owned by underwriters and included a specialist system that is less vulnerable to HFT tactics that can disadvantage investors.

In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct.","[Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ponzetto, Giacomo A.

This paper studies the association between district-level transportation infrastructure and district-average child nutrition outcomes in Nepal. We combine two rounds of nationally representative data on child growth from the 2006 and 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys with district level information on roads and road quality. We estimate a dose-response function for height-for-age and weight for-height z-scores. Results suggest that roads and road quality matter for short- and long-term nutrition outcomes for children under five years of age. Using a spatial econometric model we also observe statistically significant geographic spillovers from roads, suggesting broad and beneficial health and nutrition payoffs from transportation development.","[Thapa, Ganesh] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, Yak & Yeti Hotel Complex,Durbar Marg, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",The World Bank; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Thapa, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, Yak & Yeti Hotel Complex,Durbar Marg, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.",gthapa1@worldbank.org; shivelyg@purdue.edu,,,Purdue Policy Research Institute; Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition - United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-OAA-10-00005],Purdue Policy Research Institute; Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition - United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This work was supported by the Purdue Policy Research Institute and the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Nutrition, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID, Grant No: AID-OAA-10-00005).

Then, using data from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups, we find no evidence that MMLs affect employment, hours, or wages among working-age adults, including among demographic groups whose marijuana consumption is most impacted by MMLs. Medical marijuana laws that provide access to open marijuana dispensaries only moderately depress wages among young men.

However, that relationship is significantly attenuated by the addition of a few control variables, suggesting that individuals with higher propensities to have mixed-race births are more likely to live in desegregated school districts. We exploit quasi-random variation from court-ordered school desegregation to estimate causal effects of school desegregation on mixed-race childbearing, finding small to moderate effects that are largely statistically insignificant. Because the upward trend across cohorts in mixed-race childbearing was substantial, separating the effects of desegregation plans from secular cohort trends is difficult; results are sensitive to how we specify the cohort trends and to the inclusion of Chicago/Cook County in the sample. The fact that the addition of a few control variables substantially weakens the cross-sectional relationship between lower levels of school segregation and higher rates of mixed-race childbearing suggests that a substantial portion of the observed correlation is likely due to who chooses to live in places with desegregated schools. Researchers should be cautious about interpreting raw correlations between segregation-whether residential or school-and other outcomes as causal. Our results also point to the need to carefully explore specification of cohort effects in quasi-experimental designs for treatments where cumulative exposure is important.","[Gordon, Nora] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Gordon, Nora] NBER, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Reber, Sarah] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Reber, Sarah] NBER, Los Angeles, CA USA",Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gordon, N (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Gordon, N (通讯作者)，NBER, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",neg24@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,55,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Models with very different-looking structures can be understood in common reduced-form terms.

We then combine lawsuit data from Derwent Litalert with non-practicing entity (NPE) lawsuits collected by Patent Freedom, and use an event-study approach to estimate losses suffered by alleged infringers during 1984-2009. To estimate rents, we combine patent data from the USPTO and EPO with financial data from COMPUSTAT, and use market-value regressions to estimate the value of patent rents for publicly-traded US firms during 1979-2002. We find that private costs exceed private rents during 1999-2000 and the trend in costs is sharply higher. Costs also exceed forecasts of rents for 2005-09.

Arguing that conventional tests of the EH need to assume EGPs that may be significantly at odds with the true EGP, we investigate this possibility by analyzing the out-of-sample predictive performances of several models for predicting interest rates, including a few models which assume that the EH holds in its functional form that relates long- to short-term yields. Using US riskless yield data for a 1970-2016 monthly sample and testing methods that take into account the parameter uncertainty, the null hypothesis of an equal predictive accuracy of each model relative to the random walk alternative is hardly ever rejected at intermediate and long horizons. This confirms that, at least at a practical level, the main difficulty with the EH is represented by the effective prediction of short-term rates. We discuss the relevance of these findings for central banks' use of forward guidance. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, this research investigates the effect of risk preferences on higher education enrollment decisions. A sample from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) was analyzed, and the results indicate that consumer risk preferences have a significant effect on the likelihood of enrollment. Specifically, there was a robust, positive relationship between risk tolerance and the likelihood of enrollment even after controlling for time preferences and risk perceptions. Consistent with previous findings, ability, parental education, family net worth and income, and being female were positively associated with the likelihood of enrollment. The results suggest that risk preferences may be an important source of omitted variable bias in previous studies of higher education investment choices.","[Heckman, Stuart J.] Kansas State Univ, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, Personal Financial Planning, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Montalto, Catherine P.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Kansas State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Heckman, SJ (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, Personal Financial Planning, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",sheckman@ksu.edu; montalto.2@osu.edu,,,,,,,75,11,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Divergence manifests itself in many ways, including per capita income, labor force participation, and the spatial distribution of skills and returns to education. At the same time, geographical polarization of political preferences and electoral choices has increased, with gains in populism and nationalism in some regions, and broadening of socially liberal, pro-trade and multicultural attitudes in other regions. The task of explaining these developments poses challenges to economic geography and regional and urban economics. These fields have already developed some of the building blocks of an account, but a number of important gaps persist.

ERM encompasses activities and strategies which enable the company to systematically identify, measure, reduce or exploit, as well as to control and monitor the exposure to various types of corporate risks - strategic, financial, operational, reporting as well as compliance risks. By considering the interactive effects of different risk events, ERM offers a balance between the dual nature of risk - ensuring effective protection from threats and seizing the opportunities. This paper explores the association between ERM and a set of fundamental value determinants of S&P 500 non-financial companies over the period from 2003 to 2012. Contrary to arguments found in the existing ERM literature, ERM companies did not experience a positive effect on most of the value drivers. We find that ERM is associated with lower expected growth rates within one to two years after the ERM adoption, indicating that ERM could even have a negative effect on the company's fundamental value. On the other hand, the study showed that ERM is associated with higher free cash flows after six years of its use. Our research thus found indicative evidence that ERM produces some positive effects over a longer term, as well as some negative immediate effects, which could be explained with the increased risk aversion of ERM companies. However, since the tested models are explorative in nature, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to establish how ERM really works within a company.","[Marc, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Management & Org, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Sprcic, Danijela Milos] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Managerial Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Zagar, Marina Mesin] Univ Southern Calif, USC Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Zagar, Marina Mesin] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Org & Management, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Zagreb; University of Southern California; University of Zagreb,"Marc, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Acad Unit Management & Org, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mojca.marc@ef.uni-lj.si; dmilos@efzg.hr; mesin@marshall.usc.edu,"Sprčić, Danijela Miloš/I-2456-2018","Marc, Mojca/0000-0002-6563-0279",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,"We would like to thank the University of Zagreb for the financial support granted to the research project Impact of Enterprise Risk Management on the Company's Financial Performance in a Period of the Global Financial Crisis.

This was a period in which Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) increasingly used physician cost control incentives but Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) did not. We show that cost growth and its components cannot be understood without accounting for (1) consumers' switching between plans, and (2) differences in cost characteristics between new entrants and those leaving the market. New entrants are markedly less costly than those leaving (and their costs fall after their entering year), so cost growth of continuing enrollees in a plan is significantly higher than average per-member cost growth. Relatively high-cost HMO members switch to PPOs while low-cost PPO members switch to HMOs, so the impact of cost control incentives on HMO costs is likely different from their impact on market-wide insurer costs.","[Ho, Kate] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pakes, Ariel] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Room 117, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shepard, Mark] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 JFK St,Mailbox 114, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ho, Kate; Pakes, Ariel; Shepard, Mark] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ho, K (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Ho, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kh2214@columbia.edu; apakes@fas.harvard.edu; mark_shepard@hks.harvard.edu,,,Commonwealth Fund; NIH via the National Bureau of Economic Research [P01AG005842]; National Institute on Aging [T32-AG000186],Commonwealth Fund; NIH via the National Bureau of Economic Research; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support for this work through a grant from the Commonwealth Fund.

Many studies argue that knowledge spillovers are localized based on the observation that patents tend to cite nearby patents disproportionately. Specifically, patent citations are typically interpreted as marking the transmission of knowledge from the cited invention to the citing invention. The localization of patent citations is therefore taken as evidence that such knowledge transmission is also localized. Localization of knowledge transmission, however, may not be the only reason that patent citations are localized. Using a set of citations that are unlikely to be associated with knowledge transmission from the cited to the citing invention, we present evidence that challenges the view that localization of citations is driven by localized knowledge transmission. While we are silent on the question of whether knowledge transmission is localized, to the extent that such localization exists, we argue that it is unlikely to be captured by patent citations.","[Arora, Ashish; Belenzon, Sharon; Lee, Honggi] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, NBER, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Belenzon, S (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",sharon.belenzon@duke.edu,,,,,,,53,12,15,4,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Today, proponents of randomized control trials (so-called randomistas) are among the most influential of development experts. This paper examines the growth of this thought collective, analysing how uncertainty has become a central concern of development institutions. It demonstrates that transformations within the aid industry - including the influence of evidence-based policy, the economization of development and the retreat from macro-planning - created the conditions of possibility for experimentation. Within this field, the randomistas adeptly pursued a variety of rhetorical, affective, methodological and organizational strategies that emphasized the lack of credible knowledge within aid and the ability of experiments to rectify the situation. Importantly, they have insisted on the moral worth of experimentation; indeed, the experimental ethic has been proposed as the way to change the spirit of development. Through causal certitude, they propose to reduce human suffering. The rise of experimentation has not, however, eliminated accusations of uncertainty; rather, it has redistributed the means through which knowledge about development is considered credible.","[Donovan, Kevin P.] Univ Michigan, Program Anthropol & Hist, Room 1029,435 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Donovan, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Program Anthropol & Hist, Room 1029,435 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kevinpd@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE1256260],National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper was substantially written while in residence at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, and I am grateful to its director, Dagmar Schafer, for welcoming me.

After documenting deviations from rationality in survey-based inflation expectations, I apply a model selection algorithm, boosting, to the inflation expectations of households and professionals. The algorithm builds a regression-like model of expected inflation using a large panel of macroeconomic data as possible covariates. The algorithm achieves a very strong fit in-sample, and finds that the inflation expectations of households correlate with different macroeconomic variables from the expectations of professionals. However, it is difficult to exploit the predictability of inflation expectations in order to improve forecasts of the realized inflation.

We collect procurement data and use a difference-in-difference approach to compare outcomes before and after the investigation in Montreal and in Quebec City, where there have been no allegations of collusion or corruption. We find that entry and participation increased, and that the price of procurement decreased. We then decompose the price decrease to quantify the importance of two aspects of cartel organization, coordination and entry deterrence, for collusive pricing.

This paper examines how the fire affected housing prices in vulnerable neighboring areas that were not directly impacted by the fire, controlling for the property's level of risk. This damaging fire may have increased home owners' perceptions about the risk of living in forested areas subject to wildfires to a significant degree adding to the total direct economic losses from the fire. Utilizing a unique fire risk data set and a difference-indifference approach, we test whether buyers of houses in areas with different risk levels prior to the fire adjust expectations differently. We find buyers in the highest risk area are most likely to change their perceptions in response to a fire with houses in these areas experiencing a statistically significant 21.7% decline in sale price compared to houses in non-risky areas.","[Kiel, Katherine A.; Matheson, Victor A.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 17A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Kiel, KA (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 17A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",kkiel@holycross.edu; vmatheso@holycross.edu,"Chen, Wei Han/J-5735-2018",,Weiss Summer Research Program in Economics; Committe on Faculty Scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross,Weiss Summer Research Program in Economics; Committe on Faculty Scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross,"We thank Charles Cunningham, Gregory Joyce, Brendan Perra, and Matthew Zakrewski for excellent research assistance, and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

I test this using executive contracts from S&P 500 firms. I find that firms pay severance in discretionary installments to induce their executives to comply with noncompete agreements-but only in California, where noncompetes are void. Outside California, noncompetes are valid and these same firms pay non-discretionary severance upfront.

The creation of the experimental stimuli is informed by a review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine information sheets. The results suggest that, in the context of childhood vaccines, the inclusion of pictographs alongside numeric (e.g. 1/5) probability information can result in higher probability comprehension and lower risk perception for multiple-risk options; however, these effects are not observed for single-risk options.

Prior to enslavement, Africans lived in agricultural settings. Despite the horrors of slavery, their cultural attachment to the land in their homelands would prove beneficial after emancipation. Developing an agrarian spirit and accumulating land at a rate beyond that of whites in the first few decades of freedom, despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, black land ownership peaked in the early 1900s. Thereafter, African Americans began to lose their land faster than whites. This article explores the larger context of the South, the creativity African Americans showed in resistance and in declaring themselves human, the movement toward land ownership, and the ways and means by which African Americans lost their land.

This paper examines the impact of (lack of) productivity growth, union bargaining power, and contracting out on cost escalation. We draw from a 17-year (1997-2014) and a 415-bus transit agency panel with 5780 observations by type of operation (directly operated by the agency or contracted out). We have three main findings: first, the unit cost increase in the transit sector is far worse than what economic theory predicts for industries with low productivity growth. Second, contracting out tends to reduce unit costs, and the results suggest that the costs savings from private operations can be only partly explained by lower wages in the private sector. Interestingly, we find that the cost savings from contracting out are larger when the transit agency also directly operates part of the total transit service. However, while overall unit costs are lower in contracted services, cost growth in large private bus operators is no different than cost growth in large public transit operators. Third, unique transit labor laws that lead to union bargaining power are a likely driver of the unit cost growth above inflation. Overall, these factors reflect inherent characteristics of the bus transit sector, such as the nature of low productivity growth and union legislative power related to the need for public subsidy. They drive increases in both transit fares and public subsidy at rates higher than inflation, and play an important role in the deterioration of transit agencies' financial sustainability.","[Sarriera, Javier Morales; Salvucci, Frederick P.; Zhao, Jinhua] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhao, JH (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",javierms@mit.edu; salvucci@mit.edu; jinhua@mit.edu,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Zhao, Jinhua/0000-0002-1929-7583",US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center,US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center,We would like to thank the US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center for partially funding this research.,,21,5,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Our difference-indifferences specification exploits the differential impact across districts in Indonesia of a reform that restricted the migration of Indonesian female domestic workers towards Saudi Arabia in 2011. Our results suggest that this reform did not lead to higher unemployment in Indonesia, but it increased the proportion of workers employed in informal jobs and in agriculture. No detectable change in the consumption patterns of Indonesian households appears from our analysis, suggesting that rural areas in Indonesia could absorb the sudden increase in the availability of workforce. Our findings also show an increase in junior secondary school enrolment of both males and females, arguably reflecting the importance of the maternal presence in the household for the investment in human capital of children.","[Makovec, Mattia; Purnamasari, Ririn S.; Savitri, Astrid R.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sandi, Matteo] London Sch Econ, CEP, London, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Makovec, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mmakovec@worldbank.org,,"Sandi, Matteo/0000-0003-4333-8821",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,62,1,1,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We find that men tend to be more satisfied with younger wives and less satisfied with older wives. Interestingly, women likewise tend to be more satisfied with younger husbands and less satisfied with older husbands. Marital satisfaction declines with marital duration for both men and women in differently aged couples relative to those in similarly aged couples. These relative declines erase the initial higher levels of marital satisfaction experienced by men married to younger wives and women married to younger husbands within 6 to 10 years of marriage. A possible mechanism is that differently aged couples are less resilient to negative shocks compared to similarly aged couples, which we find some supportive evidence for.","[Lee, Wang-Sheng] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Lee, Wang-Sheng] IZA, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [McKinnish, Terra] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McKinnish, Terra] IZA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Deakin University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Lee, WS (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.;Lee, WS (通讯作者)，IZA, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",wang.lee@deakin.edu.au; terra.mckinnish@colorado.edu,,,Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for providing very helpful comments and suggestions.

Application of the MIMIC model has allowed to identify the following causal factors of the shadow economy in the Eurozone: employment rate, gender wage gap and income inequalities (expressed as the GINI index). All of these causal factors of the shadow economy in the Eurozone are attributable to the group of labour market determinants, which proposes that a reasonably arranged labour market mechanism can substantially diminish the probability of the shadow economy emergence. On the other hand, it has been found that the level of the shadow economy determines a positive/negative degree of the public trust in the EU authorities. The novelty of the research lies in the disclosure of the main causal factors of the shadow economy in the geographical area that covers different countries with a single currency.

One major barrier to greater consumer acceptance of PEVs is the lack of home parking spaces for charging outlets. This study developed a methodology to estimate the residential parking ratios (parking spaces vs household numbers) and project the residential community-weighted parking availabilities (home parking availabilities) in China, by area and by province, through data mining from several major real estate trading network platforms. The results show that the home parking availabilities from 2015 to 2050 vary by geographic areas and building life expectancy. A method was developed to quantify the shadow values of home parking impacting on PEV ownership costs and combined with Monte Carlo simulation to address estimation uncertainty. Depending on the PEV type and all electric range, the value of home parking space to a PEV owner, measured by the reduced vehicle ownership cost, ranges from $2399 USD to $10,802 USD. The total incremental shadow value, relative to the 2015 situation, of the home parking availability for PEV owners increases over time due to both improvement in home parking availability and increase in the PEV population, and is estimated to reach over $2.51 billion USD by 2025 (U.S. dollars in 2015 level).","[Ou, Shiqi; Lin, Zhenhong] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA; [He, Xin; Przesmitzki, Steven] Aramco Serv Co, Aramco Res Ctr Detroit, Novi, MI 48377 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Aramco Services Company (ASC),"Lin, ZH (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA.",ous1@ornl.gov; linz@ornl.gov; xin.he@aramcoservices.com; steven.przesmitzki@aramcoservices.com,"Lin, Zhenhong/ISA-9347-2023; Ou, Shawn/AAI-4007-2021; Lin, Zhenhong/AAJ-9468-2021; He, Xin/I-4240-2012; Ou, Shawn/GXM-9183-2022","Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; He, Xin/0000-0003-2492-4454",Aramco Services Company,Aramco Services Company,"The authors would like to thank the Aramco Services Company for their generous financial support for this study, and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center for their data support.

Results show that the relationship between carbon emission and economic growth in China during the recent decade has the development tendency toward an inverse U-shaped curve, approximately confirming the carbon emission's Kuznets curve hypothesis in China. There exists a significant spatial correlation between carbon emission and economic growth, implying that carbon emission in a province may be influenced by economic growth in adjacent provinces. When economic growth reaches 279.91 million Yuan/km(2) GDP (at a comparable price in 2000), the contradiction between economic growth and carbon emission begins to be gradually alleviated. These findings provide new insights and valuable information for reducing carbon emissions in China.","[Xu, Hengzhou; Zhang, Wenjing; Yin, Hongchun] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chuanrong; Li, Weidong] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Tianjin University; University of Connecticut,"Yin, HC (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",xuhengzhou@163.com; Cindyzhang2003@126.com; weidongli2003@126.com; wenjingzh@tju.edu.cn; hongchunyin2012@163.com,"li, chris/IXX-2900-2023",,National Social Science Foundation of China: Evaluation on Effect of Rural Land Rights Confirmation Policy Implementation under the Perspective of Household Livelihood Diversity [17BJY090]; Humanities and Social Sciences projects of the Ministry of Education Farmers' behavior response to farmland ownership and its impact on rural land transfer [16YJC630149],National Social Science Foundation of China: Evaluation on Effect of Rural Land Rights Confirmation Policy Implementation under the Perspective of Household Livelihood Diversity; Humanities and Social Sciences projects of the Ministry of Education Farmers' behavior response to farmland ownership and its impact on rural land transfer,This research has been supported by National Social Science Foundation of China: Evaluation on Effect of Rural Land Rights Confirmation Policy Implementation under the Perspective of Household Livelihood Diversity (Grants: 17BJY090) and Humanities and Social Sciences projects of the Ministry of Education Farmers' behavior response to farmland ownership and its impact on rural land transfer (Grants: 16YJC630149).,,52,7,7,9,48,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

After documenting variation in mode choice, urban form, and vehicle ownership, we fit a multinomial logit model to data from 2.5 million commuters who reported a work commute on the 2015 Intercensus. We estimate whether a person commutes by transit, car, or walking/biking as a function of commuters' gender, age, employment status, household income, and seven measures of urban form and transportation supply. Across urban areas, commuters are less likely to drive in dense urban areas where jobs are spatially concentrated jobs and near population centers. Commuters are also less likely to drive in areas with better public transit supply and less roadway. Collectively the measures of urban form are as strongly related to the probability someone commutes to work by car as household income. Population density plays a particularly strongly role with an estimated elasticity four times as strong as recent studies from US urban areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that land use planning and transportation investments can and do influence commute patterns. Recent public policies have almost certainly contributed to increased, rather than decreased driving and associated congestion, pollution, and traffic fatalities.","[Guerra, Erick] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Dept City & Reg Planning, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Caudillo, Camilo; Montejano, Jorge] AC CentroGeo CONACYT, Ctr Invest Ciencias Informac Geoespacial, Contoy 137 Esq Chemax, Col Lomas De Padierna 14240, Delegacion Tlal, Mexico; [Monkkonen, Paavo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, 337 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Guerra, E (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Design, Dept City & Reg Planning, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",erickg@upenn.edu; ccaudillo@centrogeo.edu.mx; paavo.monkkonen@ucla.edu; jmontejano@centrogeo.edu.mx,"Monkkonen, Paavo/B-7935-2010; Caudillo, Camilo/ITU-7881-2023; Caudillo, Camilo/D-5026-2013; Montejano-Escamilla, Jorge Alberto/B-2249-2017","Caudillo, Camilo/0000-0002-2450-5295; Guerra, Erick/0000-0002-7769-2581; Monkkonen, Paavo/0000-0002-3513-0230; Montejano-Escamilla, Jorge Alberto/0000-0002-6914-1229",Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions (CM2) University Transportation Center,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions (CM2) University Transportation Center,"This paper builds on a report funded by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (Montejano et al. 2018): We are grateful for comments received from anonymous reviewers, Lincoln Institute staff, and participants at a joint Berkeley and Lincoln Institute conference on transit technologies in Latin American cities in May, 2017.

We present evidence from the 2008 Democratic Party nomination race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton showing that the answer is yes. Both cross-sectional and time series evidence suggests that market prices contain information about election outcomes that polls taken shortly before the contests do not. Conversely, election surprises relative to polls too Granger cause subsequent price movements. We then investigate whether the additional information in prices could come from the media coverage of these campaigns, and uncover a set of complex relationships between pollster's surprise, price movements, and various aspects of media coverage. Prices anticipate the balance and content of media coverage, but not the volume. On the other hand, it is the volume of media coverage, not the balance or content, that anticipates the surprise element in election outcomes. Moreover, Granger causality between prices and election surprises barely changes after controlling for media coverage, and causality from media volume to surprises persists too after controlling for price movements. Taken together, the results suggest that both prices and the volume of media coverage contain independent election-relevant information that is not captured in polls.

The question studied in this article is why adjudication should be designed so as to permit the use of motions. The answer developed is that litigants will naturally a great deal about their specific matter, whereas a court will ordinarily little except to the degree that the court has already invested effort to appreciate it. By giving litigants the right to bring motions, the judicial system leads litigants to efficiently provide information to courts that is relevant to the adjudicative process.","[Shavell, Steven] Harvard Law Sch, 1563 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Shavell, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, 1563 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shavell@law.harvard.edu,,,"John M.

In this literature, an important parameter is the social weight placed on population size; a standard result is that a planner with a larger weight on population chooses larger population levels and growth rates. We demonstrate that this result is conditionally overturned when an exhaustible resource constraint is introduced: if the discount rate is small enough, the optimal population today decreases with the welfare weight on population size. That is, a more total-utilitarian social planner could prefer a smaller population today than a more average-utilitarian social planner. We also present a numerical illustration applied to the case of climate change, where we show that under plausible real-world parameter values, our result matters for the direction and magnitude of optimal population policy.","[Lawson, Nicholas] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Bur DS 5819, 320 Rue Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X IL7, Canada; [Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Delhi Ctr, 7 SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Lawson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Bur DS 5819, 320 Rue Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X IL7, Canada.",lawson.nicholas@uqam.ca; dspears@utexas.edu,,,,,,,53,8,9,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Requirements on employees knowledge have been rising in recent years, especially with regard to the new trends and currently the widely discussed fourth industrial revolution. In the emerging network economy and knowledge society, organisations must be ready for complex knowledge dissemination and management processes. Knowledge is collected, stored, assessed, and created by an organisation and shared by its members. In the course of knowledge dissemination, members of the organisation create synergy which generates unique knowledge. Managing organisational knowledge necessary for the creation of added value and the acquisition of a competitive advantage requires evaluating the knowledge synergy and its components. The paper aims at identifying knowledge synergy components and providing an evaluation method of employees' knowledge synergy and its components to have a rational and objective evaluation of employees' knowledge, relations among employees, and organisational knowledge synergy. To achieve this aim, knowledge synergy components are identified, evaluation issues are revealed, types of knowledge synergy relations are presented together with an evaluation formula for each of these relations, components of employees' knowledge and factors reflecting knowledge content are specified, an evaluation formula for each component is provided, and an organisational knowledge synergy evaluation method is described.

The Highway Capacity Manual is primarily used for operational analysis on two lane highways in the U.S. and Canada. As part of a project sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program for improving two-lane highway operational analysis methodology, a practice survey was conducted to gather information on agency experiences in regards to performance measurement on two-lane highways. The survey was sent to all state Departments of Transportation in the United States and Canada. A total of 35 usable responses were received, representing 25 states and 4 Canadian provinces. This paper summarizes the results of the agency survey and presents the most important findings. Results suggest that the top three criteria for good performance measures are: sensitivity to traffic conditions, sensitivity to road conditions, and relevance to road user perception. Further, agencies identified average travel speed as the most relevant traffic flow aspect to two-lane highway operations. Other performance measures that were found meritorious were volume-to-capacity ratio and flow rate, for class I and class II highways, respectively, versus the latter measures and percent-time-spent-following for class III highways.","[Al-Kaisy, Ahmed] Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Jafari, Amirhossein] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Washburn, Scott] Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lutinnen, Tapio] Aalto Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Helsinki, Finland; [Dowling, Richard] Kittelson & Associates Inc, Portland, OR USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Aalto University,"Al-Kaisy, A (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",aalkaisy@ce.montana.edu; amirhossein.jafari@msu.montana.edu; swash@ce.ufl.edu; tapio.luttinen@aalto.fi; rdowling@kittelson.com,"Al-Kaisy, Ahmed/Q-6826-2019","Al-Kaisy, Ahmed/0000-0003-1198-0975; Washburn, Scott/0000-0002-5442-6790",National Cooperative Highway Research Program,National Cooperative Highway Research Program,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided for this study by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program.

There is, however, no consensus in the literature on whether it actually matters for wages, and if it does, what are the underlying mechanisms. We empirically examine these issues specifically for rural migrants in urban China, a country where one of the largest domestic migration in human history has occurred over the past decades. We find that there exists a significant wage penalty for those migrant workers who have conducted their search through informal channels, despite their popularity. Our further analysis suggests two potential reasons for the wage penalty: (1) the informal job search sends a negative signal (of workers' inability to successfully find a job in a competitive market) to potential employers, resulting in lower wages, and (2) there exists a trade-off between wages and search efficiency for quicker entry into local labor market.

The police, fire, health and social service departments are tasked with mitigating such social harm through various types of interventions. While various different social harm indices have been proposed for allocating resources to spatially fixed hotspots, the risk of social harm events is dynamic, and new algorithms and software systems that are capable of quickly identifying risks and triggering appropriate public safety responses are needed. We propose a novel modulated Hawkes process for this purpose that offers flexible approaches to both (i) the incorporation of spatial covariates and leading indicators for variance reduction in the case of rarer event categories, and (ii) the capture of dynamic hotspot formation through self-excitation. We present an efficient l1-penalized EM algorithm for estimating the model that performs feature selection for the spatial covariates of each incident type simultaneously. We provide simulation results using data from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in order to illustrate the advantages of the modulated Hawkes process model of social harm over various recently introduced social harm indices and property crime Hawkes processes.

As in many network technology adoption decisions, hospitals face countervailing incentives to coordinate or differentiate in their choice of vendors. We find evidence of substantial agglomeration on EMR vendors, which increases as hospital markets become more competitive. These findings suggest that incentives to coordinate dominate incentives to differentiate overall, and the relative balance grows stronger in favor of coordination as markets become more competitive. Our findings also have important implications regarding antitrust policy. A potential downside of hospital consolidation-increased obstacles in information sharing due to vendor differentiation-should be taken into account in evaluation of hospital mergers.","[Freedman, Seth] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Lin, Haizhen; Prince, Jeffrey] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Prince, J (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, 1309 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",freedmas@indiana.edu; hzlin@indiana.edu; jeffprin@indiana.edu,,"Prince, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4844-8624",NET Institute,NET Institute,This work was supported by a NET Institute (www.netinst.org) research grant.

Google's introduction of Universal Search in 2007 integrated specialized search results within a narrow category (for example, shopping or local businesses) with its customary blue links. This integration led to objections that Google was engaging in search bias, and thus foreclosing specialized search rivals to the detriment of competition and consumers. In this paper, we describe the precise nature of the anticompetitive claims against Google and develop an economic framework and empirical test to assess these claims. We rely upon our economic framework to offer insights for competition authorities to consider for future cases involving platforms and allegations of foreclosure and exclusion.","[Yun, John M.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Global Antitrust Inst, Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Yun, John M.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Global Antitrust Inst, Econ Educ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Yun, John M.] US Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20580 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Yun, JM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Global Antitrust Inst, Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.;Yun, JM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Global Antitrust Inst, Econ Educ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.;Yun, JM (通讯作者)，US Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",jyun9@gmu.edu,,"Yun, John/0000-0002-3890-7316",,,,,34,2,2,2,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Our inquiry spotlights an approach recently embraced by some courts benchmarking fair value against the merger price itself. We show that the merger price deference effectively nullifies the role that appraisal can potentially play in establishing a de facto reserve price for company auctions, thereby depressing both acquisition prices and target shareholders' expected welfare relative to both the optimal appraisal policy and a variety of other valuation measures. We also examine conditions under which deference to the merger price may nonetheless be defensible on economic grounds. Our results have empirical implications for understanding appraisal, and they likewise help to inform doctrine by providing guidance to legal actors about when a sales process can be considered sufficiently robust to justify deal price deference.","[Choi, Albert H.] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Talley, Eric] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; Columbia University,"Choi, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",achoi@law.virginia.edu; etalley@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Among dual job holders, our study finds that the Stone-Geary income and wage elasticities are much larger for labor supply to the second job compared with the main job. When the effects of selection and unobserved heterogeneity are taken account of, the magnitudes of these elasticities on the second job tend to be significantly reduced.","[Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, ERICA Campus,55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Oaxaca, Ronald L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, McClelland Hall 401,POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Renna, Francesco] Univ Akron, Dept Econ, CBA 324, Akron, OH 44325 USA",Hanyang University; University of Arizona; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Renna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Dept Econ, CBA 324, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr; rlo@email.arizona.edu; frenna@uakron.edu,"; Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","renna, francesco/0000-0001-6357-8377; Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8014290],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We thank three anonymous referees for comments that greatly improved the paper.

Starting from a random allocation of firms across cities, firms relocate in pursuit of greater profit. There are several key results. First, there is a positive and nonlinear relationship between the strength of inter-industry external economies and coagglomeration, a result that supports using coagglomeration to study the microfoundations of agglomeration economies and to determine the boundaries of industry clusters. Second, the equilibrium level of coagglomeration is less than the efficient level. Third, history matters in the sense that a legacy of homogeneous or heterogeneous cities tilts the economy in favor of the historical pattern. Fourth, an increase in firm size increases coagglomeration. Fifth, an increase in relocation cost increases coagglomeration.","[O'Sullivan, Arthur; Strange, William C.] Lewis & Clark Coll, Econ, 0615 SW Palatine Hill Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA; [Strange, William C.] Univ Toronto, Real Estate, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Strange, WC (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Real Estate, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",wstrange@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Centre for Real Estate at the Rotman School of Management,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Centre for Real Estate at the Rotman School of Management,"We thank Heski Bar-Isaac, Robert Helsley, Jordan Rappaport, Kristian Behrens and two helpful referees for comments on previous versions of the article.

However, the nexus of the three literatures is surprisingly thin, in particular with regard to the conditions under which collocation is an advantage or a disadvantage.

Standard remedies can compensate plaintiffs for unknown harms, but it is expensive to do so. Damage awards will generally undercompensate or overcompensate a plaintiff whose true harm is unknown, while equitable remedies that provide more tailored compensation are generally wasteful. In this article I develop a novel remedy that compensates plaintiffs for unobservable private values at the lowest possible cost to the defendant. This remedy consists of offering the plaintiff the choice between intermediate damages and an inalienable injunction that restores the underlying harm at the conclusion of the trial. I show that this remedy is robust to errors by the court and potential post judgment renegotiation. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this remedy reduces litigants' incentives to lie during trial. Finally, I consider ex ante deterrence and show conditions under which the remedy improves social welfare relative to optimal damages.","[Atkinson, Nathan] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Atkinson, Nathan] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Atkinson, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nathana@stanford.edu,,"Atkinson, Nathan/0000-0002-0820-6084",Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; McCoy Center for Ethics in Society; John M.

Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants' endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists' prescriptions.

Absent intragenerational heterogeneity, we show that a benevolent government has no welfare justification for introducing public pensions alongside thriving family compacts since the former is associated with inefficiently low fertility. This result hinges critically on a fiscal externality-the inability of middle age agents to internalize the impact of their fertility decisions on old-age transfers under a public pension system. With homogeneous agents, a strong-enough negative aggregate shock to middle-age incomes destroys all family compacts, and in such a setting, an optimal public pension system cannot enter. This suggests the raison d'tre for social security must lie outside of its function as a pension system-specifically its redistributive function which emerges with heterogeneous agents. In a simple modification of our benchmark model-one that allows for idiosyncratic frictions to compact formation such as differences in infertility/mating status-a welfare-enhancing role for a public pension system emerges; such systems may flourish even when family compacts cannot.","[Barnett, Richard C.] Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, Sch Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bhattacharya, Joydeep] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Puhakka, Mikko] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oulu, Finland",Drexel University; Iowa State University; University of Oulu,"Bhattacharya, J (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",rclaybarnett@yahoo.com; joydeep@iastate.edu; mikko.puhakka@oulu.fi,,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/0000-0002-3148-4592",Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OKO Bank Foundation,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OKO Bank Foundation,"Puhakka thanks the Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation and the OKO Bank Foundation for support.

Moreover, incarceration and other forms of criminal justice contact ranging from police stops to community supervision are disproportionately concentrated among African American and Latino men. Mass incarceration, and other ways in which the criminal justice system infiltrates the lives of families, has critical implications for inequality. Differential rates of incarceration damage the social and emotional development of children whose parents are in custody or under community supervision. The removal through incarceration of a large segment of earners reinforces existing income and wealth disparities. Patterns of incarceration and felony convictions have devastating effects on the level of voting, political engagement, and overall trust in the legal system within communities. Incarceration also has damaging effects on the health of families and communities. In short, the costs of mass incarceration are not simply collateral consequences for individuals but are borne collectively, most notably by African Americans living in acutely disadvantaged communities that experience high levels of policing and surveillance. In this article, we review racial and ethnic differences in exposure to the criminal justice system and its collective consequences.","[Pettit, Becky] Univ Texas Austin, Liberal Arts Sociol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gutierrez, Carmen] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Pettit, B (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Liberal Arts Sociol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bpettit@utexas.edu; carmen.gutierrez@utexas.edu,"Gutierrez, Carmen/HMO-7139-2023","Gutierrez, Carmen/0000-0001-9256-4468",Population Research Center [P2CHD042849],Population Research Center,"This research was supported by grant P2CHD042849, Population Research Center, awarded to the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

This paper studies the impacts of this support on local population and employment at both county and city levels. We use datasets which include geographic, transportation, and socioeconomic characteristics of California counties and cities from 1950 to 2010. Propensity score, one-to-one matching models are employed to draw units from the control group, which are counties/cities that do not have a state-supported Amtrak station, to match with units from the treatment group, which are counties/cities that do. Using regression analysis, we find that state-support Amtrak stations have significant effect on local population in the long term, and the effect increases with time.

Using the cumulative sum control chart and the Bai-Perron algorithm, we identify multiple structural breakpoints in the market P/E ratio and find that those structural changes are significantly perceived over the long run. Unlike previous studies that do not consider structural changes, our study is the first one that shows how structural changes asymmetrically influence long-term stock returns depending on the high or low P/E period. This implies that structural changes in the market P/E ratio play an important role in explaining long-term stock returns. We propose that structural changes should be taken into account in some manner to establish the relationship between P/E ratios and long-term stock returns.","[Baek, Chung] Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Troy, AL 36082 USA; [Lee, Ingyu] Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Dept IS & QM, Troy, AL USA",Troy University System; Troy University; Troy University System; Troy University,"Baek, C (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",cbaek@tro.edu,,,,,,,23,4,6,2,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

There are several significant reasons why even a skeptic of the ITC's Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duty, and Safeguards docket (collectively, the Title VII docket)-as well as an antitrust skeptic-should be significantly less worried when cases normally expected to be brought in the Title VII portion of the ITC's docket as petitions are instead brought in the Section 337 portion of the ITC docket as complaints alleging ordinary violations of the antitrust laws. Private antitrust litigation fits with the plain meaning of the ITC's statute and with well-established antitrust case law. The ITC 337 docket also offers some practical benefits over courts and other agencies. The procedures do not rely heavily administrative deference; and do rely heavily on the full panoply of procedural devices ordinarily available in court for truth-testing of evidence including cross examination, all in a timeframe likely to be significantly shorter (around 18 months) than the many years typically required for antitrust litigation in federal court, and without the black box of a general jury verdict. What about the doctrine that federal courts developed called antitrust injury? The ITC relied on that doctrine to dismiss a case recently brought by the domestic U.S. steel industry against. Chinese importers of steel. This paper explores some reasons why that doctrine does not fit the ITC 337 statute.","[Kieff, F.

Our model motivates empirical hypotheses, which we test using data from manufacturers subject to the Clean Water Act. We find that penalties create positive spillovers for other facilities facing the same regulatory authority, such that enforcement actions reduce pollution at facilities in the same regulatory jurisdiction. However, penalties generate negative spillovers for facilities in the same industry facing a different authority, such that enforcement actions increase pollution at facilities in the same industry but facing a different regulator. Reductions in pollution in a state issuing a fine are about 50 percent offset by increases in pollution in nearby states.

The expected effect of the provision on fertility is not clear ex ante. By expanding insurance coverage to young adults, the provision may affect fertility directly through expanded options for obtaining contraceptives as well as through expanded options for obtaining pregnancy-, birth-, and infant-related care, and these may lead to decreased or increased fertility, respectively. In addition, the provision may also affect fertility indirectly through marriage or labor markets, and the direction and magnitude of these effects is difficult to determine. This paper considers the effect of the provision on fertility as well as the contributing channels by applying difference-in-differences type methods using the 2008-2010 and 2012-2013 American Community Survey, 2006-2009 and 2012-2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abortion surveillance data, and 2006-2010 and 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth. Results suggest that the provision is associated with decreases in the likelihood of having given birth and abortion rates and an increase in the likelihood of using long-term hormonal contraceptives.","[Abramowitz, Joelle] Univ Michigan, 3475 ISR Thompson,426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Abramowitz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 3475 ISR Thompson,426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jabramow@umich.edu,,,,,,,51,17,17,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

To partially address this gap, we construct a Chinese Patent Database linking State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patents to all listed firms and their subsidiaries in China, and we are making the database publicly available to the research community. We first develop a computer program to match the assignee names of SIPO patents to the names of listed firms and subsidiaries based on a similarity score, taking into account unique challenges associated with Chinese firm-names and Chinese characters. High-scoring likely matches are then checked manually to determine whether they are indeed true matches. The resulting database includes 191,325 SIPO patents matched to listed firms in China from 1990 to 2010. Using this database, we find a large amount of patenting heterogeneity across firms of different geographic locations, technological foci, and ownership types. We also leverage strengths of the data to conduct a detailed analysis of the patent examination process at the SIPO. Although there is not much difference in the examination process between listed firms and their nonlisted counterparts in China, substantial differences exist between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms experience substantial delay in publishing patent applications and requesting for substantive examination compared to Chinese firms. Such delay accounts for 40-60% of the longer duration from application date to decision date for foreign firms. However, after accounting for such delay, foreign firms still face much longer pendency in reaching an examination outcome (grant, withdrawal, or refusal) than Chinese firms. We hope that the public database and such analysis will encourage new streams of research on Chinese patents to improve our knowledge of China's fast-changing innovation landscape.","[He, Zi-Lin] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Tong, Tony W.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tong, Tony W.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Zhang, Yuchen] Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [He, Wenlong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tilburg University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Tulane University; University of International Business & Economics,"Tong, TW (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",z.l.he@uvt.nl; tonytong@purdue.edu; yzhang54@tulane.edu; wenlong.he@uibe.edu.cn,"Tong, Tony W/E-6103-2010; Zhang, Yuchen/GYI-8858-2022","He, Zi-Lin/0000-0002-1756-9960; , Wenlong/0000-0002-6328-9767",State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272131],State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71272131) for supporting this research.

In recent years, the emergence of craft producers has countered firm concentration and the homogenization of alcoholic beverages. Meanwhile, governments have intervened extensively in alcohol markets to reduce excessive consumption, raise taxes, protect domestic industries, and/or ensure competition.

We address the extent to which traditional wisdom and standard conceptual and empirical models that have girded thought about market power in the food chain for decades apply in modern food-market contexts and examine recent work on competition in the food chain to gauge the most promising paths forward. A key conclusion is that considerations that go beyond the bounds of standard models likely cause market power to be less than would be predicted based on the highly concentrated structures of many modern agricultural and food markets. These considerations include downstream buyers who rationally internalize long-run implications of their pricing decisions to farmers, powerful food manufacturers and retailers who countervail each other's market power, and the complex pricing decisions of multistore and multiproduct food retailers.","[Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Xia, Tian] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Kansas State University,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,163,59,64,1,40,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework. First, many applications (particularly in environmental economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using observations far from the temporal threshold. This common empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second, estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing to use the RD in time framework.","[Hausman, Catherine] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rapson, David S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hausman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",chausman@umich.edu; dsrapson@ucdavis.edu,,"Rapson, David/0000-0001-8711-7030",,,,,31,163,196,14,131,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

From the application of social cost-benefit analysis to investments in developing countries in the 1970s to the use of increasingly sophisticated general equilibrium models today, the menu of available techniques for policy assessment has expanded rapidly. In addition, both partial and general equilibrium models have been developed to analyze world markets for agricultural commodities and the effects of government policies on such markets. Alongside the modeling of markets and the quantitative impact of policies, several indicators have been developed that build on trade policy measures, including effective protection and tariff equivalents. One example is the producer subsidy equivalent. This has been used by theOECD to estimate the level of support provided by government policies to the agricultural sector. The indicators have more recently been applied to developing countries as a form of benchmarking to give a snapshot of the transfers among stakeholders inherent in such policies.","[Josling, Tim] Stanford Univ, Food Res Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Josling, Tim] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Food Res Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",josling@stanford.edu,,,,,,,56,0,0,3,9,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

But these regulators often lack the capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce CAC and MBI policies. As a result, the efficacy of those policies is an empirical matter. We review emerging experimental and quasi-experimental evidence on CAC and MBI policies in developing countries, specifically, from 32 studies of CAC policies and 8 studies of MBIs. Although drawn from a small and decidedly nonrandom sample of countries and policy types, the evidence clearly indicates that CAC and MBI policies can have significant environmental benefits in developing countries. In addition to cataloging and reviewing this evidence, we discuss data and methodological challenges to augmenting it and suggest directions for future research.","[Blackman, Allen] Interamer Dev Bank, Climate & Sustainable Dev Sect, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Li, Zhengyan; Liu, Antung A.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Blackman, A (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Climate & Sustainable Dev Sect, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",allenb@iadb.org; zl31@umail.iu.edu; aaliu@indiana.edu,"Li, Zhengyan/IWE-0862-2023; Li, Zhengyan/GSD-3935-2022; LI, ZHENGYAN/KCY-9486-2024","Li, Zhengyan/0000-0003-2006-2922;",,,,,66,97,100,18,112,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Such study is important for the assessment of the economic viability of these two agricultural systems. Although the existing research has widely used the stochastic frontier methodology and the data envelopment analysis nonparametric approach to assess farming performance, the use of the local maximum likelihood (LML) approach proposed by Kumbhakar et al. is scarce. This study represents the first analysis that compares the efficiency levels of organic and conventional farms in Egypt.

The production of sliced fresh pears is a promising alternative to overcome the lack of supplying consistently a product with superior quality with added convenience, potentially able to increase domestic consumption. In this paper, we used sensory evaluation and a Vickrey experimental auction to elicit consumers' preferences and willingness to pay for sliced packed fresh pears treated with SmartFresh (1-methylcyclopropene) and subsequently with a ripening compound (RC) in the form of glyoxylic acid at different concentration levels (1%, 2%, 3%, and control). Panelists were willing to pay a price premium equivalent to $0.119/2 oz packet for the 2% RC sample, $0.055/2 oz packet for the 3% RC sample, and $0.025/2 oz packet for the 1% RC sample compared to the control sample. Results from a market segmentation analyses indicate the presence of two groups in the panelist sample. The group that liked sliced pears assigned higher importance to locally grown fruit and price, shopped at conventional retailer grocery stores, had fewer children in the household, and were younger compared to the group that disliked sliced pears.","[Ikiz, Dila] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, POB 646210, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Gallardo, R.

These changes are forcing sugarcane producers and processors, to re-evaluate their vertical coordination and growth strategies. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between the vertical coordination strategies at the production-processing interface of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain and the technical efficiency of the mills. It utilizes data envelopment analysis and a Tobit censored model in combination with unique data on 204 mills that account for around half of Brazil's sugar and ethanol production. Results indicate that vertical integration and the location of the mill have a statistically significant impact on efficiency. The findings show that the technical efficiency is not the main driver of vertical integration implying that such decisions are primarily motivated by strategic considerations. The mills are likely to forgo gains in technical efficiency in exchange for improving their strategic position through vertical integration. These findings shed light on the underlying motivation for the observed level of vertical integration that accompanies the expansion of the Brazilian sugarcane industry.

Furthermore, since the early 2000s the craft segment has realized consistent growth whereas large breweries have seen a steady decline in sales. Macro-breweries have responded by acquiring smaller breweries to capture a share of the craft market.

By consequence, the deficit countries that attracted lots of foreign capital experienced large run-ups in house prices, whereas most surplus countries that exported capital exhibited flat or slow house price growth. We first use new house price data and a novel instrumental variable design to show the causal relationship between housing prices and capital inflows, particularly through debt bonanzas. We then argue that international capital flows affect the fiscal policy preferences of both voters and political parties by way of their impact on housing prices. Where capital inflows are large and housing prices are rising, we expect voters to respond by demanding both lower taxes and less publicly-provided social insurance because rising house prices allow homeowners to self-insure against income loss. In contrast, declining house prices produce greater demands for social insurance, particularly among those most exposed to housing market risk. We present evidence from two cross-national surveys that supports these claims, as well as a before and after analysis of the housing crash in Eastern Europe. We also show that the connection between house prices and social policy also manifests itself in government spending outcomes, mediated by partisan control.","[Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Broz, J.

In line with predictions from theory, this paper finds that, on average, lower dependency rates and greater longevity are associated with higher domestic saving rates. However, these correlations are statistically robust only in Asia. In particular, Latin America, which is a region that has undergone a remarkably similar saving friendly demographic transition since the 1970s, did not experience the same boost in saving rates as Asia. The paper highlights that the potential dividends arising from a favorable demographic transition are not automatically accrued.

The Family Options Study randomly assigned 2,282 families recruited in homeless shelters across 12 sites to priority access to one of three active interventions or to usual care in their communities. The interventions were long-term rent subsidies, short-term rent subsidies, and transitional housing in supervised programs with intensive psychosocial services. In two waves of follow-up data collected 20 and 37 months later, priority access to long-term rent subsidies reduced homelessness and food insecurity and improved other aspects of adult and child well-being relative to usual care, at a cost 9 percent higher. The other interventions had little effect. The study provides support for the view that homelessness for most families is an economic problem that long-term rent subsidies resolve and does not support the view that families must address psychosocial problems to succeed in housing. It has implications for focusing government resources on this important social problem.","[Gubits, Daniel; Wood, Michelle; Dastrup, Samuel R.] Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Shinn, Marybeth] Vanderbilt Univ, Human & Org Dev, Peabody Coll 90,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Brown, Scott R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Human & Org Dev, Peabody Coll 90,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Bell, Stephen H.] Westat Corp, Evaluat Res, 1600 Res Blvd, Rockville, MD 20850 USA",ABT Associates; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Westat,"Gubits, D (通讯作者)，Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",daniel_gubits@abtassoc.com; beth.shinn@vanderbilt.edu; michelle_wood@abtassoc.com; scott.r.brown@vanderbilt.edu; samuel_dastrup@abtassoc.com; stephen-bell@westat.com,,"Shinn, Marybeth/0000-0002-6681-8273","U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [C-CHI-00943, DU206SF-13-T-00005]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development [5R01HD066082]",U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This paper is based on a study that was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (contracts C-CHI-00943 [Task Orders 1 and 3] and DU206SF-13-T-00005) and which received additional funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (grant 5R01HD066082).

J,"Talukdar, D",,,,"Talukdar, Debabrata",,,Cost of being a slum dweller in Nairobi: Living under dismal conditions but still paying a housing rent premium,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Informal housing markets; Rent premiums; Slums; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa,MARKETS; CITIES; POVERTY; QUALITY; DEMAND; KENYA; PRICE; POOR; CITY,"The UN notes that the current global slum population of nearly one billion not only reflects a rather unacceptable contemporary reality, but one whose numbers are continuously swelling. Not surprisingly, its latest global development priorities, announced through its Sustainable Development Goals agenda in 2015, emphasize addressing the slum challenge in developing countries as a major goal. Our study focuses on gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature and extent of such slum challenge faced by Nairobi. Specifically, using data from a recent (2012-13) statistically representative survey, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the rental housing market conditions faced by households living in slum versus formal areas of Nairobi. Our analysis findings establish relevant benchmarking for key policy relevant measures against which to evaluate the efficacy of new policy initiatives. Taken together, our findings show that the households in Nairobi's slum areas, compared to their counterparts in formal areas, are currently facing a substantial double jeopardy. On one hand, they face significant disparity gaps - about 24 percentage points in less coverage - across a myriad of housing and living condition indicators. For some basic services like water, toilet and public sewage disposal, the gaps are as high as 40-50 percentage points. On the other hand, we were able to quantify for the first time the extent of rent premium - about 16 percent - that Nairobi's slum tenants are paying relative to their formal area counterparts, after adjusting for housing quality conditions. While our study's primary goal was on demonstrating the presence and the extent of the double jeopardy, it also sheds important insights from normative policy perspectives. A novel insight here is that although formal tenure agreements are rare in Nairobi's slums, the tenants do pay a rent premium of about 18 percent if they possess such agreements.

Income-based charges such as resource rent taxes have been advocated on the theory that royalties and other output-based charges create inefficiency by distorting production decisions. Using a principal-agent approach to resource contracts, separating asset ownership from asset use, we demonstrate that royalties can be efficient under conditions of certainty and also when there is uncertainty and asymmetric information.

Retailers are figures from whom farmers purchase seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. The article traces the rise of village-level retailers in western Maharashtra, India, since the 1990s, and finds that Maratha (a dominant landholding cultivator caste) households have ventured into retailing. Further, farmers depend on retailers for credit, technical knowledge, and for the sale of their harvest. By analysing the pressures and risks of petty retail, visible in interactions with farmers, the article argues that even as retailing provides avenues for upward mobility to petty agricultural commodity producers, the trade is too volatile for the gains to sustain. Thus, the entry of Marathas into petty retail is akin to an attempt at class differentiation but without consolidation.","[Aga, Aniket] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Aga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aniket.aga.2016@gmail.com,,,"Wenner-Gren Foundation [8726]; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation [1324382]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1324382] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Wenner-Gren Foundation; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Wenner-Gren Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 8726; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1324382",,60,24,26,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Theoretical research suggests that money managers' short-term focus stems from their career concerns and greater fund transparency can amplify these concerns. Using a difference-in-differences design around a regulatory shock that increased the transparency of fund managers' portfolio choices, we examine whether increased transparency encourages myopic corporate investment behavior. We find that corporate innovation declines following the regulatory shock. Moreover, evidence from mutual fund trading behavior corroborates that the increased short-term focus of money managers drives the results.","[Agarwal, Vikas] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, 35 Broad St,Suite 1234, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Vashishtha, Rahul; Venkatachalam, Mohan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Duke University,"Agarwal, V (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, 35 Broad St,Suite 1234, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",vagarwal@gsu.edu,"Agarwal, Vikas/AAR-5706-2020","Agarwal, Vikas/0000-0002-9099-8542","Fuqua School of Business; J.

Hence, monetary policy can directly affect the liquidity and balance sheet strength of firms through existing loans. We show that firms-especially financially constrained firms-with more unhedged loans display a stronger sensitivity of their stock price, cash holdings, inventory, and fixed capital investment to monetary policy. This effect disappears when policy rates are at the zero lower bound, revealing a new limitation of unconventional monetary policy. The floating-rate channel is at least as important as the bank lending channel operating through new loans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that national culture affects corporate investment efficiency through the level of secrecy that national culture exhibits. Using a sample of firms from eight culturally-diverse European Union countries, we find that the level of secrecy that national culture exhibits is negatively related to corporate investment efficiency after controlling for a number of firm-and country-level factors. We also find that the negative relation between national culture and corporate investment efficiency is mitigated by an exogenous shock to the information asymmetry problem between managers and investors. Our study highlights the importance of the cultural value of secrecy/transparency as a determinant of investment efficiency at the firm-level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations. Our results are relevant to the current policy discussions on new regulatory framework to deal with systemic events of distress as well as on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.

German law mandates that firms' supervisory boards consist of an equal number of employees' and owners' representatives. This requirement, however, applies only to firms with more than two thousand domestic employees. We exploit this discontinuity and the law's introduction in 1976 for identification and find that direct employee power increases financial leverage. This is explained by a supply side effect: as banks' interests are similar to those of employees, higher employee power reduces agency conflicts with debt providers, leading to better financing conditions. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of direct employee influence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While these programs typically work with a limited group of beneficiaries, little is known about the potential community impact beyond these beneficiaries. To investigate this, we empirically analyze how cooperative behavior develops in a lab-in-the-field experiment with mixed groups of CDR program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, organized in 42 municipalities in Colombia with active CDR programs. In the experiment, we use two rounds of a binary public goods game with a communication stage between both rounds. The experimental data are complemented with information on pre-existing social proximity among the participants and whether they have participated in a CDR program. We find that cooperation increases after communication, and that it correlates positively with the proportion of cooperators before communication. This peer effect is mainly driven by the cooperative behavior of CDR program beneficiaries while the influence of non-beneficiaries is limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Given that stock return volatility measures risk, if the gridlock argument holds, stock market volatility should be lower under divided than under a unified government. Using a partisan conflict index (PCI), we empirically confirm this theoretical argument for the U.S. stock market based on quantiles-based regressions. In particular, quantile-on-quantile regressions show that PCI tends to predict reduced volatility, with the effect being stronger at levels of volatility that are moderately low (i.e., below the median, but not at its extreme) for an increase in the predictor, especially with moderately low and high initial values (i.e., when PCI is at quantiles around the median).","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Tunis, Campus Univ,Ave 7 Novembre, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University; Universite de Tunis; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; c.pierdzioch@hsu-hh.de; s.refk@yahoo.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,25,38,40,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

In a simple DSGE model, we show analytically that more flexible prices always amplify output volatility for supply shocks and also amplify output volatility for demand shocks if monetary policy does not respond strongly to inflation.

Darfur once commanded global attention but has receded into the shadows of a world suffering from compassion fatigue. This study was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The first is the growing interest in environmental performance within illiberal regimes. I contend that understanding the situation in authoritarian and heavily conflict-ridden societies such as Darfur region in Sudan requires a combined holistic and historical framework for understanding the complex interplay of political economy and cultural ecology affecting local use and management of natural resources. The second concern is a desire to reflect on the possibilities and challenges of peace-building and recovery Darfur, drawing on my experience there with two projects carried out by the Near East Foundation that sought to promote early recovery in Central Darfur through environmental peacebuilding. Its preparation was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The third concern is to address some of the links between peacebuilding and natural resource interventions. I argue that even in extremely illiberal settings such as Darfur that it is still possible to carry out activities that widen the scope for action by local populations. This finding was most evident regarding the project's conflict management training, which local people ended up applying in a range of situations, and which helped spawn a peace movement among youths. Nevertheless, project participants noted that this training and action, while helpful at the community level, could not address bigger problems outside.

THE UNEASY CASE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TAX,NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,broad-based; low-rate taxation; comprehensive income; Haig-Simons standard; optimal taxation; tax reform,OPTIMAL TAXATION; PUBLIC PRODUCTION; RATES,"Discussions of the ideal form of individual income taxation have largely been based on some variant of the standard suggested by Haig (1921) and Simons (1938). This Haig-Simons (H-S) standard argues that an ideal income tax should be imposed on comprehensive income, and the H-S standard has been used to justify the frequently heard call for a Broad-based, Low-rate tax reform strategy. However I argue in this paper that a truly comprehensive individual income tax has in fact never been fully applied, either in the design of a new income tax or in the reform of an existing one. Indeed, my first conclusion is that the H-S standard is effectively dead in terms of its actual real-world relevance to income tax design or reform. This conclusion obviously does not demonstrate that the H-S standard should be discarded as the basis for an ideal individual income tax, including any reform of the income tax. However, my second conclusion is that the death of the H-S standard is entirely appropriate; that is, there are compelling arguments that can be made for an individual income tax that is in fact imposed on an even narrower tax base, with even more extensive use of the many exclusions, adjustments, deductions, and exemptions that currently populate most all income taxes. Even so, my final conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all income tax standard; that is, any standard must consider the specifics of the current environment, especially the underlying goals of taxation.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,6,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The GDP forecasts cover 63 countries for the years 1992-2014. The main finding is that, while forecasters are generally aware that recession years will be different from other years, they miss the magnitude of the recession by a wide margin until the year is almost over. Forecasts during non-recession years are revised slowly; in recession years, the pace of revision picks up but not sufficiently to avoid large forecast errors. Our second finding is that forecasts of the private sector and the official sector are virtually identical; thus, both are equally good at missing recessions.

Furthermore, Japan anticipates significant increases in future government expenditures due to an aging population. These problems have led Japan to introduce a consumption tax rate in an attempt to raise revenues, and, more recently, to reduce the statutory corporate income tax rate to raise investment and output growth. In this paper we study the growth and welfare consequences of a reduction in income taxation in Japan along with increases in consumption taxation to stabilize the debt to output ratio. In particular, we consider various unanticipated tax reforms using the model described in Hansen and imrohoroglu (2016). We find that while output per working age population is projected to be roughly constant between 2015 and 2021 in the benchmark equilibrium representing the status quo, under alternative policies considered, output could be as much as 15% higher by 2021.","[Hansen, Gary] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Imrohoroglu, Selahattin] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Southern California,"Imrohoroglu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ghansen@econ.ucla.edu; selo@marshall.usc.edu,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,20,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1583,1095-8681,,J JPN INT ECON,J.

The present article reports the results of an experiment to test if communicating social purpose enhances investment appeal and the neurophysiological mechanism through which this effect occurs. By connecting physiological and behavioral responses to microfinance requests for 101 participants, we found that investments with a social purpose, compared with those that were self-focused, received 25% more loans. Social purpose requests were associated with a significant reduction in two measures of physiologic arousal, resulted in greater empathic concern, and produced stronger negative affect compared with self-focused requests. These factors were largely driven by responses by women, who invested 90% more money to requests overall and 97% more to social purpose requests than did men. Our findings indicate that communicating social purpose is an effective way to attract more investment to entrepreneurs in developing countries.","[Kraig, Adriana; Terris, Elizabeth T.; Barraza, Jorge A.; Zak, Paul J.] Claremont Grad Univ, Ctr Neuroecon Studies, 160 East 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Cornelis, Cosette] St Georges Univ, Sch Med, True Blue Point, Grenada; [Neubert, Mitchell J.] Baylor Univ, Dept Management, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Wood, Matthew S.] Baylor Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Baylor University; Baylor University,"Zak, PJ (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Ctr Neuroecon Studies, 160 East 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",paul.zak@cgu.edu,"Wood, Matthew/HDN-1469-2022",,"National Science Foundation [0925907]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0925907] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant 0925907 to Mitchell J.

We find that the CEE transition economies have generally increased their world export competitiveness, but gains in market share have been tempered by a poor match between both the commodity and regional export profiles of most of the CEE economies and the changes in the world impost profile, and by generally slow adaptation of the region to changes in the latter on both the commodity and regional dimensions. Changes in export competitiveness in the region overall are instead driven largely by expansions of market share within the EU. Using a new method we show that only a small proportion of the change in the trade share is attributable to changes in the extensive margin.

We identify firms in distress among all listed firms based on accounting data, and we separately identify firms undergoing corporate restructuring based on a newspaper search for the Japanese term saiken. Even though the ratio of distressed firms has not declined, the incidence of saiken restructuring by such firms has become less frequent after the 1990s, indicating a decline in the governance and rescue role of the main bank. When firms undergo saiken, they adopt real adjustments in terms of labor, assets and finance. While the intensity of these adjustments has also declined over time, saiken firms make more significant adjustments than distressed firms that do not undergo restructuring. The role of saiken was an important part of corporate renewal in Japan, and it has declined. In line with existing research, these findings underscore changes in Japanese corporate governance, in particular regarding the decline of the monitoring and restructuring function of the main bank.","[Hoshi, Takeo] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hoshi, Takeo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Koibuchi, Satoshi] Chuo Univ, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Schaede, Ulrike] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Chuo University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hoshi, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Hoshi, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tkohoshi@stanford.edu,,,Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office of Japan,Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office of Japan,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 26th TRIO Conference held at The University of Tokyo, June 22,2017.

The paper shows how competitive versus team incentives compare in motivating Ugandan farmers to learn and share information relevant to adopting a new agricultural technology. We find that tournament-based incentives provide greater outcomes in terms of total information learned than threshold-based team incentives. Furthermore the order of the incentive - whether the tournament precedes or follows the team incentive scheme - does not affect the volume of information learned. New information introduced between rounds was learned by more individuals under team incentives than under tournament incentives. The study provides direct practical policy recommendations for improving learning in the context of agriculture in Uganda. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we discuss the most policy-relevant results of the study, mindful of the strengths and weaknesses of current models. Across all models, carbon prices lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions and conventional pollutants, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector. Importantly, emissions reductions do not significantly depend on the rebate or tax cut used to return revenues to the economy. Expected economic costs, as modeled by either GDP or welfare, are modest, but vary across models. These costs are offset by benefits from avoided climate damages and health benefits from reductions in conventional air pollution. Using revenues to reduce preexisting capital or labor taxes reduces costs in most models relative to lump-sum rebates, but the size of the cost reductions varies significantly. Devoting at least some revenue to household rebates can significantly reduce adverse impacts on low income households. Carbon prices at $25/ton or even lower levels cause significant shifts away from coal as an energy source with responses of other energy sources highly dependent upon technology cost assumptions. Beyond 2030, we conclude that model uncertainties are too large to make quantitative results useful for near-term policy design. We close by describing recommendations for policymakers on interacting with model results in the future.","[Barron, Alexander R.] Smith Coll, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 44 Coll Lane, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Fawcett, Allen A.; McFarland, James R.] US EPA, 1200 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Hafstead, Marc A.

SDG5 also recognizes the value of women's economic empowerment, entailing equal rights to economic resources and full participation at all levels in economic decisions. Also according to SDG5, eliminating harmful practices such as child marriage before age 18 is a prerequisite for women's economic empowerment. Using national data for 4,129 married women 15-43 years who took part in the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 1998-2012), we performed autoregressive, cross lagged panel analyses to assess whether women's first marriage in adulthood (at 18 years or older, as reported in 2006), was positively associated with their long-term post-marital economic empowerment, measured as their engagement in market work and latent family economic agency in 2012. Women's first marriage in adulthood had positive unadjusted associations with their market work and family economic agency in 2012. These associations persisted after accounting for market work and family economic agency in 2006, pre-marital resources for empowerment, and cumulative fertility.

The results indicate that the duration of most trade relationships is very short, and shorter than what is normally reported in the literature. Still, the substantial variation in duration by product form and factors influencing it, indicates heterogeneous dynamics for each supply chain even for slight differences in the characteristics of a commodity. Moreover, the short duration of trade relationships in the supply chains for Norwegian cod indicates that they remain very traditional food supply chains, with few attempts at reducing transaction costs through vertical coordination or relationships.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forestry Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank; Cojocaru, Andreea L.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Gaasland, Ivar; Straume, Hans-Martin] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; BI Norwegian Business School,"Straume, HM (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.",frank.asche@ufl.edu; andreea.cojocaru@uis.no; ivar.gaasland@bi.no; hans-martin.straume@bi.no,"Cojocaru, Andreea/AAN-6033-2021; Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Cojocaru, Andreea L./0000-0003-0210-4113; Straume, Hans-Martin/0000-0002-6431-4418","Research Council of Norway [233836, 233751]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Thanks to two reviewers for helpful comments.

We study a model of electoral competition with rationally ignorant voters in which the success of a reform is tied to a politician's unobservable competence. We show that when voters' demand for reform is high, candidates engage in a form of populism and propose reformist agendas regardless of their ability to successfully carry them out. As voters are then faced with either risky reformers or policy inaction, the relationship between demand for reform and the probability that any (i.e., genuine or populist) policy change is implemented depends on how harmful botched reforms are. Our results help organize the mixed empirical evidence regarding the impact of crises on the likelihood of reform. They also suggest that the rise of populism may cause political disenchantment rather than the other way round.","[Prato, Carlo] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wolton, Stephane] London Sch Econ, London, England",Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Prato, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cp2928@columbia.edu; s.wolton@lse.ac.uk,,"Wolton, Stephane/0000-0003-1405-650X",Hoover Institution,Hoover Institution,"We thank two anonymous referees, Avidit Acharya, Scott Ashworth, Laurent Bouton, Renee Bowen, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Peter Buisseret, Micael Castanheira, Allan Drazen, Justin Fox, Navin Kartik, Pablo Montagnes, Roger Myerson, Larry Samuelson, Francesco Squintani, Dustin Tingley, Gabriel Ulysses, Richard Van Weelden, seminar participants at APSA, MPSA, Princeton, University of Chicago, Collegio Carlo Alberto, University of Mannheim, University of Oslo, SCARES, Stockholm School of Economics, and EITM Institute for helpful comments, as well as Kate Anthony and Richard Jung for excellent research assistance.

Systematic overinvestment arises from the positional-good characteristic of residential land investment, but this effect vanishes when the positional-good indicator is removed.

Against this backdrop, there has been substantial penetration of mobile money, moving beyond simple person-to-person exchanges towards adoption by private firms. This study explores whether there is a relationship between firm adoption of mobile money and firm investment. Using firm-level data that are nationally representative of the private sector in three East African countries-Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda-a positive relationship is found between mobile money use and firm's purchase of fixed assets. This relationship is attributed to reduced transaction costs, increased liquidity, and increased credit worthiness associated with the use of mobile phone financial services.

We use a single framework encompassing capital, labour and energy taxes. Our cross-country/cross-sector approach allows us to analyse the contributions of these input factors to the effective tax borne by firms, taking explicitly into account their degree of substitution, their tax incidence and the role of mark-ups. We find that the labour tax plays a particularly important role in the overall level of the EMTR and that the presence of mark-ups can significantly alter the levels of the multi-factor EMTR, although without significantly altering the ranking of countries.

In this paper, we describe the evolution of this market in the UK. Using an inductive qualitative longitudinal research design, we analyse the emerging views of entrepreneurs and investors towards ECF. Our interviewees include large and small-scale investors, as well as market participants who have chosen not to invest or raise funds via ECF. We find that the large financial flows to entrepreneurs in the UK via the ECF platforms, nearly half a billion GBP since 2011, have probably been largely incremental to traditional sources of early stage entrepreneurial finance. Moreover, our research indicates that for the most part, investors appear to understand and appropriately evaluate the risks that they are bearing; ECF investments are perceived as a high risk, high return component within individuals' portfolios. Investors also use their communication with peers and entrepreneurs via the ECF platform as a learning tool. On the entrepreneurs' side, ECF allows them to test their products, to develop their brand, to build a loyal customer base and to turn customers into investors. We conclude that policymakers, with the support of a locally appropriate regulatory framework, could support equity crowdfunding as one of the market choices available for entrepreneurs looking to start or grow their ventures.","[Estrin, Saul; Khavul, Susanna] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gozman, Daniel] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Whiteknights Reading, England; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Lucas Coll, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Khavul, Susanna] San Jose State Univ, Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Sydney; University of Reading; California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University,"Estrin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk; daniel.gozman@gmail.com; susanna.khavul@sjsu.edu,"Gozman, Daniel/JDC-4259-2023; estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","Gozman, Daniel/0000-0002-7399-9201; estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",EU Horizon 2020 programme [649378]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EU Horizon 2020 programme(Horizon 2020); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the research assistance from Lolo Chen, Linde de Nie, Mary Fox, Ioanna Gouseti, Andrea Guerini-Rocco, Ines Steimelweger and Dustin Voss.

Existing econometric studies are not able to separately identify the impacts of heat and water stress because higher temperatures cause damages through both mechanisms. To resolve the identification problem, I introduce measures of water deficit and water surplus into a regression analysis that estimates the nonlinear impacts of heat and water stress on nonirrigated rental rates in the central United States. The results indicate rental rate losses of 33% ($9.5 billion annually) by mid-century due to climate change in scenario RCP 4.5. I find that 65% of the projected damages are due to heat stress, 32% due to increasing water deficit, and 3% due to increasing water surplus. However, the source of damages varies spatially.","[Hendricks, Nathan P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Hendricks, NP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nph@ksu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [EPS-0903806]; state of Kansas through Kansas Board of Regents,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); state of Kansas through Kansas Board of Regents,"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award no.

We show that a tariff determined by the current level of accumulated pollution can induce the time path of emissions optimal for the downstream (polluted) country. But if the upstream (polluting) country can lobby the downstream government to impose lower tariffs, distortions brought by corruption and foreign lobbying lead to a rise in the upstream country's social welfare, and to a decrease in social welfare in the downstream country. Thus, the usefulness of trade policy as a tool for encouraging cooperation and internalizing transboundary externalities depends critically on the degree of governments' susceptibility to foreign political influence.","[Mason, Charles F.; Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Umanskaya, Victoria I.] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Occidental College,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Mason, CF (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173",,,,,44,6,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

More recently, studies have looked at the role of gender diversity as a possible determinant of innovation and entrepreneurial performance. However, the relationship between gender and employment growth-a dimension of entrepreneurial performance-still remains unexplored to a large degree. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on gender and entrepreneurial performance in several ways. First, it examines the role played by both innovation and gender ownership as determinants of employment growth rates of young, knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial (KIE) firms. Second, it investigates the indirect impact of contributing factors-such as the characteristics of the market, knowledge-based capital, and human capital-on employment growth. And third, it relies on a rich new cross-sectional data set on young, KIE firms across European Union (EU) countries. The data set contains information not only on the gender of the firm's founders but also on the market environment, business strategy, and innovative and economic performance of firms.","[Amoroso, Sara] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Link, Albert N.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, 461 Bryan Bldg, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Amoroso, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",sara.amoroso@ec.europa.eu; anlink@uncg.edu,"Amoroso, Sara/L-7179-2014","Amoroso, Sara/0000-0001-5835-079X",European Commission under Theme 8 Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,European Commission under Theme 8 Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development,"The authors wish to thank the AEGIS consortium for providing data of the AEGIS survey which supported the empirical investigation of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship in Europe in different sectoral, country, and socioeconomic contexts.

This spread predominantly reflects the poorer liquidity of TIPS relative to nominal Treasury securities.

J,"Gavin, WT",,,,"Gavin, William T.",,,Monetary Policy Regimes and the Real Interest Rate,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"During the period from 1965 to the end of 2015, the Federal Reserve operated monetary policy in a variety of ways associated with four distinct monetary policy regimes. These different monetary policy regimes display different outcomes for inflation, interest rates, and real consumption growth. This article uses the differences among the outcomes to better understand how monetary policy affects those outcomes. One of the important results is that monetary policy appears to be able to affect long-term real interest rates and real consumption growth during periods of extreme monetary policy in which the Fed holds short-term interest rates abnormally high or abnormally low for an extended period. This article exploits the idea of monetary policy regimes to ask whether monetary policy exacerbated the low real interest rate on safe assets and the low level of consumption during the period in which the range for the Fed's interest rate target was set at 0 to 0.25 percent. Many observers have appealed to real factors such as aging demographics to explain the low level of long-term interest rates. The evidence presented here suggests that policy analysts should also consider the possibility that the Fed was the main cause of the low real interest rate following the 2007-08 financial crisis.","[Gavin, William T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Gavin, WT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

However, the maturity of startups that apply for funding (and are ultimately funded) inversely correlates with the entrepreneurship-friendliness of the country.

The enrichment perspective was operationalized as family instrumental (financial) and affective (moral) support, while interference was operationalized as gender-related personal problems. Design/methodology/approach - The study drew upon the work-family interface (WFI) theory from the family embeddedness perspective in the context of institutional economics. In Morocco, a purposive sample of 116 women entrepreneurs completed a self-administered questionnaire using field collection, mail, and phone surveying methods. In Turkey, 147 women entrepreneurs completed the questionnaire online and through personal contacts in business organizations. Findings - The findings indicated a positive relationship of family financial support with business performance of female entrepreneurs in Morocco, a less economically advanced country. However, family moral support is related to better firm performance in Turkey, a more advanced economy. Gender-related personal problems of women entrepreneurs appear to hamper their business performance in Turkey; while in Morocco, the performance of women entrepreneurs seems to improve in the face of such impediments. Practical implications - The results provide initial evidence that female entrepreneurs benefit from the linkages of family-to-business enrichment in different ways, depending on the country's level of economic development. In less economically developed countries, women entrepreneurs benefit more from instrumental rather than affective components of the enrichment dimension of the BFI. Conversely, in more economically advanced countries, female entrepreneurs benefit more from affective rather than the instrumental elements of this dimension. Likewise, the components of the interference dimension of the BFI affect female entrepreneurs differently depending on the economic development of the countries. Women in the less-developed country of Morocco are less impeded by their personal problems compared to their counterparts in Turkey, a more developed economy. Actually, Moroccan women entrepreneurs improved their business performance when facing obstacles, most likely due to their increased inner strength and resilience acquired when battling adversarial institutional conditions. Originality/value - The present study makes three unique contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, the study links the two BFI dimensions (enrichment and interference) to firm performance with an exclusive focus on female business owners. Second, within the construct of enrichment, the study employs both family instrumental and emotional support. Third, the study shows that the country's level of economic development moderates the relationships between the BFI dimensions and firm performance.","[Welsh, Dianne H.

From a firm-level dataset covering 51 developed and developing countries for 1989 through 2013, we find that in countries with stronger creditor rights, firms tend to have higher credit ratings. We confirm that in these countries, firms with higher credit ratings exhibit a greater issuance of public debt than that of equity. As further evidence that credit ratings reduce agency costs of debt, we find that improvements in creditor rights and resulting higher credit ratings increase capital expenditures among firms experiencing severe bondholder-shareholder conflicts.

To investigate this, we run several experiments where people bet on propositions (facts) that they cannot recall with certainty. We use betting preferences to infer subjects' revealed beliefs and their revealed confidence in these beliefs. Forgetting is induced via interference tasks and time delays (up to one year). We observe a natural memory decay pattern where beliefs become less accurate and confidence is reduced as well. Moreover, we find a form of comparative ignorance where subjects are more ambiguity averse when they cannot recall the truth rather than never having learnt it. In a different vein, we identify an overconfidence pattern: on average, subjects overpay for bets on propositions that they believe in, but underpay for the opposite bets. We formulate a two-signal behavioral model of forgetting that generates all of these patterns. It suggests new testable hypotheses that are confirmed by our data.","[Kopylov, Igor] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Miller, Joshua] Univ Alicante, FAE, Alicante, Spain",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universitat d'Alacant,"Kopylov, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",ikopylov@uci.edu; Joshua.Benjamin.Miller@gmail.com,,"MILLER, JOSHUA BENJAMIN/0000-0001-8412-3689",,,,,39,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

A winner-loser portfolio approach shows that return seasonality is economically significant in advanced markets but not in emerging markets. We conduct statistical, rational and behavioral analyses to explore the potential reasons for the seasonality observed in advanced markets and find that regression bias, the January effect, and the Fama-French-Carhart type risk premium all can partially explain this seasonality difference.","[Li, Fengyun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Fengyun] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huacheng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Dazhi] West Chester Univ, W Chester, PA USA",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania,"Zhang, HC (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhanghuacheng1@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,12,13,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

We then provide empirical evidence of moral hazard in home energy retrofits in Florida. We find that for those measures, the quality of which is deemed hard to observe, realized energy savings are subject to day-of-the-week effects. Specifically, energy savings are significantly lower when those measures were installed on a Fridaya day particularly prone to negative shocks on workers' productivitythan on any other weekday.

We find that, in poor countries, increases in agricultural productivity generally have a larger poverty-reduction effect than increases in industry or services. This differential declines as average incomes rise, partly because agriculture becomes smaller as a share of the economy, and partly because agricultural productivity growth becomes less effective in reducing poverty. The source of the poverty reduction benefits from agricultural productivity growth changes as innovations are more widely adopted moving from increases in producer returns to reductions in consumer prices.

These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, we find that smaller, more profitable, and highly liquid Islamic banks are more highly capitalized. Additionally, improvements in the economic and financial environments and market discipline within a country correspond with higher Islamic bank capitalization. The results shed light on the impact that Sharia'a law restrictions have on Islamic banking capitalization. Our findings are most robust to banks that choose to hold capital well in excess of that required by regulators, consistent with traditional capital structure theory. Our results highlight the role that stable economic and political systems play in improving bank capitalization and reducing financial sector risk. By reducing political instability and corruption, improving legal systems, and encouraging access to capital markets, policymakers may incentivize managers to make financing decisions that increase the capitalization of the Islamic banking industry in developing countries.

There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks' dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank's default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors' creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We study this issue quantitatively in a small New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which the risk of financial crises depends on excess credit.'' We compare monetary policy rules responding to the output gap to rules that respond to excess credit. We find that responding to credit can lead to a lower average probability of financial crisis, at the cost of higher cyclical volatility in inflation and output.

The Fed was established to bring an end to the frequent crises that plagued the U.S. banking system, which reform proponents attributed to the nation's inelastic currency stock and dependence on interbank relationships to allocate liquidity and operate the payments system. Reform advocates noted that banking panics tended to occur at times of the year when the demands for currency and bank loans were normally at seasonal peaks and money markets were at their tightest. Moreover, they blamed the interbank system, upon which the banking system depended for seasonal accommodation and interregional payments, for transmitting shocks throughout the banking system. The article finds that after the Fed's founding, country national banks were much less dependent on correspondent banks for seasonal liquidity and that peaks in lending by individual Reserve Banks aligned with the liquidity needs of banks in their districts. Further, the article shows that after the Fed's founding, banks generally were less liquid and relied more heavily on deposits for funding, consistent with the idea that banks viewed the Fed as a reliable source of liquidity. The return of banking panics during the Great Depression, however, showed that the Fed was not, in fact, up to the challenge of serving as a full-fledged lender of last resort.","[Carlson, Mark] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Carlson, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,"Wheelock, David C/I-5757-2016","Carlson, Mark/0000-0002-9261-9702",,,,,33,1,2,0,1,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We estimate two types of synergies: i) the complementarity between SCTP and FISP, that is whether the impact of both interventions run together is larger than the sum of the impacts of these interventions when run separately, and ii) the incremental impact of receiving FISP when a household already receives SCTP, as well as the incremental impact of receiving SCTP when a household already receives FISP.

Both mandates were first enacted at the state level but have been studied only in isolation. We estimate a wide range of models allowing these mandates to have joint effects on insurance coverage, health-care access, health outcomes and fertility. We provide new evidence that helps settle the mixed findings from past state-level YAD and CM research and suggests the two mandates may combine to improve the well-being of young adults.

We estimate that approximately 586 million people with high infant mortality live in LFAAs and 85 million with high infant mortality live in rural LECZs, although both of these populations declined between 2000 and 2010. Nearly all of these people are in low-income or lower middle-income countries, with twenty countries accounting for most of the LFAA or rural LECZ populations with high infant mortality. We also examine the economic and environmental impacts of climate change on the rural poor in LFAAs and LECZs and discuss policy strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on poverty among rural households in LFAAs and LECZs.","[Barbier, Edward B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hochard, Jacob P.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Brewster Bldg A-427, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Hochard, Jacob P.] East Carolina Univ, ICSP, Flanagan Bldg Suite 250, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",Colorado State University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",edward.barbier@colostate.edu; Hochardj15@ecu.edu,,"Hochard, Jacob/0000-0002-9502-2602",,,,,65,48,56,3,554,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Employing a difference-in-difference estimator we find that the loan forgiveness component of the program was effective, reducing mean attrition rates for middle and high school math and science teachers by 10.4 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. We also find that the impact of loan forgiveness varied with the generosity of payments; when fully funded, the program reduced attrition of special education teachers by 12.3 percent, but did not have a statistically significant impact when funding was substantially reduced. A triple-difference estimate indicates that a one-time bonus program also had large effects, reducing the likelihood of teachers' exit by as much as 32 percent in the short run. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that both the loan forgiveness and the bonus program were cost effective.

The capabilities that he discusses are, for the most part, simply technologies that can be thought of as ordinary capabilities. Moreover, his approach isolates capability selection from strategy. Opportunities must be sensed and calibrated and a strategy developed before capability gaps can be identified. Pisano also treats general-purpose capabilities as an option without acknowledging their dependence on the stage of the industry lifecycle. In mature industries, general-purpose technologies are less likely to be relevant. While there is much of value in Pisano's article about technology selection and risk, this is overshadowed by the claims he makes for the magnitude of the article's contribution to dynamic capabilities research.","[Linden, Greg; Teece, David J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business 1930, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Linden, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business 1930, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",glinden@berkeley.edu; teece@haas.berkeley.edu,"Teece, David/A-2868-2013",,,,,,15,8,9,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We study the totality of information requests filed with Mexican federal government agencies from 2003 to 2015, over 1 million requests in all. We use unsupervised methods to categorize requests, revealing the diversity of topics including environment, security, budgets, and government procurement and employees. While many topics have clear public accountability-seeking purposes, others are focused on more private, micro-political goals. Analysis over time and across states reveals linkage between information demand and issues of public interest such as environmental impacts and criminal violence. Our results demonstrate that, given functioning access-to-information institutions, citizens in a transitional democracy really do demand information relevant to public accountability.

We distinguish close social networks (composed of friends and family) abroad and at the current location, and broad social networks (composed of same-country residents with intention to migrate, either internationally or locally). We find that social networks abroad are the most important driving forces of international migration intentions, with close and broad networks jointly explaining about 37% of variation in the probability intentions. Social networks are found to be more important factors driving migration intentions than work-related aspects or wealth (wealth accounts for less than 3% of the variation). In addition, we find that having stronger close social networks at home has the opposite effect by reducing the likelihood of migration intentions, both internationally and locally.

We propose a new index of occupation-level IT intensity and document several long-term changes in the occupational landscape over the past decades. Using Census and US KLEMS micro-data, we show that: (i) the bulk of productivity growth after 1950 is concentrated in IT intensive sectors; (ii) the share of workers in IT jobs has expanded significantly, with little or no pause and IT jobs enjoy a large and growing earnings premium, even after controlling for general task requirements (e.g., cognitive, non-routine); and (iii) the rise of the IT intensive employment share is closely associated with declines in the manufacturing employment share. While earnings premia for college-educated and cognitive/non-routine workers have flattened in the aggregate since 2000, we show that they continued growing in IT intensive jobs and that these jobs have played a key role in accounting for the surge of high tech service labor productivity. We also use our IT intensity index to estimate industry-specific elasticities of substitution between IT and non-IT intensive labor, finding values of 1.6 in manufacturing and 1.3 in services. Finally, we revisit a long-standing question about the relationship between technological progress and productivity and provide evidence that occupation-level IT intensity is positively associated with output growth, especially in the services sector.

This paper shows how employees in a large firm altered their fund allocations when the employer streamlined its pension fund menu and deleted nearly half of the offered funds. Using administrative data, we examine the changes in plan participant investment choices that resulted from the streamlining and how these changes might affect participants' eventual retirement wellbeing. We show that streamlined participants' new allocations exhibited significantly lower within-fund turnover rates and expense ratios, and we estimate this could lead to aggregate savings for these participants over a 20-year period of $20.2 M, or in excess of $9,400 per participant. Moreover, after the reform, streamlined participants' portfolios held significantly less equity and exhibited significantly lower risks by way of reduced exposures to most systematic risk factors, compared with their non-streamlined counterparts.","[Keim, Donald B.; Mitchell, Olivia S.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,2300 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Keim, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,2300 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",keim@wharton.upenn.edu; mitchelo@wharton.upenn.edu,,,TIAA Institute; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,TIAA Institute; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,"Research support for the analysis herein was provided by the TIAA Institute and by the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

We present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in Andhra Pradesh, India. The games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. These were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. A slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. Our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. Individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. Either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. After the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same NGO water commons program. Because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. However, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.

We exploit variation across counties and across time in teenagers' exposure to condom distribution programs in schools. We find that access to condoms in schools increases teen fertility by about 12 percent. The results suggest that the effects of condom access varied significantly across different programs; the positive fertility estimates are driven by communities where condoms are provided without mandated counseling.

We find that although the already declining futures pit trading decreased further after the pit closure, it has not completely disappeared. Execution costs, following the pit closure, appear to have increased for livestock futures and declined for treasury futures transactions on the electronic platform. We, also, find that pit users, who had been active in both trading venues, remain active in the electronic market. However, there is no evidence of pit traders (locals) transitioning to the electronic market. Nevertheless, some of them are still active in options pits. When we explore the changes in daily trading patterns, we observe an ongoing shift in the timing of trading hours for livestock futures, but we note that this shift is unlikely to be driven by the pit closure.","[Gousgounis, Eleni] Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Onur, Esen] US Commod Futures Trading Commiss, Washington, DC USA",Stevens Institute of Technology,"Gousgounis, E (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",eleni.gousgounis@stevens.edu,"Onur, Esen/GOV-3105-2022",,,,,,20,6,6,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Using exogenous variation in education from a compulsory schooling change combined with wealth data for the Swedish population, we estimate the effect of education on stock market participation and on the share of financial wealth invested in stocks, conditional on participation. For men, an extra year of education increases market participation by two percentage points and the share of financial wealth allocated to stocks by 10%. We find suggestive evidence that greater financial wealth is a potential channel through which education increases participation, consistent with the existence of fixed costs. Lower risk aversion is a potential channel through which education increases the stock share. The reform has less effect on female schooling attainment and there is no evidence that this additional education affects women's asset allocation.

In response to such private politics, firms seek to maintain political support in the localities in which they operate so that they can avoid conflict and secure access to resources. To secure local support and defuse opposition, some firms take actions that expand access to essential public goods, services, and economic opportunities, while others use targeted clientelistic benefits that reward only a few. What accounts for this variation? Answering this question is key to identifying the development consequences of private politics. This article explores this question through a study of multinational mining firms operating in Bolivia, drawing on qualitative data from interviews as well as an original household survey. It shows that the political structures and organization in the localities in which firms operate create distinct incentives for firms to distribute benefits in targeted or inclusive ways. This finding contributes to studies of the local politics of natural resources and firm responses to social contestation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comovements in these are examined at the household and village levels, combining satellite imagery and household (Nepal Living Standard Measurement Survey) data. Projections of the impact of economic growth based on Engel curves turn out to be highly inaccurate: forest conditions remained stable despite considerable growth in household consumption and income. Firewood collections at the village level remained stable, as effects of demographic growth were offset by substantial reductions in per household collections. Households substituted firewood by alternative energy sources, particularly when livestock and farm-based occupations declined in importance. Engel curve specifications which include household productive assets (a proxy for occupational patterns) provide more accurate predictions.

However, focal points remain largely outside the formal apparatus of game theory. This paper develops a model of play in 2 x 2 games where payoff differences determine what strategy players will perceive as salient and choose to play. The model uniquely predicts which outcome will emerge for virtually the entire class of 2 x 2 normal form games. For the subset of such games involving coordination and asymmetric payoffs, payoff differences identify focal outcomes and strategies in the same way shared social knowledge produces coordination in Schelling's symmetric games. The model characterizes situations when Nash equilibria are likely to be played, even in a one-shot interaction, and predicts which equilibrium will obtain in games containing more than one. It identifies other circumstances in which a non-equilibrium outcome will predominate. Finally, the theory specifies when a player is likely to select a strategy based solely on consideration of her own payoffs, and when and why the same player will be prompted to act strategically. Experimental results are presented that test the predictions of the model.","[Leland, Jonathan W.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Social & Econ Sci, 2415 Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA; [Schneider, Mark] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA",National Science Foundation (NSF); Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Leland, JW (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Fdn, Div Social & Econ Sci, 2415 Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA.",jonathanwardleland@gmail.com; schneide@chapman.edu,,"Leland, Jonathan/0000-0002-4879-0238",,,,,35,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

First, for all the regions the impact of global factors on the sovereign bond spreads is more intense than regional factors. Second, the findings confirm that for the bond spreads of each region over its domestic government bonds, the countries' local fundamentals are better determinants of the spreads compared to the spread over US government bonds as a safe haven. Third, the influence of worldwide factors in the Eurozone compared to other regions bond spreads is less. Fourth, the relationship of the market sentiment and the investor risk aversion with the sovereign bond spreads of all regions is positive.

Together with a handful of other countries, Ghana offers the opportunity to analyze the distributional changes in the past two decades, since four comparable household surveys are available. In addition, unlike many other countries in SSA, Ghana's rapid growth translated into fast poverty reduction. A closer look at the distributional changes that occurred in the same period, however, suggests less optimism. The present paper develops an innovative methodology to analyze the distributional changes that occurred and their drivers, with a high degree of accuracy and granularity. Looking at the results from 1991 to 2012, the paper documents how the distributional changes over time hollowed out the middle of the Ghanaian household consumption distribution and increased the concentration of households around the highest and lowest deciles; there was a clear surge in polarization indeed. When looking at the drivers of polarization, household characteristics, educational attainment, and access to basic infrastructure all tended to increase over time the size of the upper and lower tails of the consumption distribution and, as a consequence, the degree of polarization.

Price trends in natural hazard zones may shift significantly and abruptly after a disaster signalling structural systemic changes in property markets. It challenges accurate market assessments of property prices and capital at risk after major disasters. A rigorous prediction of property prices in this case should ideally be done based only on the most recent sales, which are likely to form a rather small dataset. Hedonic analysis has been long used to understand how various factors contribute to the housing price formation. Yet, the robustness of its assessment is undermined when the analysis needs to be performed on relatively small samples. The purpose of this study is to suggest a model that can be widely applicable and quickly calibrated in a changing environment. We systematically study four statistical models: starting from a typical standard hedonic function and gradually changing its functional specification by reducing the hedonic analysis to some basic property characteristics and applying kriging to control for neighbourhood effects. Across different sample sizes we find that the latter performs consistently better in the out-of-sample predictions than other traditional price prediction methods. We present the specific improvements to the traditional spatial hedonic model that enhance the model's prediction accuracy. The improved model can be used to monitor price changes in risk-prone areas, accounting for changes in flood risk and at the same time controlling for autonomous market responses to flood risk.","[de Koning, Koen; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bin, Okmyung] East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Ctr Nat Hazards Res, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of Twente; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"de Koning, K (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",k.dekoning@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl; BINO@ecu.edu,"Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",,,,,43,10,10,4,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Rising obesity rates are the result of changes in people's diets and lifestyles. Income growth and urbanization are factors that contribute to these changes. Modernizing food retail environments may also play a certain role. For instance, the rapid spread of supermarkets in many developing countries could affect consumer food choices and thus nutritional outcomes. However, concrete evidence about the effects of supermarkets on consumer diets and nutrition is thin. A few existing studies have analyzed related linkages with cross-sectional survey data. We add to this literature by using panel data from households and individuals in urban Kenya. Employing panel regression models with individual fixed effects and controlling for other factors we show that shopping in supermarkets significantly increases body mass index (BMI). We also analyze impact pathways. Shopping in supermarkets contributes to higher consumption of processed and highly processed foods and lower consumption of unprocessed foods. These results confirm that the retail environment affects people's food choices and nutrition. However, the effects depend on the types of foods offered. Rather than thwarting modernization in the retail sector, policies that incentivize the sale of more healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables in supermarkets may be more promising to promote desirable nutritional outcomes.

By changing the nominal rate the central bank influences the liquidity premium, and hence the cost of taking leverage. Lower nominal rates make liquidity cheaper and raise leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth.

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) adaptive preferences, in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them.

This paper presents a cotton fund that consists of a set of contracts credit, insurance, warrant and forward - that enables producers to tackle specific agricultural risks and gain access to market finance. These financial contracts proved to be successful at guaranteeing the fund as issuer of state-contingent debt securities in the capital markets. The fund, as an intermediary, lent to cooperatives to help finance small cotton producers in northern Argentina. The paper explains the experimental design of this innovative fund and presents a potential alternative to government intervention by moving away from ex post subsidies for small producers and, instead, facilitating ex ante private credit.

Our concept of bank survival is derived from Stigler (1958) and includes any bank that does not fail or is not acquired. We define traditional banking by four hallmark characteristics: relationship loans, core deposit funding, revenue streams from traditional banking services, and physical bank branches. Banks that adhered more closely to this business strategy were an estimated 8 to 13 percentage points more likely to survive from 1997 to 2012 compared to other small banks using less traditional business strategies.

First, by augmenting a double differencing approach with a research design with three ingredients (a common set of companies simultaneously listed on two stock exchanges, binding capital controls, and different timing of changes in transaction costs), we obtain a control group that has identical corporate fundamentals as the treatment group. We apply the research design to Chinese stocks that are cross-listed in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Second, we allow transaction costs to have different effects in markets with different maturity. We find a significantly negative relationship, on average, between stamp duty increase and price volatility. However, this average effect masks some important heterogeneity. In particular, when institutional investors have become a significant part of the traders' pool, we find an opposite effect. Overall, our results suggest that a Tobin tax could work in an immature market, but can backfire in a more developed market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This implementation of the largest social pension program in the world offers a unique setting for studying the economics of intergenerational relationships during development, given the rapidity of China's population aging, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level. We draw on rich household surveys from two provinces at distinct development stages - impoverished Guizhou and relatively well-off Shandong - to better understand heterogeneity in the impact of pension benefits. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that around the pension eligibility age cut-off, the NRPS significantly reduces intergenerational co-residence, especially between elderly parents and their adults sons; promotes pensioners' healthcare service consumption; and weakens (but does not supplant) non-pecuniary and pecuniary transfers across three generations. These effects are much larger in less developed Guizhou province. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

England voted strongly to leave Europe while Scotland backed remain by 62% to 38%. The Scottish government published its draft bill on a second independence referendum in October 2016. The move does not mean another referendum will definitely be held, but this does raise the possibility that Scotland might choose independence and staying in the EU without the rest of the United Kingdom. If Scotland charts a course of independence from the rest of the United Kingdom, then they would likely either issue their own currency or join or form another currency area. In this paper, we test the microeconomic foundations of a common currency area for Scotland, United Kingdom, and the rest of the United Kingdom without Scotland. We find that the United Kingdom, Scotland, and the United Kingdom without Scotland all meet the microeconomic criteria for a common currency area. In contrast, banking data suggest that lending in Scotland is different from lending in the rest of the United Kingdom, adding some doubt to the issue of whether or not Scotland is a common currency area with the United Kingdom.","[Binner, Jane M.; Chaudhry, Sajid M.; Mullineux, Andrew W.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Swofford, James L.] Univ S Alabama, Mobile, AL USA",University of Birmingham; University of South Alabama,"Binner, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Chaudhry, Sajid/0000-0001-8769-8920",,,,,19,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We ask whether agricultural growth in developing countries increases the expenditures of poorer households more than growth in other sectors. While some reduced form analyses have tackled this question using either country-level time series data, regional panel data for one country, or cross-sectional country data, this paper is unusual in using panel data for many countries. We improve on much of the existing literature by devising an instrumental variables strategy to correct for the endogeneity of sectoral GDP growth, involving averaging over sectoral income growth rates for neighboring countries. Our principal finding from our instrumental variable estimator is that the estimated elasticities associated with growth in agricultural income are significantly greater than for non-agricultural income for all but the extreme top and bottom deciles. In the middle range of the income distribution the effect of a given GDP growth due to agriculture is 3-4 times larger than if it was due to non-agricultural activities. Having established that on average growth in GDP originating in agriculture is more beneficial for poorer deciles, we finally explore whether this is a pattern which holds across different groupings of countries. A second important finding is that there is heterogeneity across some groupings. Most particularly, we find that it is the poorest people in the poorest countries for whom agricultural income growth is the most beneficial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that lower risk employers subject to laws limiting allowable premium rating variation have a predicted probability of self-insurance that is about 18 percentage points higher than otherwise-similar higher risk employers, suggesting that these selection concerns are warranted.","[Trish, Erin] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Price Sch Publ Policy, Verna & Peter Dauterive Hall 412G,635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Herring, Bradley] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Hlth Econ, 624 North Broadway,Room 408, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",University of Southern California; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Trish, E (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Price Sch Publ Policy, Verna & Peter Dauterive Hall 412G,635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",etrish@healthpolicy.usc.edu; herring@jhu.edu,,"Herring, Bradley/0000-0001-6845-1412",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Policy Relevant Insurance Studies (PRIS) initiative [72672],Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Policy Relevant Insurance Studies (PRIS) initiative,"This research was supported by Grant No. 72672 from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Policy Relevant Insurance Studies (PRIS) initiative.

However, little is known about how CTs achieve this impact. We conducted a mixed-method review of studies in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fourteen quantitative and eight qualitative studies met our inclusion criteria, of which eleven and five, respectively, demonstrated evidence that CTs decrease IPV. We found little support for increases in IPV, with only two studies showing overall mixed or adverse impacts. Drawing on these studies, as well as related bodies of evidence, we developed a program theory proposing three pathways through which CT could impact IPV: (a) economic security and emotional well-being, (b) intra-household conflict, and (c) women's empowerment. The economic security and well-being pathway hypothesizes decreases in IPV, while the other two pathways have ambiguous effects depending on program design features and behavioral responses to program components. Future studies should improve IPV measurement, empirical analysis of program mechanisms, and fill regional gaps. Program framing and complementary activities, including those with the ability to shift intra-household power relations are likely to be important design features for understanding how to maximize and leverage the impact of CTs for reducing IPV, and mitigating potential adverse impacts.

Supporters of more disclosure argue that increased transparency will improve tax compliance, while opponents argue that it will divulge sensitive information that is, in many cases, misunderstood. Our results show that in Australia large private companies experienced some consumer backlash and, perhaps partly in anticipation, some acted to avoid disclosure. We detect a small increase (decrease) in tax payments for private (public) firms subject to disclosure suggesting differential costs of disclosure across firms. Finally, we find that investors react negatively to anticipated and actual disclosure of tax information, most likely due to anticipated policy backlash rather than consumer backlash or the revelation of negative information about cash flows. These findings are important for both managers and policy makers, as the trend towards increased tax disclosure continues to rise globally.","[Hoopes, Jeffrey L.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Robinson, Leslie] Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Dartmouth College; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Robinson, L (通讯作者)，Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",hoopes@unc.edu; leslie.robinson@dartmouth.edu; jslemrod@umich.edu,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020",,Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan; Tuck School of Business,Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan; Tuck School of Business,"We thank the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan and the Tuck School of Business for financial support to administer our survey through TurkPrime and to purchase YouGov data for our analyses of consumer sentiment in Australia.

We take a critical look at current efforts to measure women's empowerment at the individual/ household level through standardized tools. We examine the results of a household survey conducted in Nepal using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which was developed as a monitoring and evaluation tool for the Feed the Future Initiative. Our interpretation of the results is informed by qualitative fieldwork conducted in the same region. In our quantitative analysis, we regress correlates of empowerment identified in the literature, such as age, education, household wealth, income, and household composition, on individual empowerment as measured by the WEAI. While several factors associated with women's empowerment are significantly associated, household composition and intra-household relationships, which we expected to be essential factors in the local context, appear to be unrelated to the WEAI empowerment score. A measure of critical consciousness tested alongside the WEAI instrument appears instead to be closely associated with these factors. Our qualitative findings reveal that there is a discrepancy between local meanings of empowerment and definitions of empowerment defined in terms of agency. Based on these results, we suggest that improvements in measurement may be possible if approaches that measure power predominantly in terms of agency or decision-making were to include critical consciousness in their framework.

We found that: (1) 24 months post-intervention initiation, children in Bridges and Bridges PLUS were more likely to have accumulated savings than children in the control condition; (2) higher match incentives (Bridges PLUS) led to higher deposit frequency but not higher savings in the bank; (3) intervention participation did not result in material hardship; and (4) in both intervention arms, participating families were more likely to start a family business and diversify their assets.","[Wang, Julia Shu-Huah] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Work & Social Adm, Room 519,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ssewamala, Fred M.] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, Campus Box 1196,One Brookings Dr,Off 235, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Neilands, Torsten B.] UCSF Sch Med, Dept Med, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bermudez, Laura Gauer] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Garfinkel, Irwin] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, Contemporary Urban Problems, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Waldfogel, Jane] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, Social Work & Publ Affairs, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brooks-Gunn, Jeannie] Columbia Univ, Child Dev & Educ, Teachers Coll, 525 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brooks-Gunn, Jeannie] Columbia Univ, Pediat, Coll Phys & Surg, 525 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [You, Jing] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Washington University (WUSTL); University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University; Columbia University; Renmin University of China,"Wang, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Work & Social Adm, Room 519,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jshwang@hku.hk; FMS1@WUSTL.EDU; torsten.neilands@ucsf.edu; lgb2123@columbia.edu; ig3@columbia.edu; jw205@columbia.edu; brooks-gunn@columbia.edu; jing.you@ruc.edu.cn,"Wang, Julia Shu-Huah/ABB-7928-2021","Wang, Julia Shu-Huah/0000-0002-6128-8242; You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724; Ssewamala, Fred/0000-0002-4849-5650",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [1R01HD070727-01],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),The Bridges to the Future study was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) under Award Number 1R01HD070727-01.

While many of these episodes are in countries where official finance is important, we also identify episodes where a substantial fraction of domestic investment is financed by private capital inflows. Although there is evidence of a positive growth effect of such inflows in the short run, that positive impact dissipates after 5 years and turns negative over longer horizons. Many such episodes end abruptly, with compression of the current account and sharp slowdowns in investment and growth. Summing over the inflow (current account deficit) episode and its aftermath, we find that growth is slower than when countries rely on domestic savings. The implication is that financing growth and investment out of foreign savings, while not impossible, is risky and too often counterproductive.","[Cavallo, Eduardo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Panizza, Ugo] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Panizza, Ugo] CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",Inter-American Development Bank; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Panizza, U (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.;Panizza, U (通讯作者)，CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland.",cavalloe@iadb.org; eichengr@berkeley.edu; ugo.panizza@graduateinstitute.ch,"Panizza, Ugo/AAU-2064-2021",,,,,,42,10,13,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In particular, we find lower ex-ante welfare gains from eliminating Medicare when we account for the costs of transition.

We show how this space expands and contracts over time through cumulative causation. Such a dynamic framework allows us to appreciate the role of secondary towns in rural-urban migration and poverty reduction. Secondary towns occupy a unique middle ground between semi-subsistence agriculture and the capitalistic city; between what is close-by and familiar and what is much further away and unknown. By opening up the horizons of the (poorer) rural population and facilitating navigation of the non-farm economy, secondary towns allow a broader base of the poor population to become physically, economically and socially mobile. Secondary towns therefore have great potential as vehicles for inclusive growth and poverty reduction in urbanizing developing countries. These are the insights emerging from in-depth life history accounts of 75 purposively selected rural-urban migrants from rural Kagera, in Tanzania.

The study consists of a cluster-randomized, longitudinal design. After the baseline survey, half of these village clusters were randomly selected to receive the transfer and a follow-up was conducted 17 months later. We find that the short-term impact of household income increases from the cash transfer leads to substantial SWB gains among caregivers. After a year's worth of transfers, caregivers in beneficiary households have higher life satisfaction and are more likely to believe in a better future. We examine whether program impacts on consumption, food security, resilience, and hopefulness could explain the increase in SWB but do not find that any of these mechanisms individually mediate our results.","[Kilburn, Kelly] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Global Hlth & Infect Dis, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Abernethy Hall,Campus Box 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Tsoka, Maxton] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, Res, Zomba, Malawi; [Mvula, Peter] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, Zomba, Malawi",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of Malawi; University of Malawi,"Kilburn, K (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Global Hlth & Infect Dis, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",kkilburn@unc.edu; shanda@email.unc.edu; Gustavo_angeles@unc.edu; tsokamax@gmail.com; petermvula58@yahoo.com,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD050924] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,59,17,17,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

C.",,,THE SENSITIVITY OF CO2 EMISSIONS UNDER A CARBON TAX TO ALTERNATIVE BASELINE FORECASTS,CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon tax; CGE modeling; emissions sensitivity; climate,,"Future carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under a carbon tax depend on the time-path of the economy under baseline (business-as-usual) conditions as well as the extent to which the policy reduces emissions relative to the baseline. Considerable uncertainties surround the baseline forecasts for fuel prices, energy efficiency (energy-GDP ratios), and GDP, as evidenced by the significant ranges in the forecasts by government agencies and research institutions in the U.S. This paper assesses the significance of these uncertainties to the path of CO2 emissions under a carbon tax. We do this by examining the emissions levels and quantities of abatement that result from the E3 general equilibrium model under a range of alternative baseline forecasts for fuel prices, energy efficiency, and GDP, where the different baselines are produced through suitable changes to key model parameters. In addition, we consider how the time-profile of the carbon tax needed to achieve specified CO2 abatement targets is affected by such forecast-linked changes in parameters. We find that the sensitivity of baseline emissions to alternative forecasts depends on the particular forecasted variable under consideration. Baseline CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to alternative scenarios related to the rate of energy efficiency improvements in the nonenergy sector and the rate of general economic growth. In contrast, such emissions are much less sensitive to alternative scenarios related to the productivity of fossil fuel production. The extent of abatement from the baseline is generally fairly insensitive to changes in the scenarios for time-paths of fuel prices, energy-efficiency and GDP. We also find that short-term emissions targets can be achieved with relatively moderate carbon taxes under all of the baseline scenarios considered.","[Chen, Yunguang; Goulder, Lawrence H.; Hafstead, Marc A.

In line with the notion that signals are more valuable to receivers in environments of elevated information asymmetries and under the premise that long-distance transactions present such an environment, we empirically reveal that patent activity and founding team entrepreneurial experience are more effective in increasing venture capital investments when the distance between investors and investees is elevated. Our results, therefore, corroborate the rationale that because tacit knowledge circulates mostly within local circles, it diminishes the value of signals for local transactions, as a priori knowledge about potential target firms is more easily assessed by investors. Our study contributes to the literature on the factors that drive the value of signals, on the literature that studies the function of patents and other forms of intellectual property as a means to boost firm performance, and on the literature on the geography of venture capital investments.","[Kolympiris, Christos] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Hoenen, Sebastian] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Bath; Wageningen University & Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kolympiris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",c.kolympiris@bath.ac.uk; Sebastian.hoenen@wur.nl; kalaitzandonakesn@missouri.edu,,"Kolympiris, Christos/0000-0003-1933-6332",Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant [20050176],Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant,Research funding provided by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant #20050176 is gratefully acknowledged.

This demand has triggered changes throughout the food industry, and led to greater opportunities for product differentiation and the potential to add value to raw commodities. Greater differentiation and value adding over time has in turn dramatically changed the price spread or marketing bill between the farm value of products and the retail value. Thus a significantly greater percentage of the final price paid by consumers is now garnered down chain rather than up chain over the last 20 years. This apparent shifting of value creation or addition, as measured by the marketing margin, has invigorated empirical questions as to where, and how much value, is created along the agri-food value chain. First we define value creation/adding, and then we estimate the economic value added for 454 firms. We validate our findings by creating and employing three additional value creation measures - the modified economic value added, the creation or destruction of value, and the persistence of value creation. Finally we estimate value creation at each node of the value chain, measure the relative differences among firms and nodes, and estimate a model measuring the drivers of value adding.","[Cucagna, Maria Emilia; Goldsmith, Peter D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Goldsmith, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pgoldsmi@illinois.edu,,,,,,,89,30,31,3,80,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Welfare is measured by various dimensions of poverty and food insecurity; and agricultural productivity is measured by maize yield and value of crop output per hectare. The poverty measures included per capita consumption expenditure, relative deprivation in terms of per capita consumption expenditure, poverty gap and severity of poverty; and the measures of food insecurity included caloric intake and relative deprivation in terms of caloric intake. Depending on the measure of welfare, the impact of agricultural productivity was estimated with a household fixed effects estimator, a two-part estimator or a correlated-random effect ordered probit estimator. The results indicate that growth in agricultural productivity has the expected welfare-improving effect. In terms of economic magnitude, however, both the direct effect and economy-wide spillover effect (in the non-farm sector) of a percentage increase in agricultural productivity on the poverty and food security measures are small. Efforts to effectively improve the welfare of rural agricultural households should therefore go beyond merely increasing agricultural (land) productivity.","[Darko, Francis Addeah] World Bank Grp, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, JI Jenderal Sudirman Kav 52-53, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia; [Palacios-Lopez, Amparo] World Bank Grp, Dev Data Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Kilic, Talip] World Bank Grp, Dev Data Grp, Rome, Italy; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",The World Bank; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Darko, FA (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, JI Jenderal Sudirman Kav 52-53, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia.",fdarko@worldbank.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project,"Funding for this research was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project.

No commodity boom lasts forever, however, and threats to the continuation of this growth are mounting. Indonesia now faces the challenge of locking in gains and setting a course to sustain future development in less favourable times. Post-2000 growth differs from earlier experience in that exports of agricultural products, especially palm oil, have played a leading role. In contrast to the country's earlier oil and gas export boom, the gains from agricultural export growth have accrued mainly to private actors, including corporations, smallholders, and the agricultural labour force, with a much smaller share passing through government budgets. The government can no longer simply mandate the use of funds for development purposes; many other actors and institutions are involved. It is reasonable to suppose that the benefits from such a decentralised export boom would be widely diffused, with relatively large effects on rural and farm households and lower-skilled workers. However, this boom has been accompanied by a sharp rise in inequality and virtually no real wage growth. Moreover, while spending rose robustly during the boom, it is not clear that poor, farm-based households have chosen (or been able) to use gains to smooth consumption or to invest for future generations. The capacity to lock in gains at micro and macro levels is subject to significant policy influence. In line with the maxim that ` the time to repair a roof is when the sun is shining', currently healthy global economic conditions present an opportune moment for Indonesian policymakers to take stock and to look ahead, with an eye to optimal development policy settings.","[Shrestha, Rashesh] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Coxhead, Ian] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Shrestha, R (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,"Coxhead, Ian/0000-0001-6958-038X",,,,,30,5,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

When the variable annuity contains a long-term guarantee, this lapse-and-reentry strategy allows the policyholder to potentially increase the value of the embedded guarantee. We show that for a return-of-premium death benefit guarantee this is frequently optimal, which has severe repercussions for pricing. We analyze various policy features that may help mitigate the incentive to lapse and compare them regarding the insurer's average expense payments and their posttax utility to the policyholder. We find that a ratchet-type guarantee and a state-dependent fee structure best mitigate the lapse-and-reentry problem, outperforming the typical surrender schedule. Further, when accounting for proper tax treatment, the policyholder prefers a variable annuity with either of these three policy features over a comparable stock investment.","[Moenig, Thorsten] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, 1801 Liacouras Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Zhu, Nan] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, Risk Management Dept, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Moenig, T (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, 1801 Liacouras Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",moenig@temple.edu; nanzhu@psu.edu,"Moenig, Thorsten/R-9821-2019","Zhu, Nan/0000-0003-2617-575X",University of St. Thomas; Illinois State University,University of St. Thomas; Illinois State University,"We are indebted to two anonymous referees whose suggestions have led to a much improved article.

Numerical simulations indicate that an emissions trading system covering the power and industry sectors in all countries that made unconditional pledges could reduce the associated mitigation costs by more than 72 percent.

To assess the conventional view that assets uniformly improve childhood development through wealth effects, we use three waves of panel data from Tanzania and test whether different types of assets have differential effects on children's educational outcomes. Our results indicate that household durables and housing quality have positive effects, but agricultural assets have adverse effects on children's highest grade completed and exam performances. We use a Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable (HTIV) panel data estimator to identify the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant endogenous variables. We find that the negative effect of agricultural assets is driven by large agricultural equipment and livestock ownership and the negative effect is more pronounced among rural children, poor children, and children from farming households, presumably due to the higher opportunity cost of schooling.

We exploit a quasi-natural experiment that holds constant the information event across firms but varies the availability of a major news outlet in local markets. We find that firms subject to the threat of slanted coverage suppress the release of negative information before the event and release it subsequently.

I propose a tournament model of money market funds (MMFs) to study this question. When funds care about relative performance, an increase in the risk premium leads funds with lower default costs to increase risk taking, while funds with higher default costs decrease risk taking. Without changes in the premium, lower risk-free rates reduce the risk taking of all funds.

This paper analyses household survey data and hydrological riverine flood and drought data for 52 countries to find out whether poor people are disproportionally exposed to floods and droughts, and how this exposure may change in a future climate. We find that poor people are often disproportionally exposed to droughts and floods, particularly in urban areas. This pattern does not change significantly under future climate scenarios, although the absolute number of people potentially exposed to floods or droughts can increase or decrease significantly, depending on the scenario and region. In particular, many countries in Africa show a disproportionally high exposure of poor people to floods and droughts. For these hotspots, implementing risk-sensitive land-use and development policies that protect poor people should be a priority.","[Winsemius, Hessel C.] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Winsemius, Hessel C.; Jongman, Brenden; Veldkamp, Ted I.

We test three hypotheses about predictors of CCT program participation in indigenous societies in Bolivia, focusing on attributes of the household (ethnicity), parents (modern human capital), and children (age, sex). We model whether children receive a transfer from Bolivia's CCT program (Bono Juancito Pinto), using data from 811 school-age children and nine ethnic groups. Children from the group least exposed to Westerners (Tsimane') are 18-22 percentage points less likely to participate in the program than children from other lowland ethnic groups.

To address the issue of non -randomness in enrollment into the scheme, we exploit the longitudinal aspect of a large nationally representative household survey data to implement difference-indifferences with matching. We find that RSBY beneficiary households are more likely to report and receive treatment for long-term morbidity in rural areas: however. the differences in reporting and treatment of long-term morbidity is not statistically significant in urban areas. We do not find strong evidence that the RSBY reduced per person OOP expenditure for RSBY beneficiary households in both rural and urban areas. Conditional on having received medical treatment, we find that RSBY beneficiary patient spend less on medicine in rural areas but no statistically significant impact in urban areas.

We estimate that precautionary capital needs for the entire financial sector reached $2 trillion during the crisis. We also investigate the long-standing observation that equity volatility asymmetrically responds to positive and negative news.

The model sheds light on leverage cycles. During periods absent disasters: equity premia decrease; credit spreads decrease; expected loss-given-default increases; and leverage ratios increase. Time-since-prior-disaster is the key model conditioning variable. In response to a disaster, risk premia increase while firms sharply reduce labor, capital and leverage, with response size increasing in time-since-prior-disasters. Firms with high bankruptcy costs are most responsive to the time-since-disaster variable. Disaster responses are more pronounced than in an otherwise equivalent economy featuring observed disaster risk. Empirical tests of novel corporate finance predictions are conducted. Consistent with the model, we find empirically that leverage and investment are increasing in time-since-prior-recessions, with the effect more pronounced for firms with low recovery ratios.","[Hennessy, Christopher A.] London Business Sch, London, England; [Hennessy, Christopher A.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Hennessy, Christopher A.] ECGI, London, England; [Radnaev, Boris] Cornerstone Res, London, England",University of London; London Business School; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of London; London Business School; Cornerstone Research,"Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.;Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.;Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，ECGI, London, England.",,,,European Research Council,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Franklin Allen (the editor) and an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

A security's expected return is decomposed into its carry, an ex-ante and model-free characteristic, and its expected price appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry's premium.

In this paper, we discuss four policy scenarios that explore two overarching issues: (1) the effects of a carbon tax under alternative assumptions about the use of the resulting revenue, and (2) the effects of a system of import charges on carbon-intensive goods (border carbon adjustments or BCAs). Consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax raises considerable revenue and reduces CO2 emissions significantly relative to baseline, no matter how the revenue is used. Gross annual revenue from the carbon tax with lump sum rebating and no BCA begins at $110 billion in 2020 and rises gradually to $170 billion in 2040. By 2040, annual CO2 emissions fall from 5.5 billion metric tons (BMT) under the baseline to 2.4 BMT, a decline of 3.1 BMT, or 57%. Cumulative emissions over 2020 to 2040 fall by 48 BMT. Also consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax has very small overall impacts on gross domestic product (GDP), wages, employment, and consumption. Different uses of the revenue from the carbon tax result in slightly different levels and compositions of GDP across consumption, investment and net exports. Overall, using carbon tax revenue to reduce the capital income tax rate results in better macroeconomic outcomes than using the revenue for lump sum transfers. Counter to their purported purpose of protecting U.S. trade strength, for a given revenue policy, BCAs tend to produce lower net exports than the carbon taxes alone. This is generally because the BCAs raise the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, thus lowering exports more than they lower imports. This is consistent with standard results in the international trade literature on the effects of import tariffs and export subsidies on real exchange rates, a result that is often overlooked in the discussion of domestic carbon policy. In a finding new to the literature, our results show that BCAs can have strikingly different effects depending on the use of the revenue. Under a lump sum rebate, BCAs exacerbate the impact of the carbon tax by lowering domestic output further than it would fall under the carbon tax alone. Under a capital tax swap, however, BCAs have a moderating effect: they reduce the impact of the tax on most industries.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.; Liu, Weifeng] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.; Morris, Adele C.; Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA",Australian National University; Brookings Institution; Syracuse University,"Morris, AC (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",amorris@brookings.edu,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021; Liu, Weifeng/0000-0001-9466-3558",Alex C.

The development of resource tenure interventions that promote sustainable management practices has been challenged by the difficulties of determining how contextual factors affect environmental outcomes given the complexity of socio-ecological systems. Realist synthesis is a promising evidence review technique for identifying the mechanisms that influence policy intervention outcomes in complex systems. Through a combination of inductive and deductive analysis of the links between context, mechanisms, and outcomes, realist synthesis can help clarify when, how, where, and why property regime interventions are likely to result in positive environmental outcomes. Our study revealed the importance of disaggregating property regimes into sub-categories, rather than treating them as homogenous categories, More importantly, use of a realist synthesis approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which three mechanisms perceptions of legitimacy, perceptions of the likelihood of benefits, and perceptions of enforcement capacity interact under different socio-ecological contexts to trigger behavioral changes that affect environmental conditions. The approach revealed the multi-faceted and interactive nature of perceptions of legitimacy, in which legal legitimacy, social acceptability, and ecological credibility combined to create robust legitimacy. The existence of robust legitimacy in turn appeared to be an important contributor to the success of regulatory systems reliant on voluntary compliance. Our study contributes to the field of natural resources governance by demonstrating the utility of a systematic review method which has received little attention by property scholars but which has promise to clarify understanding of how complex systems work. Our study also highlights that achieving long-term sustainability requires paying greater attention to the mechanisms that support or undermine people's willingness to voluntarily engage in conservation behaviors.

A new but actively growing literature is now emerging at their intersection. I review this literature and argue that shadow banking in China is not fundamentally different from the textbook definition of shadow banking, namely credit intermediation with maturity mismatch that is structured to avoid regulation. I emphasize maturity mismatch because that is what creates run risk and makes any shadow banking system inherently fragile. I explain how the rise of shadow banking in China can be traced back to stricter liquidity regulation, how shadow banking has changed the financial landscape in China, and what the current state of the industry is. Interactions between shadow banking and the rest of the economy have some characteristics that reflect China's unique politico-economic structure, but this is because the rest of the economy has these characteristics, not because there is something fundamentally different about the forces behind shadow banking in China.","[Hachem, Kinda] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA; [Hachem, Kinda] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hachem, K (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.;Hachem, K (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,61,23,23,6,90,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The initiative process is associated with lower spending and taxes in American states and Swiss cantons, but with higher spending in cities. The initiative is consistently associated with more conservative social policies.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14-16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders.

Our generalized q model informs us to use corporate credit-risk information to predict investments when empirical measurement issues of Tobin's average q are significant (e.g., equity is much more likely to be mis-priced than debt), as in Philippon (2009). We find, consistent with our theory, that credit spreads and bond q have significant predictive powers on micro-level and aggregate investments corroborating the recent empirical work of Gilchrist and Zakrajgek (2012).

The model highlights the source of debate over whether countries should use the global or domestic SCC for regulatory impact analysis. I identify conditions under which a country's decision to internalize the global SCC is individually rational. I show that obtaining international consensus on a uniform value to internalize will be more challenging than often appreciated. I introduce the notion of a preferred SCC to reflect each country's preference conditional on a true value of the global SCC and a distribution of the domestic SCCs among countries. While all countries have a preferred SCC greater than their domestic SCC, a country's preferred SCC can be greater than or less than the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement depends on institutional arrangements for collective decision making, for which I provide empirical evidence based on various decision rules.","[Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu,,,,,,,36,30,33,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Results suggest that the lifecycle of cleared derivatives shifted in the 2000's. Derivatives with low trading volumes moved to modest volumes with increased probability. Prior to that shift, less popular contracts were likely to remain at low volumes or be delisted altogether. This additional resilience from low levels of trading improved the trajectory of trading volumes for the marginal contract, despite the decade's launch of a record number of new contracts and historic abundance of rarely traded contracts. The New York Mercantile Exchange, an exchange that shifted abruptly to electronic trading, provides some evidence that this shift was driven by new technology. We present our analysis as a non-stationary Markov model, estimated using Bayesian methods. This approach offers simple summary statistics to inform the launch of a new derivatives contract, organized in a model that describes the dynamics of the derivatives market as a whole. This facilitates distributional comparisons among historical groups of contracts (e.g. across time, exchange, or product type) as well as simulation of new derivatives emerging over time.","[Cavanaugh, Grant] Nephila Climate, 801 Larkspur Landing Circle, Larkspur, CA 94939 USA; [Penick, Michael] US Commod Futures Trading Commiss, Off Chief Economist, 1155 21st St NW, Washington, DC 20581 USA",,"Cavanaugh, G (通讯作者)，Nephila Climate, 801 Larkspur Landing Circle, Larkspur, CA 94939 USA.",gcavanaugh@nephilaclimate.com; mpenick@cftc.gov,,,,,,,28,0,1,3,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

It also evaluates how three important aspects of the fiscal-exchange trust in government, perceptions of the public good, and level of income-shape the effect of these design features. Based on an original survey experiment focusing on the provision of public safety in Mexico, I find that these design features increase political support for taxation, especially among those with low trust in government and low income.

We demonstrate that while risk-and non-risk based capital ratios improve bank efficiency and profitability, risk-based capital ratios fail to decrease bank risk. Our results cast doubts on the validity of the weighting methodologies used for calculating risk-based capital ratios and on the efficacy of regulatory monitoring. The ineffectiveness of risk-based capital ratios with regard to bank risk is likely to be exacerbated by the adoption of the new Basel III capital guidelines. While Basel III requires banks to hold higher liquidity ratios along with higher capital ratios, our findings suggest that imposing higher capital ratios may have a negative effect on the efficiency and profitability of highly liquid banks. Our results hold across different subsamples, alternative risk, efficiency, and profitability measures and a battery of estimation techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since the mid-1990s, however, wage inequality has been falling. Since most trade models suggest that output prices can affect factor prices, this paper explores the relationship between output prices and wage inequality. A Salter-Swan trade model with firm heterogeneity driven by variations in the relative price of tradable relative to non-tradable goods can explain the decline in wage inequality. The paper compares this model's predictions with Mexican inequality statistics using data on output prices, census data, and quarterly household survey data. In spite of the model's simplicity, the model's predictions match Mexican variables reasonably well during the years when wage inequality fell.","[Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI USA; [Halliday, Timothy; Robertson, Raymond] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Robertson, Raymond] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; IZA Institute Labor Economics; The World Bank; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Robertson, R (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Robertson, R (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",robertson@tamu.edu,"Halliday, Timothy/F-5032-2010","Robertson, Raymond/0000-0002-0989-7673",Regional Studies Program of the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America; Caribbean of The World Bank Group,Regional Studies Program of the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America; Caribbean of The World Bank Group,"The authors thank seminar participants at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Tulane University, Texas A&M, and the Authors' Workshop for the World Bank's Latin American and Caribbean Regional Study on Wage Inequality Trends, especially William Cline, Caroline Freund, Joseph Francois, Arvind Subramanian, Rafael Dix-Carneiro, Joana Silva, Julian Messina, and Augusto de la Torre.

The countercyclicality of multilateral development bank (MDB) lending is mostly driven by the behavior of the World Bank (borrowing from regional development banks tends to be acyclical). The paper also shows that MDB lending to Latin America and East Asia is more countercyclical than MDB lending to other regions. Private sector lending is instead procyclical in all developing regions. While the cyclicality of MDB lending does not depend on domestic or international conditions, private lending becomes particularly procyclical in periods of limited global capital flows. By focusing on both borrower and lender heterogeneity, the paper shows that the cyclical properties of international government debt are mostly driven by credit supply shocks. Demand factors appear to be less important drivers of procyclical international government borrowing. The focus on supply and demand factors is different from the traditional push and pull classification, as push and pull factors could affect both the demand and the supply of international government debt.

Bank leverage of 85% or higher emerges because bank seniority both dramatically reduces bank asset volatility and incentivizes risk-taking by producing a skewed return distribution. Nonfinancial firms choose low leverage to protect their banks, presenting a partial resolution to the low-leverage puzzle. Our setup naturally extends to include government actions as we model bank assets using a modified Basel framework. Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can increase bank risk due to a compensating increase in borrower leverage.

Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010-2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.","[Narlochand, Ulf; Bangalore, Mook] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work is part of programmatic work on Climate Change, Poverty and Climate Resilience in Vietnam and was developed under the oversight of Christophe Crepin and Stephane Hallegatte.

We apply a local projection method to a new dataset of major country-and country-sector-level reform shocks in various areas of labor market institutions and product market regulation covering 26 advanced economies over the past four decades. Product market reforms are found to raise productivity and output, but gains materialize only slowly. The impact of labor market reforms is primarily on employment, but it varies across types of reforms and depends on overall business cycle conditions-unlike that of product market reforms. Reductions in labor tax wedges and increases in public spending on active labor market policies have larger effects during periods of slack, in part because they usually entail some degree of fiscal stimulus. In contrast, reforms to employment protection arrangements and unemployment benefit systems have positive effects in good times, but can become contractionary in periods of slack. The economy's response to such reforms is significantly improved when they are accompanied by fiscal or monetary stimulus.","[Duval, Romain; Furceri, Davide] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org,,,,,,,64,45,51,2,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

By emphasizing the use of two econometric approaches based on quantile regressions (standard quantile regression and Bayesian quantile regression with heteroskedasticity) we find that the propagation of shocks in euro's bond yield spreads shows almost no presence of shift-contagion in the sample periods considered (2003-2006, Nov. 2008-Nov. 2011, Dec. 2011-Apr. 2013). Shock transmission is no different on days with big spread changes and small changes. This is the case even though a significant number of the countries in our sample have been extremely affected by their sovereign debt and fiscal situations. The risk spillover among these countries is not affected by the size or sign of the shock, implying that so far contagion has remained subdued. However, the US crisis does generate a change in the intensity of the propagation of shocks in the eurozone between the 2003-2006 pre-crisis period and the Nov. 2008-Nov. 2011 post-Lehman one, but the coefficients actually go down, not up! All the increases in correlation we have witnessed over the last years come from larger shocks and the heteroskedasticity in the data, not from similar shocks propagated with higher intensity across Europe. These surprising, but robust, results emerge because this is the first paper, to our knowledge, in which a Bayesian quantile regression approach allowing for heteroskedasticity is used to measure contagion. This methodology is particularly well-suited to deal with nonlinear and unstable transmission mechanisms especially when asymmetric responses to sign and size are suspected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We survey the existing evidence, which suggests that inflated house-price expectations across the economy played a central role in driving both the demand for and the supply of mortgage credit before the crisis. The great misnomer of the 2008 crisis is that it was not a subprime crisis but rather a middle-class crisis. Inflated house-price expectations led households across all income groups, especially the middle class, to increase their demand for housing and mortgage leverage. Similarly, banks lent against increasing collateral values and underestimated the risk of defaults.

Controlling for credit score and other risk factors, AfricanAmerican and Hispanic borrowers are 103% and 78% more likely to receive high-cost mortgages for home purchases. Alarge part of the increase is attributable to sorting across lenders (55%-65%), and this, in turn, can be largely accounted for by the lender's ex post foreclosure risk. The remaining within-lender differences are also concentrated in high-risk lenders, revealing the central role of these institutions in explaining market-wide racial and ethnic differences.","[Bayer, Patrick] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Bayer, Patrick; Ferreira, Fernando] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ferreira, Fernando] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ross, Stephen L.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; University of Connecticut,"Ross, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 309 Oak Hall,365 Fairfield Way U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",stephen.l.ross@uconn.edu,,,Ford Foundation; Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,Ford Foundation; Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,"This work was supported by the Ford Foundation, the Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton, and the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut.",,44,53,62,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Household demographic data, including household food security status, were collected.

South Asia has the highest rates of open defecation worldwide, and although the incidence declines as household income rises, differences across South Asian countries are not explained by differences in per capita income. The rate of open defecation in sub-national regions of Bangladesh, India and Nepal is highly correlated with the fraction of the population that identifies as Hindu, in part because certain rituals of purity and pollution discourage having latrines in close proximity to one's home. Almost all open defecation occurs in rural areas, and this paper estimates how much the rate could be reduced if rural households in regions that have a higher fraction of Hindus, where open defecation is still common, altered their behaviour to reflect that of non-Hindu households in regions that are predominantly non-Hindu, where the rate of open defecation is much lower. Using nonparametric reweighting methods, this paper projects that rural open defecation in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal could be reduced to rates of between 6 and 8 per cent, compared to the prevailing level of 65 per cent.","[Vyas, Sangita; Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Vyas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sangita@riceinstitute.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"Partial support for the authors' work was provided by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318].

However, little is known about tomato juice consumers in the United States. The goal of this research was to determine consumer attitudes towards current tomato juice offerings and willingness to pay for high flavor quality products. A sensory panel and a nation-wide survey were conducted to learn about consumer preference toward tomato juice consumption. A new label, including taste review ratings, was incorporated into a choice experiment to verify whether this information successfully assisted consumers in their purchase decisions. Both the sensory analysis and the consumer online survey showed a demand for tomato juice with better flavor. The results suggest that a premium quality tomato juice with fresh aroma notes and better taste made from a premium tomato will encourage consumer purchase intent. Consumers would be willing to pay up to 30% more if trusted taste review score information was provided.","[Zhu, Yaozhou] Mission Foods, 5601 Execut Dr, Irving, TX 75038 USA; [Shen, Meng] Boston Strateg Partners, 4 Wellington St,Suite 43, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sims, Charles A.; Marshall, Maurice R.; Sarnoski, Paul J.] Univ Florida, Food Sci & Human Nutr Dept, POB 110370, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Sarnoski, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food Sci & Human Nutr Dept, POB 110370, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",psarnoski@ufl.edu,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017",,University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences,University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences,The authors thank the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences for funding support for this project.,,23,10,12,6,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We employ difference-in-differences research design to show that infants born in districts severely affected by the earthquake are 13.8% less likely to complete middle school and 10% less likely to complete high school. Our findings demonstrate that children belonging to high caste groups mitigate the negative environmental shock in the long run. However, infants belonging to low caste groups are 17.6% less likely to complete middle school and 11.9% less likely to complete high school. We also find that male infants exposed to a severe earthquake perform significantly better than their female counterparts, suggesting prospects of gender bias in a patriarchal society.

We rationalize these phenomena by extending a traditional default framework to incorporate bankers who lend to both government and firms. When bankers are exposed to government debt, a default generates a banking crisis, which triggers collapses in corporate credit and output.

Yet smallholder farmers and pastoralists are affected by multiple processes of land alienation. Drawing on the case of Tanzania, we illustrate the analytical purchase of a comprehensive examination of dynamics of land alienation across multiple sectors. To begin with, processes of land alienation through investments in agriculture, mining, conservation, and tourism dovetail with a growing social differentiation and class formation. These dynamics generate unequal patterns of land deprivation and accumulation that evolve in a context of continued land dependency for the vast majority of the rural population. Consequently, land alienation engenders responses by individuals and communities seeking to maintain control over their means of production. These responses include migration, land tenure formalization, and land transactions, that propagate across multiple localities and scales, interlocking with and further reinforcing the effects of land alienation. Various localized processes of primitive accumulation contribute to a scramble for land in the aggregate, providing justifications for policies that further drive land alienation.","[Bluwstein, Jevgeniy; Lund, Jens Friis] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 25 Rolighedsvej, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Lund, Jens Friis] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Askew, Kelly] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, 1085 Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Askew, Kelly; Stein, Howard] Univ Michigan, Dept Afroamer & African Studies, 505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Noe, Christine] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Geog, POB 35049, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Odgaard, Rie; Maganga, Faustin] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, POB 35097, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Engstrom, Linda] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Odgaard, Rie] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Bluwstein, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 25 Rolighedsvej, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jevgeniy@ifro.ku.dk,"Bluwstein, Jevgeniy/AAB-4954-2020; Maganga, Faustin/W-3436-2019; Lund, Jens/D-8776-2015","Bluwstein, Jevgeniy/0000-0002-1162-5028; , Christine Noe/0000-0002-3031-8074; Lund, Jens/0000-0002-7336-0395","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE/L00139X/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Torben & Alice Frimodts Foundation; Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark [15-P02-TAN]; Danish Council for Independent Research (FSE) [6119-00012]; National Science Foundation in the USA [0921757]; Royal Danish Embassy in Dar es Salaam [104.Tanzania.809-300-1]; Swedish Research Council [229-2011-1417]; SIDA [SWE-2011-140]; NERC [NE/L00139X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Torben & Alice Frimodts Foundation; Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark; Danish Council for Independent Research (FSE); National Science Foundation in the USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Royal Danish Embassy in Dar es Salaam; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); SIDA; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank two anonymous reviewers for comments and feedback.

In contrast to the evidence in developed markets, positive feedback traders migrate from spot to futures markets in four markets, which suggests that the introduction of index futures may destabilize some emerging stock markets. Another interesting finding is that positive feedback trading becomes more intense when there is a market decline in the majority of the markets.","[Kutan, Ali M.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Shi, Yukun; Wei, Mingzhe] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; University of Glasgow; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yukun.shi@glasgow.ac.uk; zhaoyang8@jxufe.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; wei, mingzhe/0000-0002-8817-7788",Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province [JD16063],Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province,We wish to thank the two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Specifically, it investigates if transfers: 1) induce higher spending on alcohol or tobacco; 2) are fully consumed (rather than invested); 3) create dependency (reduce participation in productive activities); 4) increase fertility; 5) lead to negative community-level economic impacts (including price distortion and inflation); and 6) are fiscally unsustainable. The paper presents evidence refuting each claim, leading to the conclusion that these perceptions-insofar as they are utilized in policy debates-undercut potential improvements in well-being and livelihood strengthening among the poor, which these programs can bring about in sub-Saharan Africa, and globally. It concludes by underscoring outstanding research gaps and policy implications for the continued expansion of unconditional cash transfers in the region and beyond.","[Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Daidone, Silvio] UN Food & Agr Org FAO, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Peterman, Amber; Palermo, Tia] United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF, Off Res Innocenti, Florence, Italy; [Davis, Benjamin] UN Food & Agr Org FAO, Strateg Programme Reducing Rural Poverty, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Pereira, Audrey] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Yablonski, Jennifer] United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF, Ghana Country Off, Accra, Ghana",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Handa, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",shanda@email.unc.edu; Silvio.Daidone@fao.org; apeterman@unicef.org; Benjamin.Davis@fao.org; audrey.pereira@cgiar.org; tmpalermo@unicef.org; jyablonski@unicef.org,"Daidone, Silvio/AAJ-4490-2021; Palermo, Tia/ABI-8328-2020; Daidone, Silvio/ABC-5526-2021","Daidone, Silvio/0000-0002-1789-5635; Peterman, Amber/0000-0002-3921-5936; Pereira, Audrey/0000-0001-7982-7454","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Ghana); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Malawi); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Zimbabwe); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ghana); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Lesotho); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ethiopia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Malawi); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Kenya); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zambia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zimbabwe); EU, European Union (Lesotho); EU, European Union (Malawi); EU, European Union (Zimbabwe); Irish Aid (Malawi); Irish Aid (Zambia); KfW Development Bank (Malawi); NIH, The United States National Institute of Health (Kenya); Sida (Zimbabwe); SDC, Swiss Development Cooperation (Zimbabwe); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Ghana); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Zambia); UNICEF Mozambique","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Ghana); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Malawi); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Zimbabwe); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ghana); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Lesotho); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ethiopia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Malawi); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Kenya); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zambia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zimbabwe); EU, European Union (Lesotho); EU, European Union (Malawi); EU, European Union (Zimbabwe); Irish Aid (Malawi); Irish Aid (Zambia); KfW Development Bank (Malawi); NIH, The United States National Institute of Health (Kenya); Sida (Zimbabwe); SDC, Swiss Development Cooperation (Zimbabwe); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Ghana)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Malawi)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.S. Department of Labor (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Zambia); UNICEF Mozambique","This work was supported by a large number of donors across evaluations and institutions.

Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of migration as adaptation than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013-15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of migration as adaptation and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.

We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality.

Using a sample of 1310 married individuals, we found evidence of partial mediation in that materialism was negatively associated with perception of marriage importance, and this association partially explained why being materialistic was associated with lower marital satisfaction. Thus, as counselors, therapists, and financial planners work with married clients, it is important that they consider how their clients' materialistic tendencies may influence the family both financially and relationally.

Applying instrumental variables methods to data on approximately 90 U.S. bank holding companies over the 1999-2015 period, we argue that these inconclusive results are due to the fact that there is a non-linear, U-shaped relationship between gender diversity on boards and various measures of bank performance: female participation has a positive effect once a threshold level of gender diversity is achieved. Furthermore, this positive effect is only observed in better capitalized banks. Our results suggest that continuing the voluntary expansion of gender diversity on bank boards will be value enhancing, provided that they are well capitalized.

It has been suggested that when evaluating the impact of an intervention, the affected population should be allowed to define well-being (requiring a subjective measure), and impacts (requiring a participatory approach), but very few, if any, conservation evaluations live up to these standards. We used a participatory impact evaluation approach with the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) to investigate the relative impacts of strict protection and community forest management on local well-being in Madagascar's rainforests. The GPGI captures the subjective and multidimensional nature of well-being by asking respondents to identify the five most important domains for their quality of life, to evaluate their own performance in each domain, and the relative importance of the five identified domains. Participatory impact evaluation establishes local perceptions of the cause-effect relationship between an intervention and respondents' performance in each domain. Over half the respondents perceived no positive or negative impacts from the conservation interventions. We found no significant difference between strict protection and community forest management in the measures we used to examine the magnitude of their relative impacts, but there were differences in the characteristics of domains impacted and in the priority domains that could be targeted to improve well-being in locally meaningful ways. Because of its subjectivity, the GPGI cannot provide quantitative information on the magnitude of impacts. Its strength lies in the wealth of information it provides on what life domains people value and their performance in these domains. Combined with the participatory impact evaluation approach, the GPGI provides highly relevant insights that can be used to improve interventions in ways which increase the local legitimacy and acceptability of conservation initiatives.

Building on the functions of fiat money as both medium of exchange, and store of value like corporate equity, our model connects monetary economics, fiscal theory, and international finance under a unified corporate finance perspective. With frictionless capital markets both a Modigliani-Miller theorem for nations and the classical quantity theory of money hold. With capital market frictions, a nation's optimal capital structure trades off inflation dilution costs and expected default costs on foreign-currency debt. Our framing focuses on the process by which new money claims enter the economy and the potential wealth redistribution costs of inflation.","[Bolton, Patrick] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bolton, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bolton, Patrick] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Huang, Haizhou] China Int Capital Corp, Washington, DC USA; [Huang, Haizhou] CF40, Washington, DC USA; [Huang, Haizhou] SAIF, Washington, DC USA; [Huang, Haizhou] PBCSF, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Bolton, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Bolton, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bolton, P (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,48,10,13,2,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This article investigates asking-price formation across the Indonesian archipelago, including previously unstudied regional property markets. We compile a rich micro dataset of asking prices for residential, commercial, and undeveloped land from a nationwide classifieds database. Through a hedonic price analysis we identify the impact of property and advertisement attributes on asking prices for each type of property, using spatial fixed effects to control for spatially correlated unobservable characteristics at the district and city levels. Results indicate that property characteristics, land ownership status, and advertising method are all statistically significant indicators of asking price. We find considerable heterogeneity in asking-price formation in residential, commercial, and undeveloped land, and identify key differences between urban and rural markets.","[Gnagey, Matthew] Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Tans, Ryan] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University; Emory University,"Gnagey, M (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",,"Tans, Ryan/AGQ-3844-2022","Tans, Ryan/0000-0001-7949-5103; Gnagey, Matthew/0000-0001-9258-5680",,,,,53,4,5,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Low-duration firms generate short-run cash flows and face strong reinvestment risk. High-duration firms have long-run cash flows and their present value increases when discount rates decrease as a result of a deteriorating investment environment. Our empirical analysis reveals a significant return premium of low-duration stocks, confirming that investors charge a risk premium for stocks with returns that are positively related to the investment environment. Our newly introduced risk factor carries significant risk premiums in cross-sectional asset pricing tests. These premiums are robust to including further risk factors and a variety of different test specifications. Notably, our duration risk factor retains high explanatory power on the cross-section of stock returns in a model including direct measurement of the investment environment via state variable innovations.

Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Eckbo, B.

This article establishes the technique and illustrates its application to many questions, old and new. For example, among many other older and other technically more difficult results, it is shown that (1) several implications of globally greater risk aversion depend on distinct mathematical properties when the initial wealth level is known, (2) whether opening up a new asset market increases or decreases saving depends on whether the reciprocal of marginal utility is concave or convex, and (3) whether opening up a new asset market raises or lowers risk aversion toward small independent risks depends on whether absolute risk aversion is convex or concave.","[Gollier, Christian] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Kimball, Miles S.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Gollier, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",christian.gollier@tse-fr.eu,,,chair SCOR; FDIR at TSE,chair SCOR; FDIR at TSE,Miles S.

This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and profiles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers' perceived purchase risk or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially anonymous market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We find that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8%-10% lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renter-available information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not find any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our findings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.

ECB bond buying had a large impact on the price of short and medium maturity bonds, resulting in a remarkable twist of the Greek yield curve. However, the effects were limited to those sovereign bonds actually bought. We find little evidence for positive effects on market quality, or spill-overs to close substitute bonds, CDS markets, or corporate bonds.

We develop an intrahousehold decision-making model to illustrate how technology adoption can influence bargaining processes on farms in harsh agricultural environments of West Africa, where staple food production by extended families is organized collectively under the leadership of a senior head. The head, who assumes primary responsibility for household food security, also allocates fields to members who manage production individually. Drawing on this and the intrinsic complementarity of labor and fertilizer as divisible inputs, we test the nature of the linkage between fertilizer use on collective and individual plots by applying bivariate probit and tobit models to nationally-representative, panel data from Burkina Faso. We find evidence of input sharing, though bargaining is inadequate to sustain efficient allocation of fertilizer. Plot manager characteristics that influence bargaining power, such as literacy, gender, age, contact with extension, and membership in farmer organizations differ between collectively- and individually-managed plots-confirming the differential status of household members in technology adoption. Agroforestry practices are strongly and positively associated with fertilizer use, regardless of plot manage type. Programs aimed at increasing use of modern agricultural inputs should consider impacts on bargaining positions within the household. Providing inputs to women and young men will increase their influence on other decisions, which may lead to greater equity within the household. It may also enhance efficiency in production, since currently, inputs are not allocated efficiently within the household. (C) 2017 The Authors.

However, little consensus exists on the extent to which environmental regulation might generate profitability enhancing innovation offsets. This paper reports on a meta-analysis of 103 publications that estimate the relationship between environmental regulation and firm- or country-level productivity or competitiveness. We find considerable heterogeneity in both the sign and significance level of over 2,000 estimated effect sizes in these studies. A positive effect of environmental regulation is more likely at the state, region, or country level, compared to facility, firm, or industry levelalthough in both cases the most likely scenario is statistical insignificance. These findings are consistent with the strong version of the Porter hypothesis whereby strict but flexible environmental regulations induce innovation and over time increase country-level competitiveness.","[Cohen, Mark A.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cohen, Mark A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tubb, Adeline] UCL, London, England",Vanderbilt University; Resources for the Future; University of London; University College London,"Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Mark.Cohen@owen.vanderbilt.edu,"Cohen, Mark A/H-6449-2011","Cohen, Mark A/0000-0002-1548-2773",Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,"Mark A.

We find that during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, firm-specific volatility increased moderately but never substantially exceeded its sample mean.

We implement various tax trajectories and options for using the revenue collected by the tax and describe their impact on household welfare and its distribution across income levels. Overall, we find that our top-down/bottom-up models affects estimates of the distribution and cost of emission reductions as well as the amount of revenue collected, but that these are mostly insensitive to the way the revenue is recycled. We find that substantial abatement opportunities through fuel switching and renewable penetration in the electricity sector allow the economy to accommodate extensive emissions reductions at relatively low cost. While welfare impacts are largely determined by the choice of revenue recycling scheme, all tax levels and schemes provide net benefits when accounting for the avoided global climate change benefits of emission reductions. Recycling revenue through capital income tax rebates is more efficient than labor income tax rebates or uniform transfers to households. While capital tax rebates substantially reduce the overall costs of emission abatement, they profit high income households the most and are regressive. We more generally identify a clear trade-off between equity and efficiency across the various recycling options. However, we show through a set of hybrid recycling schemes that it is possible to limit inequalities in impacts, particularly those on the lowest income households, at relatively little incremental cost.","[Caron, Justin; Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cohen, Stuart M.; Brown, Maxwell] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Caron, Justin] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Caron, J (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",justin.caron@hec.ca,,,,,,,21,17,19,3,35,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Our analysis exploits China's 2008 mandate requiring firms to disclose CSR activities, using a difference-in-differences design. Although the mandate does not require firms to spend on CSR, we find that mandatory CSR reporting firms experience a decrease in profitability subsequent to the mandate. In addition, the cities most impacted by the disclosure mandate experience a decrease in their industrial wastewater and SO2 emission levels. These findings suggest that mandatory CSR disclosure alters firm behavior and generates positive externalities at the expense of shareholders. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We use three measures of forest user group collective action, including membership in the Nepal Community Forestry Programme (CFP). Collective action shows large, positive, and statistically significant carbon effects vis-avis communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action, which do not necessarily correspond with results for other measures of forest quality. We find that depending on the collective action definition and physiographic region, forests controlled by communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action may have as little as 34% of the carbon of forests governed under collective action. We do not, however, find evidence that CFP forests, our narrowest measure of collective action, store more carbon than forests outside the CFP. Our results therefore suggest that it is the collective action behavior and not the official CFP label that offers the largest gains. Carbon benefits from collective action are therefore not found to be conditional on CFP participation. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We use a variety of state-level data sources, together with a general equilibrium spatial model of the United States to systematically construct a panel dataset of state-level land use restrictions between 1950 and 2014. We show that these restrictions have generally tightened over time, particularly in California and New York. We use the model to analyze how these restrictions affect economic activity and the allocation of workers and capital across states. Counterfactual experiments show that deregulating existing urban land from 2014 regulation levels back to 1980 levels would have increased US GDP and productivity roughly to their current trend levels. California, New York, and the Mid-Atlantic region expand the most in these counterfactuals, drawing population out of the South and the Rustbelt. General equilibrium effects, particularly the reallocation of capital across states, account for much of these gains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Special attention is given in to investigate the impact of the marketing channel used by the farmers on their technical performance. The data used in this study were obtained from a farm-level survey of 139 small-scale raspberry farmers. A stochastic production frontier model was used to evaluate the association between TE, extension, training and farmers' decisions to sell their production directly to the agro-industry or indirectly through an informal middleman. The empirical results show that the decision to sell raspberries using informal channels is negatively associated with farm productivity and revenues. The analysis also reveals a positive relationship between TE and income among experienced and trained farmers. Implementing food quality and safety standards was also found decisive in increasing farm income. Policy implications stemming from these results are also discussed.","[Jara-Rojas, Roberto; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.; Martinez Arriagada, Daniela] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, POB 747, Talca 3460000, Chile; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Solis, Daniel] Florida A&M Univ, Agribusiness Program, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA",Universidad de Talca; University of Connecticut; State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University,"Jara-Rojas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, POB 747, Talca 3460000, Chile.",rjara@utalca.cl,"Jara-Rojas, Roberto/AAY-3810-2021; Solis, Daniel/B-1031-2009","Jara-Rojas, Roberto/0000-0001-5693-0037",,,,,43,10,10,2,11,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We find that large, diversified publicly traded firms increase their scope during times of high external capital market frictions, such as in the recent Great Recession. Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in external market conditions. Our evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that firms diversify their scope in response to tightening in external capital markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite the common assumption used in the empirical literature of homogenous impact across banks, the strength of this relationship is often bank-specific, and imposing homogeneity may lead to over- or underestimating the resilience of the financial system to macroeconomic woes. We introduce a three-stage approach to generate forecasts of macro-financial variables and project non-performing loans (NPLs) in a way that accounts for banks' heterogeneous reactions to macro-financial shocks in a dynamic context and for potential cross-sectional dependence across banks caused by common shocks. An application to Ecuador suggests that both substantial heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence are present and that should be taken into account when trying to anticipate inflections in the quality of the portfolio.

This study presents evidence that time-varying volatility can account for the power law property of high frequency stock returns. In particular, one finds that a conditional normal model with nonparametric volatility provides a strong fit. Specifically, a cross-sectional regression of the power law coefficients obtained from stock returns on the coefficients implied by the nonparametric volatility model yields a slope close to one. Further, for most of the stocks in the sample taken individually, the model-implied coefficient falls within the 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient estimated from returns data.","[Warusawitharana, Missaka] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Supervis & Regulat, Mail Stop 1814,20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Warusawitharana, M (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Supervis & Regulat, Mail Stop 1814,20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",missaka.n.warusawitharana@frb.gov,,,,,,,34,14,14,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Markets provide a suboptimal amount of investment in sectors characterized by learning spillovers. We show that a stable and competitive RER policy may correct for this externality and other related market failures. The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows. We also discuss the trade-offs associated with alternative stable and competitive RER policies and the relationship between the use of exchange rate policies for macro-stability and for development.

Jumps communicate bidders' information rapidly, leading to contests that are completed in a few bids.

Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010-2012 and 2013-2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents' efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and business-as-usual interests.

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to determine which trajectories changed where, and to what scale of human consequence. We perform three empirical assessments: a count of countries that accelerated their rate of progress post-2000; statistical t-tests for differences in mean country rates of progress; and a determination of the incremental lives saved or improved (or not) due to accelerated progress above pre-MDG trends. We find that low-income countries and sub-Saharan African countries had positive acceleration on a majority of indicators and accounted for much of the world's post-2000 accelerations. Middle-income countries typically registered larger cumulative gains but less acceleration over the period. The greatest advances were in matters of life and death. At least 20.9 million and as many as 30.3 million additional lives were saved due to accelerated rates of progress, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total. Primary school completion also showed considerable overall acceleration, leading to at least 74 million more children having finished primary school. Other measures of basic needs-including undernourishment, access to water and access to sanitation - showed mixed patterns of acceleration. Headcount rates of extreme income poverty declined at an accelerated rate in most regions. Environmental indicators showed no systematic evidence of faster progress. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Companies that could realize a cash windfall by selling equity stakes see an increase in the probability of acquiring another company by 14%. I find that these additional acquisitions destroy firm value. Following the tax reform, affected firms experience a decrease of 1.2 percentage points in acquisition announcement returns.
