We demonstrate that a standard residual-based bootstrap procedure cannot consistently estimate the distribution of the limited information maximum likelihood estimator or Fuller (1977) estimator under many/many weak instrument sequence. The primary reason is that the standard procedure fails to capture the instrument strength in the sample adequately. In addition, we consider the restricted efficient (RE) bootstrap of Davidson and MacKinnon (2008, 2010, 2014) that generates bootstrap data under the null (restricted) and uses an efficient estimator of the coefficient of the reduced-form equation (efficient). We find that the RE bootstrap is also invalid; however, it effectively mimics more key features in the limiting distributions of interest, and thus, is less distorted in finite samples than the standard bootstrap procedure. Finally, we propose modified bootstrap procedures that provide a valid distributional approximation for the two estimators with many/many weak instruments. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that hypothesis testing based on the asymptotic normal approximation can have severe size distortions in finite samples. Instead, our modified bootstrap procedures greatly reduce these distortions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By linking the Danish Longitudinal Survey on Ageing with individual hospital records covering all hospital admissions from 1995 to 2006, I show that SRH is correlated to historical, current, and future hospital records. I use both measures separately to control for health in a regression of mortality on wealth. Using only historical and current hospitalization controls for health yields the common result that SRH is a stronger predictor of mortality than objective health measures. The addition of future hospitalizations as controls shows that the estimated gradient on wealth is similar to one in which SRH is the control. The results suggest that with a sufficiently long time series of individual records, objective health measures can predict mortality to the same extent as global self-rated measures.

Methods: Two versions of a DCE questionnaire containing nine choice tasks were distributed among a representative sample of the Dutch population aged 55 to 65 years. The DCE consisted of four attributes related to the decision regarding participation in genetic screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). The risk attribute included was framed positively as the probability of surviving CRC and negatively as the probability of dying from CRC. Panel mixed-logit models were used to estimate the relative importance of the attributes. The data of the positively and negatively framed DCE were compared on the basis of direct attribute ranking, dominant decision-making behavior, preferences, and importance scores. Results: The majority (56%) of the respondents ranked survival as the most important attribute in the positively framed DCE, whereas only a minority (8%) of the respondents ranked mortality as the most important attribute in the negatively framed DCE. Respondents made dominant choices based on survival significantly more often than based on mortality. The framing of the risk attribute significantly influenced all attribute-level estimates and resulted in different preference structures among respondents in the positively and negatively framed data set. Conclusions: Risk framing affects how respondents value the presented risk. Positive risk framing led to increased dominant decision-making behavior, whereas negative risk framing led to risk seeking behavior. Attribute framing should have a prominent part in the expert and focus group interviews, and different types of framing should be used in the pilot version of DCEs as well as in actual DCEs to estimate the magnitude of the effect of choosing different types of framing.","[Veldwijk, Jorien; Lambooij, Mattijs S.; de Wit, G.

The nature of the programmes means that some effects are likely to occur outside the healthcare sector; this breadth impacts on the choice of health and non-health outcomes to measure and value in an economic evaluation. Employing conventional outcome measures in evaluations of public health has been questioned. There are concerns that such measures are too narrow, overlook important dimensions of programme effect and, thus, lead to such interventions being undervalued. This issue is of particular importance for low-income and middle-income countries, which face considerable budget constraints, yet deliver a large proportion of health activities within public health programmes. The need to develop outcome measures, which include broader measures of quality of life, has given impetus to the development of a variety of new, holistic approaches, including Sen's capability framework and measures of subjective wellbeing. Despite their promise, these approaches have not yet been widely applied, perhaps because they present significant methodological challenges. This paper outlines the methodological challenges for the identification and measurement of broader outcomes of public health interventions in economic evaluation in low-income and middle-income countries.","[Greco, Giulia] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Lorgelly, Paula] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Yamabhai, Inthira] Minist Publ Hlth, HITAP, Bangkok, Thailand",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Monash University; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand,"Greco, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England.",Giulia.Greco@lshtm.ac.uk,"Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012","Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514; Suya, Inthira/0000-0001-7054-2153; Greco, Giulia/0000-0002-5448-9521",MRC [MR/M014606/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/M014606/1] Funding Source: researchfish,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,65,30,34,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2016,25.0,,,1.0,,,83,94,,10.1002/hec.3302,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DB9TF,26804360.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368859100008,0

The presence of (environmental) inefficiency in by-production therefore means that more than this minimal amount of the undesirable output is produced. Similarly, the presence of technical inefficiency implies that, given inputs, less than the maximal possible amount of desirable outputs is produced. Alternatively, it means that more than the minimal amounts of inputs are used to produce a given level of desirable output. We use the by production technology approach which is a composition of production technology of desirable outputs and the technology of by-products, and estimate both technical and environmental efficiency. Given that electricity, the good output in our application, is demand determined, we treat it as exogenous and address the endogeneity of inputs by using the first-order conditions of cost minimization. Some of our models automatically take endogeneity of bad outputs into account. We use an efficient Bayesian MCMC technique to estimate both good and bad output technologies and both types of inefficiency. We also compare results with some alternative models with and without endogeneity corrections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Titratable acidity was statistically significant in all crops. Statistically significant values of total soluble solids were observed in the harvests of 2014 and 2015. The volatile acidity parameter showed statistical significance in the year 2014. The inherent genetic differences between the varieties of grapes used for each juice and the distinct technological processes used in the production are the factors that explain the results.","[Fongaro, Camila; Dalla Santa Spada, Patricia Kelly Wilmsen] Fac Serra Gaucha, Biomed Dept, Rua Os Dezoito Forte 2366, Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Cavagnolli, Natalia Ines] Univ Caxias Sul, Ave Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130, Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Fongaro, C (通讯作者)，Fac Serra Gaucha, Biomed Dept, Rua Os Dezoito Forte 2366, Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil.",,,,,,,,23,2,3,0,3,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1008.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701008,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700008,0

However, other climatic indices can be used for the same purpose. One of them is the Vineyard Water Indicator (VWI) that represents the ratio between the total rainfall and the vineyard water requirement during the productive period of the culture. When compared to DI, the VWI presents a simpler calculation methodology. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish a model to estimate DI based on VWI values. Climate data of 80 winegrowing regions in 18 countries were used. Four regression models were evaluated: linear, quadratic, logarithmic and the Mitscherlich model. Real and simulated data were compared using the confidence coefficient (c) that corresponds to the product of the correlation coefficient (r) by the exactness coefficient (d). The best fit was obtained employing the quadratic model and DI can be calculated using the following equation: DI = -363.84 VWI2 + 834.47 VWI - 257.17 (R-2 = 0.93), for VHI < 0.905. For VHI values equal to or greater than 0.905, DI is constant and equal to 200.","[Fonseca Conceicao, Marco Antonio; de Souza, Reginaldo Teodoro] Embrapa Grape & Wine, Trop Viticulture Expt Stn, Jales, SP, Brazil; [Tonietto, Jorge] Embrapa Grape & Wine, Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Conceiçao, MAF (通讯作者)，Embrapa Grape & Wine, Trop Viticulture Expt Stn, Jales, SP, Brazil.",,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,0,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1037.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701037,0.0,,,2,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700037,0

During 120 wine aging days several phenolic parameters were analyzed (including several individual phenolic compounds by HPLC) and also the sensorial characteristics of the wines. Wines treated with oenological tannins showed higher total phenols and flavonoid phenols and lesser color degradation during the aging time considered. After 120 aging days, wines aged with oenological tannins showed more total and individual anthocyanins and significantly more red color that induced significantly color differences in relation to the untreated wine (especially for the wines treated with condensed tannins). From a sensorial point of view it was also possible to detect a clear differentiation between the wines.","[Jordao, Antonio M.; Fontes, Luis; Correia, Ana C.] Escola Super Agr, Inst Politecn Viseu CI&DETS, P-3500606 Viseu, Portugal; [Muxagata, Sara; Nunes, Fernando M.] UTAD Escola Ciencias Vida & Ambiente, CQ VR, Dept Quim, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Muxagata, Sara; Cosme, Fernando] UTAD Escola Ciencias Vida & Ambiente, CQ VR, Dept Biol & Ambiente, Edificio Enol, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal",,"Jordao, AM (通讯作者)，Escola Super Agr, Inst Politecn Viseu CI&DETS, P-3500606 Viseu, Portugal.",antoniojordao@esav.ipv.pt,"Jordao, Alceu Afonso/D-7545-2014; Nunes, Fernando/B-3003-2012","Nunes, Fernando/0000-0001-5540-318X",,,,,16,1,1,1,6,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2032.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702032,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700076,0

A study on the flavonol composition of grape skins in several wild grapevine genotypes from different Iberian natural populations, preserved at El Encin Germoplasm Bank, has been carried out in 2012. Flavonol glycosides contained in grape skins were determined by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS, through a previous phase of purification, using ion exchange chromatographic columns to retain anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds, so that flavonols do not suffer co-elution with other components, improving HPLC analysis. Thus, it was possible to separate 12 flavonol glycosides, and eight of them were successfully identified. The major flavonols were quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoronide and myricetin-3-O-glucoside. The diversity and number of flavonols differed for each genotype. The total content of flavonols ranged from 25 to 350 mg/kg grapes; the richest genotype was three times richer than Tempranillo grapes, used as a reference. The most significant difference between wild genotypes and reference cultivars was that, in many cases, myricetin-3-O-glucoside or quercetin-3-Oglucuronide predominated in wild genotypes.","[Revilla, Eugenio; Yus, Joaquin; Ortiz, Patricia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Quim Agr & Bromatol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Bellido, Alberto; Carrasco, David; Arroyo, Rosa A.] CBGP UPM INIA, Dept Biotecnol, Campus Montegancedo, Pozuelo De Alarcon 28223, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Investigacion en Biotecnologia Genomica de Plantas (CBGP),"Revilla, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Quim Agr & Bromatol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",,"Yus, Joaquin/E-9400-2019","Yus, Joaquin/0000-0002-9457-4042",,,,,21,0,0,0,8,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1018.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701018,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700018,0

Objectives: To examine BRA metrics for prospective monitoring of new drugs in electronic health care data. Methods: Using two electronic health care databases, we emulated prospective monitoring of three drugs (rofecoxib vs. nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prasugrel vs. clopidogrel, and denosumab vs. bisphosphonates) using a sequential propensity score-matched cohort design. We applied four BRA metrics: number needed to treat and number needed to harm; incremental net benefit (INB) with maximum acceptable risk; INB with relative-value-adjusted life-years; and INB with quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). We determined whether and when the bootstrapped 99% confidence interval (CI) for each metric excluded zero, indicating net favorability of one drug over the other. Results: For rofecoxib, all four metrics yielded a negative value, suggesting net favorability of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs over rofecoxib, and the 99% CI for all but the number needed to treat and number needed to harm excluded the null during follow-up. For prasugrel, only the 99% CI for INB-QALY excluded the null, but trends in values over time were similar across the four metrics, suggesting overall net favorability of prasugrel versus clopidogrel. The 99% CI for INB-relative-value-adjusted life-years and INB-QALY excluded the null in the denosumab example, suggesting net favorability of denosumab over bisphosphonates. Conclusions: Prospective benefit-risk monitoring can be used to determine net favorability of a new drug in electronic health care data. In three examples, existing BRA metrics produced qualitatively similar results but differed with respect to alert generation.","[Gagne, Joshua J.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Choudhry, Niteesh K.; Rogers, James R.; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Gagne, Joshua J.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Choudhry, Niteesh K.; Rogers, James R.; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Martin, Diane P.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kahler, Kristijan H.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Novartis,"Gagne, JJ (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",jgagne1@partners.org,"Bykov, Katsiaryna/JRZ-1072-2023; Schneeweiss, Sebastian/C-2125-2013","Bykov, Katsiaryna/0000-0003-3336-5412; Schneeweiss, Sebastian/0000-0003-2575-467X",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),This study was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation to the Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Cost-effectiveness of treatment groups (drug classes) using community-level effectiveness and cost data, however, has not been assessed for elderly patients with breast cancer. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens by age and disease stage under real-world conditions for patients with breast cancer. Methods: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data were used to identify patients with breast cancer with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I/II/IIIa, hormone receptor-negative (estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative) patients from 1992 to 2009. Patients were categorized into three adjuvant treatment groups: 1) no chemotherapy, 2) anthracycline, and 3) non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Median life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were measured using Kaplan-Meier analysis and were evaluated against average total health care costs (2013 US dollars). Results: A total of 4575 patients (propensity score-matched) were included for the primary analysis. The anthracycline group experienced 12.05 QALYs and mean total health care costs of $119,055, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,688 per QALY gained as compared with the no chemotherapy group (QALYs 7.81; average health care cost $86,383). The non-anthracycline-based group was dominated by the anthracycline group with lower QALYs (9.56) and higher health care costs ($122,791). Base-case results were found to be consistent with the best-case and worst-case scenarios for utility assignments. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied by age group (range $3,790-$90,405 per QALY gained). Conclusions: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy was found cost-effective for elderly patients with early stage (stage I, II, IIIa) breast cancer considering the US threshold of $100,000 per QALY.

An Edgeworth expansion is developed for the maximum likelihood estimate of the spatial correlation coefficient. The expansion is used to develop more accurate interval estimates for the coefficient, and tests for cross-sectional independence that have better size properties, than corresponding rules of statistical inference based on first order asymptotic theory. Comparisons of finite sample performance are carried out using Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

An excluded regressor for a player i is a sufficiently varying state variable that does not affect other players' utility and is additively separable from other components in i's payoff. Such excluded regressors arise in various empirical contexts. Our identification method is constructive, and provides a basis for nonparametric estimators. For a semiparametric model with linear payoffs, we propose root-N consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for players' payoffs. We also discuss extension to the case with multiple Bayesian Nash equilibria in the data-generating process without assuming equilibrium selection rules. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Trastuzumab was approved for use in 1998, but the life-years saved from first-line use are unknown, as are the potential US population benefits from adding pertuzumab. Objectives: The first aim was to estimate the number of life-years saved by using first-line trastuzumab between 1999 and 2013 in HER2 women with MBC. In addition, based on these estimates, the second aim was to project the life-years that could be saved by adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in first-line therapy. Methods: We constructed a simulation model accounting for incidence, testing rates, therapy utilization, and overall survival. The model was run for 1999 to 2013 (15 years) to estimate the life-years saved from using trastuzumab plus chemotherapy instead of chemotherapy alone. The model was also run from 2013 to 2027 (15 years) to project the life-years that might be saved by adding pertuzumab. Uncertainty was incorporated using Monte Carlo methods. Results: The estimated number of women with HER2 MBC varied over time, with the peak of 9700 in 2005 and the low of 7700 in 2018. The cumulative incremental life-years saved because of first-line trastuzumab use from 1999 to 2013 was estimated to be 156,413 (95% simulation interval 114,840-195,201). The projection for pertuzumab from 2013 to 2027 was 137,959 (95% simulation interval 56,011-225,069). Exploratory analyses of value showed that pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy is associated with a $1.10 billion gain compared with chemotherapy alone, and adding pertuzumab is associated with a $0.06 billion gain compared with trastuzumab with chemotherapy. Conclusions: This simulation model suggests that substantial progress has been made in treating HER2 women over the past 15 years, and the future may witness similar gains with the introduction of pertuzumab.","[Danese, Mark D.; Lee, Abraham] Outcomes Insights Inc, Westlake Village, CA USA; [Masaquel, Anthony; Santos, Eduardo; Brammer, Melissa] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Lalla, Deepa] Palo Alto Outcomes Res, Palo Alto, CA USA",Roche Holding; Genentech,"Danese, MD (通讯作者)，2801 Townsgate Rd,Suite 330, Westlake Village, CA 91361 USA.",mark@outins.com,,,"Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","Outcomes Insights, Inc., is a for-profit organization that provides research and consulting services, and was funded by Genentech, Inc., to conduct this research.

We provide new evidence that the expected return variation and the variance risk premium positively forecast both short-horizon returns and dividend growth rates. We also confirm that dividend yield positively forecasts long-horizon returns, but that it does not help in forecasting dividend growth rates. Our equilibrium-based structural factor GARCH model permits much more accurate inference than univariate regression procedures traditionally employed in the literature. The model also allows for the direct estimation of the underlying economic mechanisms, including a new volatility leverage effect, the persistence of the latent long-run growth component and the two latent volatility factors, as well as the contemporaneous impacts of the underlying structural shocks.

The payoff generated by each coalition is determined by an exogenous partition function (the parameter space). We show that in almost all games, except in a set of measure zero of the parameter space, the Markov perfect equilibrium value of coalitions and the state transition probability that describe the path of coalition formation is locally unique and stable. Therefore, comparative statics analysis are well-defined and can be performed using standard calculus tools. Global uniqueness does not hold in general, but the number of equilibria is finite and odd. In addition, a sufficient condition for global uniqueness is derived, and using this sufficient condition we show that there is a globally unique equilibrium in three-player superadditive games.

In each period, new young talents enter the set. We find that if K is infinite the problem is indexable. However, the index we find is different from that of Gittins, and is easier to be implemented. If K is finite the problem is not indexable. In that case, we solve partially the problem. Under some condition, we develop a criterion to compare two talents.

Methods: The survey was conducted in March 2013. Our sample was drawn from patients with diabetes at five hospitals in Taiwan (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 250). The sample size was 838 patients. The discrete choice experiment questionnaire included the attributes monthly cash rewards, exercise time, diet control, and program duration. We estimated a bivariate probit model to derive willingness-to-accept levels after accounting for the characteristics (e.g., severity and comorbidity) of patients with diabetes. Results: The prefemed program was a 3-year program involving 30 minutes of exercise per day and flexible diet control. Offering an incentive of approximately US $67 in cash per month appears to increase the likelihood that patients with diabetes will participate in the preferred P4P4P program by approximately 50%. Conclusions: Patients with more disadvantageous characteristics (e.g., elderly, low income, greater comorbidity, and severity) could have less to gain from participating in the program and thus require a higher monetary incentive to compensate for the disutility caused by participating in the program's activities. Our result demonstrates that a modest financial incentive could increase the likelihood of program participation after accounting for the attributes of the P4P4P program and patients' characteristics.

We find simulated annealing dominates gradient methods for recovering true models. We recommend a partially flexible step function for duration dependence combined with likelihood ratio tests for determining support points of unobserved heterogeneity. We find that ignoring time-changing features of explanatory variables introduces substantial biases in model coefficient and average partial effect estimates. These biases do not diminish as sample size increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a strategy that combines propensity score matching with a difference-in-differences approach to address selection bias. Results show that the NCMS has significantly improved the elderly enrollees' activities of daily living and cognitive function but has not led to better self-assessed general health status. We find no significant effect of NCMS on mortality for the previously uninsured elderly in NCMS counties, although there is moderate evidence that it is associated with reduced mortality for the elderly enrollees. We also find that the elderly participants are more likely to get adequate medical services when sick, which provides a good explanation for the beneficial health effects of NCMS. However, there is no evidence that the NCMS has reduced their out-of-pocket spending. Furthermore, we also find that low-income seniors benefit more from NCMS participation in terms of health outcomes and perceived access to health care, suggesting that the NCMS helps reduce health inequalities among the rural elderly.

After 19years, young adults may become ineligible for Medicaid. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we find that the resulting loss of Medicaid coverage causes substantial changes to the level and composition of health care use. The total number of visits to health care providers falls by over 60%, two-thirds of which is due to a decline in office visits. Expenditures, in particular inpatient expenditures, also appear to fall sharply.

The solution rationalizes why the empirical association between income and life satisfaction is approximately log-linear. I show that the solution is observationally equivalent when individuals compare their consumption (i) with others, (ii) with their own past consumption achievements, and (iii) not at all (ordinary preferences). This finding suggests that the observed slope of the income life satisfaction curve is uninformative about the presence and strength of habits or reference-dependent utility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We consider tests for the null hypotheses of no linear and quadratic serial residual autocorrelation, residual symmetry, and no structural breaks. We also apply our method to backtesting Value-at-Risk. For these tests we show that, generally, no size correction is needed in the asymptotic test distribution when applied to AR-GARCH residuals obtained through Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood estimation. To be precise, we give exact expressions for the limiting null distribution of the test statistics applied to (standardized) residuals, and find that standard critical values often, though not always, lead to conservative tests. For this result, we give simple necessary and sufficient conditions. Simulations show that our asymptotic approximations work well for a large number of AR-GARCH models and parameter values. We also show that the rank-based tests often, though not always, have superior power properties over the classical tests, even if they are conservative. An empirical application illustrates the relevance of these tests to the AR-GARCH models for weekly stock market return indices of some major and emerging countries.

It weighs observations such that many-instruments consistency is guaranteed while the signal component in the data is maintained. We show that this results in a smaller signal component in the many instruments asymptotic variance when compared to estimators that neglect a part of the signal to achieve consistency. Both many strong instruments and many weak instruments asymptotic distributions are derived using high-level assumptions that allow for instruments with identifying power that varies between explanatory variables. Standard errors are formulated compactly.

The EF approach is distinctly different from other health economic approaches. Here, we evaluate established tools for assessing and communicating parameter uncertainty in terms of their applicability to the EF approach. Among these are tools that perform the following: (i) graphically display overall uncertainty within the IQWiG EF (scatter plots, confidence bands, and contour plots) and (ii) communicate the uncertainty around the reimbursable price. We found that, within the EF approach, most established plots were not always easy to interpret. Hence, we propose the use of price reimbursement acceptability curves-a modification of the well-known cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Furthermore, it emerges that the net monetary benefit allows an intuitive interpretation of parameter uncertainty within the EF approach. This research closes a gap for handling uncertainty in the economic evaluation approach of the IQWiG methods when using the EF. However, the precise consequences of uncertainty when determining prices are yet to be defined. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Since the marginal effects are often of primary interest and are difficult to recover in a semiparametric setting, we focus on developing an estimator for the marginal effects. This marginal effect estimator uses only observations where the selection probability is above a certain threshold. A key innovation is that this high probability set is adaptive to the data. We establish the large sample properties of the marginal effect estimator as well as those for an index estimator upon which it depends. Monte Carlo studies show that these estimators perform well in finite samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate is associated with a 1.67 percentage point (2.12%) reduction in the probability that men have health insurance; this effect is strongest among college-educated, white, and older (50-64years old) men. For women and children, health insurance coverage is not significantly correlated with the unemployment rate, which may be the result of public health insurance acting as a social safety net. Compared with the previous recession, the health insurance coverage of men is more sensitive to the unemployment rate, which may be due to the nature of the Great Recession.

In the current years of distinct product differentiation, Crete has been re-examining the strategic road to a fruitful future and a secured position in the international tourism market. Amongst proposals promising to redirect the local offer towards a more sustainable as well as competitive tourism product is that of sport tourism due to a diverse physical environment of infinite potential for sport holidays. The focus of the present study is placed on the response of the local tourism industry and its sensitivity towards sport-related tourism products. Local tourism businesses' acceptability to thematic tourism products remains the most crucial factor for a successful sport tourism development. As early as 1982 sport tourism has been suggested as a strong and competitive alternative to the diminishing and unsustainable mass tourism model developed in the Mediterranean (Glyptis. Sport and tourism in Western Europe. London: British Travel Education Trust, 1982). However, limited attention has been placed on the businesses' perspectives in embracing similar initiatives and overall the level of willingness the private tourism sector demonstrates in encompassing these products in the tourism offer (Vrondou et al. e-Review of Tourism Research (eRTR) 7(1): 126, 2009). Examples of successful sport tourism projects have been recorded worldwide (Weed and Bull. Sports tourism: Participants, policy and providers. Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann, 2009) but scarcely tourism businesses perspectives on accommodating sport tourism products have been analysed. Crete represents a typical mass tourism destination in the process of quality differentiation in order to face a stagnating environment. The study examines Crete as a traditional destination in its effort to disembark from the mass tourism model towards a more specialised and quality tourism offer. Government initiatives promise to support a more quality tourism product supporting local environment but how is this received by the sceptical tourism sector having already invested a vast amount of resources to previous tourism tactics?","[Gaitanakis, Leonidas] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Sport Management, Ierapetra 72200, Crete, Greece; [Vrondou, Ourania; Kriemadis, Thanos; Douvis, Giannis] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Sport Management, Sparta 23100, Greece",University of Peloponnese,"Gaitanakis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Sport Management, Ierapetra 72200, Crete, Greece.",gaitanakisleon@gmail.com; ovrondou@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,349,351,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_29,0.0,,,3,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000028,0

This work presents the analysis of the influence of compost amendment on heavy metals transport to the plant Lactuca sativa L. grown in contaminated soils. To demonstrate the effect of compost, a pot experiment was performed. Eight variants of soils with different concentrations of pollutants with and without compost amendment were prepared. The contaminated soils we used in our experiment come from the Nord France region Noyelles-Godault. Main pollutants were Pb, Cd and Zn. The decrease of heavy metals content in plants was observed by the simultaneous applications of compost to contaminated soils, from 10% to 50% in comparison with the variants without compost amendment. The BCF (bioconcentration factor) gives a clear view on reduced uptake of HM (heavy metal) by plant. Based on these results, we conclude that application of organic waste compost has positive effect on immobilization and bioavailability of heavy metals.","[Kubna, Daniela; Elbl, Jakub; Plosek, Lukas] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kubna, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xkubna@node.mendelu.cz,"Elbl, Jakub/I-5056-2018","Elbl, Jakub/0000-0001-6401-1516",,,,,17,5,5,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100047,0

After the visit they share information with others. Therefore, a reasonable diffusion with information and communication technologies (ICTs) can benefit both the tourists as well as the businesses. However, disparities still exist in access, skills, use of and attitudes towards ICTs. Although, the phenomenon of digital divide has been addressed in several studies, especially with regard to small and medium sized tourism enterprises, research on the adoption and implementation of ICTs in cultural and heritage tourism is still scant.

This is an opportunity as well as a challenge for the hospitality education system in Vietnam. The purpose of this study is to identify the needs of hospitality industry for graduate market in Vietnam to examine the supply of the hospitality graduate student in meeting this demand whether this relationship is a match or mismatch. Together with a critical literature review, data were collected through two different interview sets. Students who are attending 10 different hospitality schools in Vietnam will be interviewed toward their evaluation and satisfaction of their schools. At the same time, another interview set was conducted to identify opinions of the local market upon the graduate supply. It is concluded that there is a huge gap between the hospitality graduate supply and the market demand. The main reason address was the inexperience and unprofessional of the graduates that prevent them entering the market.

When a production cost disruption occurs, the original production plan and coordination scheme designed for the initially estimated production cost need to be revised. To resolve these issues, it is necessary to explicitly consider possible related deviation costs caused by any changes of the original production plan. How to model the production cost disruptions and their effects, and how to design a coordination scheme with disruptions is discussed. The results show that the original production plan and quantity discount contract have demonstrated some robustness under disruptions. It is beneficial for the central decision-maker to take timely response to the disruptions and utilize the revised strategy under disruptions. We also find that the optimal pricing decisions are affected by customers' preference for the direct channel and the scale of disruption.

The model allows the mean-reversion speed and the volatility of volatility to be highly sensitive to the actual level of VXX. Factors such as jumps and the default risk are also taken into consideration. In particular, the positive volatility skew is addressed by the jump-to-default extended 3/2 plus jumps model. Daily calibration is used to check whether the model fits the market prices and generates the positive volatility skew.

Methods: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to simulate the progress of Australian patients with BRAF-AM. The model had a 10-year time horizon with outcomes discounted at 5% annually. For the nivolumab group, risks of progression and death were based on those observed in the nivolumab arm of a phase III trial (nivolumab vs. dacarbazine). Progression-free survival and overall survival were extrapolated using parametric survival modeling with a log-logistic distribution. In the absence of head-to-head evidence, overall survival and progression free survival for ipilimumab were estimated on the basis of an indirect comparison using published data. Costs of managing AM were estimated from a survey of Australian clinicians. The cost of ipilimumab was based on the reimbursement price in Australia. The cost of nivolumab was based on expected reimbursement prices in Australia. Quality-of-life data were obtained within the trial using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Results: Compared with ipilimumab, nivolumab therapy over 10 years was estimated to yield 1.58 life-years and 1.30 quality-adjusted life-years per person, at a (discounted) net cost of US $39,039 per person. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for nivolumab compared with ipilimumab were US $25,101 per year of life saved and $30,475 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Conclusions: Nivolumab is a cost-effective means of preventing downstream mortality and morbidity in patients with AM compared with ipilimumab in the Australian setting.","[Bohensky, Megan A.; Pasupathi, Kumar; Gorelik, Alexandra; Liew, Danny] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne EpiCtr, Level & Block E, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia; [Bohensky, Megan A.; Pasupathi, Kumar; Gorelik, Alexandra; Liew, Danny] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Kim, Hansoo; Harrison, James P.] Bristol Myers Squibb Australia, Mulgrave, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Hospital; University of Melbourne; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Bohensky, MA (通讯作者)，Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne EpiCtr, Level & Block E, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia.",megan.bohensky@unimelb.edu.au,"Gorelik, Alexandra/Z-6361-2019; bohensky, megan a/H-4743-2011","Gorelik, Alexandra/0000-0003-1032-0457; Kim, Hansoo/0000-0002-3710-8619",,,,,45,19,19,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,1009,1015,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.013,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987627.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300014,0

Building on the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure, we construct a pilot HIPM for the under-65 population under ACA-like health reform in Massachusetts. This pilot demonstrates the practicality, face validity and value of a HIPM. Results suggest that public health insurance benefits and premium subsidies accounted for a substantial, one-third reduction in the health inclusive poverty rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

But our societies are also characterized, since the 1970s, by a postponement of births, which, by raising the intergenerational age gap, can affect the provision of LTC by children. In order to examine the impact of those demographic trends on the optimal policy, we develop a four period OLG model where individuals, who receive children's informal LTC at the old age, must choose, when being young, how to allocate births along their life cycle. It is shown that, in line with empirical evidence, early children provide more LTC to their elderly parents than do late children, because they face a lower opportunity cost of providing LTC. When comparing the laissez-faire with the long-run social optimum, it appears that individuals have, at the laissez-faire, too few early births, and too many late births. We then study, in first-best and second-best settings, how the social optimum can be decentralized by encouraging early births, in such a way as to reduce the social burden of LTC provision.

Here, we discuss in detail several properties of this key feature of recurrent interaction and derive relationships. This allows us to elucidate different notions of selfconfirming equilibrium, showing how they are related to each other given the properties of information feedback. In particular, we focus on Maxmin selfconfirming equilibrium, which assumes extreme ambiguity aversion, and we compare it with the partially-specified-probabilities (PSP) equilibrium of Lehrer (2012). Assuming that players can implement any randomization, symmetric Maxmin selfconfirming equilibrium exists under either observable payoffs, or separable feedback. The latter assumption makes this equilibrium concept essentially equivalent to PSP-equilibrium. If observability of payoffs holds as well, then these equilibrium concepts collapse to mixed Nash equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A previous Markov model cost-effectiveness study on Egyptian patients aged 50-60 years demonstrated that the combined therapy reduces the overall treatment cost. However, due to the lack of actual real-world data on cost-effectiveness and the limitation of the Markov model study to 50- to 60-year-old patients, the Egyptian medical community is still questioning whether the added benefit is worth the cost. Objective To assess, from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the cost-effectiveness of the combined use of warfarin and low-dose aspirin (75 mg) versus that of warfarin alone in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses who began therapy between the age of 15 and 50 years. Methods An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combined therapy in patients with mechanical valve prostheses. A total of 316 patients aged between 15 and 50 years were included in the study and randomly assigned to a group treated with both warfarin and aspirin or a group treated with warfarin alone. Results The patients in the combined therapy group exhibited a significantly longer duration of protection against the first event. Fewer primary events were observed in the patients treated with warfarin plus aspirin than in those treated with warfarin alone (1.4 %/year, vs. 4.8 %/year), and a higher mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) value over 4 years was obtained for the group treated with warfarin plus aspirin (difference 0.058; 95 % CI 0.013-0.118), although this difference did not reach a conventional level of statistical significance. The total costs over a 4-year period were lower with the combined therapy (difference -US$244; 95 % CI -US$483.1 to -US$3.8), which yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$4206 per QALY gained. Thus, the combined therapy was dominant. All costs were reported in US dollars (USD) for the financial year 2014. Conclusions The results of this analysis indicate that from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the addition of aspirin to the typical warfarin therapy is more effective and less costly for patients with mechanical valve prostheses than treatment with warfarin alone. This combined strategy could be adopted to prevent the complications of mechanical valve prostheses. Our study adds to the body of evidence supporting the option of warfarin-plus-aspirin therapy for patients with mechanical valve prostheses.","[El-Hamamsy, Manal H.] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt; [Elsisi, Gihan H.] German Univ Cairo, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt; [Elsisi, Gihan H.] Cent Adm Pharmaceut Affairs, Pharmacoecon Unit, Cairo, Egypt; [Eldessouki, Randa] Fayoum Univ, Fac Med, Al Fayyum, Egypt; [Elmazar, Mohamed M.] British Univ Egypt, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt; [Taha, Ahmed S.; Awad, Basma F.] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Med, Cairo, Egypt; [Taha, Ahmed S.; Awad, Basma F.] Ain Shams Univ Hosp, Cardiothorac Surg Unit, Cairo, Egypt; [Elmansy, Hossam] Canadian Int Coll, Fac Business Adm, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); German University in Cairo; B Braun Melsungen; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Fayoum University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); British University in Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Canadian International College (CIC),"Elsisi, GH (通讯作者)，German Univ Cairo, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt.;Elsisi, GH (通讯作者)，Cent Adm Pharmaceut Affairs, Pharmacoecon Unit, Cairo, Egypt.",gihanhamdyelsisi@hotmail.com,"Elsisi, Gihan/ABE-8471-2020; Elmazar, M Mohey/GYQ-9603-2022; Eldessouki, Randa/JTV-0611-2023; El-Hamamsy, Manal/B-9851-2019","Elmazar, M Mohey/0000-0002-5076-9817; Eldessouki, Randa/0000-0003-3942-1489;",,,,,22,2,3,0,0,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Our results are validated by comparison with equivalent contingent valuation values for marginal willingness to pay and marginal willingness to accept compensation for changes in job characteristics.

Specifically, our modeling approach allows for MIDAS stochastic volatility dynamics, generalizing a large literature focusing on MIDAS effects in the conditional mean, and allows the models to be estimated by means of standard Gibbs sampling methods. When applied to monthly time series on growth in industrial production and inflation, we find strong evidence that the introduction of MIDAS effects in the volatility equation leads to improved in-sample and out-of-sample density forecasts. Our results also suggest that model combination schemes assign high weight to MIDAS in-volatility models and produce consistent gains in out-of-sample predictive performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The estimator is simple but possesses desirable statistical properties including consistency, asymptotic normality and the parametric rate of convergence in the presence of persistent, diurnally heteroskedastic and endogenous microstructure effects. It is robust to the asynchronous trading of multiple securities with persistent and endogenous refresh-time durations. I also prove the consistency of a subsampling-based estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the proposed estimator. In simulations, the non-linear functions of the proposed estimator exhibit smaller bias than those based on a realized kernel, while only slightly increasing the variance. Thereby, the proposed estimator reduces the mean squared error. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, with its creation comes a new decision problem, how to best allocate resources among cancer drugs. Objectives: Our objective was to estimate CDF's willingness and ability to pay for cancer drugs, providing guidance regarding where CDF funds are best spent, and determining the number of NHS quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) displaced through the existence of the fund. Methods: Using CDF utilization figures, cost-per-QALY, and treatment episode costs from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence health technology assessment reports, the league-table approach was applied to determine appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds to inform the CDF's decision making. Results: The CDF exhibits a willingness-to-pay value of 223,627 per QALY, with 74% and 33% of expenditure for drugs with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of more than 50,000 and more than 90,000, respectively. During 2013-2014, CDF expenditure generated 4,677 QALYs, compared with a potential 13,485 if the same funds were used as part of routine NHS commissioning, displacing 8,808 QALYs. By ring fencing 10%, 25%, and 50% of the CDF budget for the provision of unevaluated drugs, cost-effectiveness thresholds of 149,000, 111,400, and 68,600 were calculated, respectively. Conclusions: Adopting the proposed framework for CDF prioritization would result in disinvestment from a number of highly cost-ineffective drugs applicable for CDF reimbursement.

The value of a coalition is obtained under the behavioral assumption that left-out players do not react strategically to the formation of that coalition, but stick to their Nash equilibrium actions in the n-player noncooperative game. This assumption has huge computational merit, especially in games where each player is described by a large-scale mathematical program. For the class of games with multilateral externalities discussed in Chander and Tulkens, we show that the delta characteristic function is superadditive and has a nonempty core, and that the delta-core is a subset of the gamma-core.

In addition, the effects of alternative stochastic frontier model specification on the empirical results are examined. Methods We conducted a stochastic frontier analysis to estimate the country-level technical efficiencies using secondary panel data for 20 MENA countries for the period of 1995-2012 from the World Bank database. We also tested the effect of alternative frontier model specification using three random-effects approaches: a time-invariant model where efficiency effects are assumed to be static with regard to time, and a time-varying efficiency model where efficiency effects have temporal variation, and one model to account for heterogeneity. Results The average estimated technical inefficiency of health systems in the MENA region was 6.9 % with a range of 5.7-7.9 % across the three models. Among the top performers, Lebanon, Qatar, and Morocco are ranked consistently high according to the three different inefficiency model specifications. On the opposite side, Sudan, Yemen and Djibouti ranked among the worst performers. On average, the two most technically efficient countries were Qatar and Lebanon. We found that the estimated technical efficiency scores vary substantially across alternative parametric models. Conclusion Based on the findings reported in this study, most MENA countries appear to be operating, on average, with a reasonably high degree of technical efficiency compared with other countries in the region. However, there is evidence to suggest that there are considerable efficiency gains yet to be made by some MENA countries. Additional empirical research is needed to inform future health policies aimed at improving both the efficiency and sustainability of the health systems in the MENA region.","[Hamidi, Samer] Hamdan Bin Mohammad Smart Univ, Sch Hlth & Environm Studies, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Akinci, Fevzi] Kings Coll, Hlth Care Adm, William G McGowan Sch Business, Wilkes Barre, PA USA",,"Hamidi, S (通讯作者)，Hamdan Bin Mohammad Smart Univ, Sch Hlth & Environm Studies, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",s.hamidi@hbmsu.ac.ae; fevziakinci@kings.edu,,"Hamidi, Samer/0000-0002-6766-3728",,,,,39,13,13,0,7,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

However, many evaluations have been criticised for failing to capture features of vaccines which are relevant to decision makers. These include broader societal benefits (such as improved educational achievement, economic growth and political stability), reduced health disparities, medical innovation, reduced hospital beds pressures, greater peace of mind and synergies in economic benefits with non-vaccine interventions. Also, the fiscal implications of vaccination programmes are not always made explicit. Alternative methodological frameworks have been proposed to better capture these benefits. However, any broadening of the methodology for economic evaluation must also involve evaluations of non-vaccine interventions, and hence may not always benefit vaccines given a fixed health-care budget. The scope of an economic evaluation must consider the budget from which vaccines are funded, and the decision-maker's stated aims for that spending to achieve.","[Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, 61 Colindale Ave, London NW9 6BT, England; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Hutubessy, Raymond] World Hlth Org, Initiat Vaccine Res, 20 Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland",Public Health England; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; World Health Organization,"Jit, M (通讯作者)，Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, 61 Colindale Ave, London NW9 6BT, England.;Jit, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",mark.jit@phe.gov.uk,"Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022","Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255",World Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline,World Health Organization(World Health Organization),,,62,20,21,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Methods: A state transition model compared treating women with TNBC with current clinical practice and four biomarker strategies to personalize HDAC: 1) BRCA1-like profile by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) testing; 2) BRCA1-like profile by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) testing; 3) strategy 1 followed by X-inactive specific transcript gene (XIST) and tumor suppressor p53 binding protein (53BP1) testing; and 4) strategy 2 followed by XIST and 53BP1 testing, from a Dutch societal perspective and a 20-year time horizon. Input data came from literature and expert opinions. We assessed the expected value of partial perfect information, the expected value of sample information, and the expected net benefit of sampling for potential ancillary studies of an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT; NCT01057069). Results: The expected value of partial perfect information indicated that further research should be prioritized to the parameter group including biomarkers' prevalence, positive predictive value (PPV), and treatment response rates (TRRs) in biomarker-negative patients and patients with TNBC ((sic)639 million), followed by utilities ((sic)48 million), costs ((sic)40 million), and transition probabilities (TPs) ((sic)30 million). By setting up four ancillary studies to the ongoing RCT, data on 1) TP and MLPA prevalence, PPV, and TRR; 2) aCGH and aCGH/MLPA plus XIST and 53BP1 prevalence, PPV, and TRR; 3) utilities; and 4) costs could be simultaneously collected (optimal size = 3000). Conclusions: Further research on predictive biomarkers for HDAC should focus on gathering data on TPs, prevalence, PPV, TRRs, utilities, and costs from the four ancillary studies to the ongoing RCT.","[Miquel-Cases, Anna; Retel, Valesca P.; van Harten, Wim H.] Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hosp NKI AVL, Netherlands Canc Inst, Dept Psychosocial Res & Epidemiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Harten, Wim H.] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Steuten, Lotte M.

Improved risk stratification may help to reduce costs and improve the cost effectiveness of ICDs. Objective To estimate the potential outcomes, costs, and cost effectiveness of using iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (I-mIBG) to screen HF patients eligible for an ICD. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to compare screening with I-mIBG imaging and no screening over 2-year and 10-year time horizons from a US payer perspective. Data on I-mIBG imaging and risk stratification were obtained from the ADMIRE-HF/HFX (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) trial. Data on ICD effectiveness for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) were obtained from a meta-analysis. Costs of ICDs and costs of generator and lead procedures were obtained from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Inpatient Sample. Age-specific mortality was modeled using US life tables and data from the ACT (Advancements in ICD Therapy) Registry on risks of SCD and non-SCD mortality. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results In the analysis, screening with I-mIBG imaging was associated with a reduction in ICD utilization of 21 %, resulting in a number needed to screen to prevent 1 ICD implantation of 5. Screening reduced the costs per patient by US$5500 and US$13,431 (in 2013 dollars) over 2 and 10 years, respectively, in comparison with no screening and resulted in losses of 0.001 and 0.040 life-years, respectively, over 2 and 10 years. Screening was decrementally cost effective, with savings of US$5,248,404 and US$513,036 per quality-adjusted life-year lost over 2 and 10 years, respectively. In subgroup analyses, cost savings were greater for patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-35 % than for those with an EF <25 %. Conclusions According to the model, screening of guideline-eligible patients selected for ICDs with I-mIBG imaging may be cost effective and may help reduce costs associated with implantation of ICDs, with a minimal impact on survival.","[O'Day, Ken] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Levy, Wayne C.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, Meridith; Jacobson, Arnold F.] GE Healthcare US, Princeton, NJ USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; General Electric","O'Day, K (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",ken.oday@xcenda.com,,"Levy, Wayne/0000-0003-1530-2194",,,,,36,14,15,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Risk aversion is expected to reduce the incentive to innovate and we might fear that without insurance innovation completely disappears in the long run. The present paper introduces risk averse agents into an occupational choice model of endogenous growth in which insurance against failure to innovate is not available. We derive a clear negative relationship between the level of risk aversion and long run growth. Surprisingly, we show that in an equilibrium there exists a cut-off value of risk aversion below which the growth rate of the mass of innovators tends to a strictly positive constant. In this case, innovation persists on the long run and consumption per capita grows at a strictly positive rate. On the other hand, for levels of risk aversion above the cut-off value, the economy eventually stagnates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Parents choose the language(s) to raise their children based on the communicational value of each language as well as on their emotional attachment to the languages at hand. Languages are thus conceptualized as tools for communication as well as carriers of cultural identity. The model includes a high and a low status language, and children can be brought up as monolinguals or bilinguals. Through investment into language policies, the status of the minority language can be increased. The aim of the intervention is to preserve the minority language in a bilingual subpopulation at low costs. We investigate the dynamic structure of the optimally controlled system as well as the optimal policy, identify stable equilibria and provide numerical case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Then, a seller and a buyer are randomly selected among the agents to bargain through a chain of intermediaries. We determine both the trading path and the allocation of the surplus among the seller, the buyer and the intermediaries at equilibrium. We show that, under the initiator bargaining protocol, a trading network is pairwise stable if it is a core-periphery network where the core consists of all impatient agents who are linked to each other and the periphery consists of all patient agents who have a single link towards an impatient agent. Once agents do not know the impatience of other agents, each bilateral bargaining session may involve delay. Then, core-periphery networks may not be pairwise stable because agents may prefer to add links for reducing the length of trading paths and so avoiding costly delays in reaching a global agreement.

Methods: The CC intervention's impact on health related quality of life, depression-free days (DFDs), and anxiety-free days (AFDs) over the 24-week postdischarge period was calculated and compared with the enhanced usual care (EUC) condition using independent samples t tests and random-effects regression models. Costs for both the CC and EUC conditions were calculated on the basis of staff time, overhead expenses, and treatment materials. Using this information, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. A cost-effectiveness acceptability plot was created using nonparametric bootstrapping with 10,000 replications, and the likelihood of the CC intervention's cost-effectiveness was assessed using standard cutoffs. As a secondary analysis, we determined whether the CC intervention led to reductions in postdischarge health care utilization and costs. Results: The CC intervention was more costly than the EUC intervention ($209.86 vs. $34.59; z = -11.71; P < 0.001), but was associated with significantly greater increases in quality adjusted life-years (t = -2.49; P = 0.01) and DFDs (t = -2.13; P = 0.03), but not AFDs (t = -1.92; P = 0.057). This translated into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3337.06 per quality adjusted life-year saved, $13.36 per DFD, and $13.74 per AFD. Compared with the EUC intervention, the CC intervention was also associated with fewer emergency department visits but no differences in overall costs. Conclusions: This CC intervention was associated with clinically relevant improvements, was cost-effective, and was associated with fewer emergency department visits in the 24 weeks after discharge.","[Celano, Christopher M.; Healy, Brian; Levy, Douglas E.; Januzzi, James L.; Huffman, Jeff C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Celano, Christopher M.; Suarez, Laura; Mastromauro, Carol; Huffman, Jeff C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Healy, Brian; Januzzi, James L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Biostat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Levy, Douglas E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mongan Inst Hlth Policy, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Celano, CM (通讯作者)，Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Blake 11,55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ccelano@partners.org,"Januzzi, James/Y-2436-2019; Levy, Douglas/W-1516-2019","Levy, Douglas/0000-0001-9446-7899; Celano, Christopher Michael/0000-0003-0547-2851",American Heart Association [10GRNT3450015],American Heart Association(American Heart Association),American Heart Association Grant-in-Aid (grant no. 10GRNT3450015 to J.C.

We implement the test for the period between 1984 and 2006 in the United States using microdata from the Census and other surveys linked to death records. Using our flexible test, we find that the evidence for a change in the SES-mortality gradient is not as strong as previous research has suggested. Our results indicate that the gradient increased for females during this time period, but we cannot rule out that the gradient among males has not changed. Informally, the results suggest that the changes for females are mainly driven by the bottom of the education distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Each agent desires relationships with the other side, but having multiple partners is costly. This cost-benefit tradeoff results in each agent having a single-peaked utility over the number of partners - the volume of trade - the peak being greater for agents on one side than those on the other. We propose a stochastic matching process in which self-interested agents form and sever links over time. Links can be added or deleted, sometimes simultaneously by a single agent. While the unperturbed process yields each pairwise stable network as an absorbing state, stochastic stability in two perturbed processes provides a significant refinement, leading respectively to egalitarian and anti-egalitarian pairwise stable networks. These distinct network configurations have implications for the concentration on each side of the market of a random information shock, which may also affect structurally identical economies differently. The analysis captures stylized facts, related to herd behavior, market fragmentation, concentration and contagion asymmetry, in several two-sided economies. It also rationalizes long-run population imbalance between the two sides of most buyer-seller markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike Stock and Yogo (2005), who considered a weak instruments problem where the rank of the matrix of reduced form parameters is near zero, here we consider a weak instruments problem of a near rank reduction of one in the matrix of reduced form parameters. For example, in a two-variable model, we consider weak instrument asymptotics of the form pi(1) = delta pi(2) + c/root n where pi(1) and pi(2) are the parameters in the two reduced-form equations, c is a vector of constants and n is the sample size. We investigate the use of a conditional first-stage F-statistic along the lines of the proposal by Angrist and Pischke (2009) and show that, unless delta = 0, the variance in the denominator of their F-statistic needs to be adjusted in order to get a correct asymptotic distribution when testing the hypothesis H-0 : pi(1) = delta pi(2). We show that a corrected conditional F-statistic is equivalent to the Cragg and Donald (1993) minimum eigenvalue rank test statistic, and is informative about the maximum total relative bias of the 2SLS estimator and the Wald tests size distortions. When delta = 0 in the two-variable model, or when there are more than two endogenous variables, further information over and above the Cragg-Donald statistic can be obtained about the nature of the weak instrument problem by computing the conditional first-stage F-statistics.

Fixed effects estimators are known to suffer from the incidental parameters problem, which can lead to large biases in estimates of common parameters. Pooled estimators, which ignore heterogeneity across individuals, are also generally inconsistent. We assume that individuals in the data are grouped on multiple levels where groups are defined by some observable external classification. We consider group effects estimators, where individual specific parameters are assumed common across groups at some level. We provide conditions under which group effects estimates of common parameters are asymptotically unbiased and normal.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fermentative behavior of oenological yeast in the presence of copper content in the must. The experiment used the following fungicides: Copper Sulfate, Copper Oxychloride and Copper Hydroxide. Samples were inoculated with S. cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae var. bayanus and Torulaspora delbrueckii and the fermentation was plotted for carbon dioxide production by time. The fermentative kinetics were assessed by the following kinetic parameters: the lag phase time, maximum rate of CO2 production and maximum production of CO2. The study showed that T. delbrueckii had higher sensitivity to copper regarding the lag phase. Copper oxychloride promoted greater latency period in yeast T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae. All copper fungicides decreased maximum rate of fermentation, and T. delbrueckii was the most affected. The maximum CO2 production during the fermentations significantly differed only in the presence of copper sulphate.","[Gava, Angelo; Ficagna, Evandro; Rossato, Simone B.; Cisilotto, Bruno; Miotto, Shana P.

In these regions, Chardonnay wine grape shows potential to produce quality wines, however, in commercial vineyards, the training system used has not provided productivities that makes economically viable the cultivation of this variety. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different cane-pruning systems on the vegetative, productive and enological potential of Chardonnay grapevines grown in the high-altitude region of Southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a commercial Chardonnay vineyard, located in Sao Joaquim - Santa Catarina State (28 degrees 17 '39S and 49 degrees. 55' 56 W, to 1230m a.s.l) during 2015 and 2016 vintages. Chardonnay vines (grafted on 1103 Paulsen) were planted in 2010, with a 3.0m (row) x1.0m (vine) spacing. The treatments consisted of different cane-pruning systems: Cordon spur-pruning (control); Sylvoz; Cazenave; Capovolto; single Guyot and double Guyot. Pruning was performed in August of each year when the buds were in the green tip developmental stage. Data was analyzed by Scott Knott test (p < 0.05) following a randomized block design with four replicates, each consisting of 12 vines per plot. We observed higher yield in the Cazenave and double Guyot training system with three and two more tons of grapes than spur-pruning respectively. The bud fertility was higher in plants trained in double Guyot. Vines spur-pruned showed higher relation of leaf area: production, with values above 100 cm(2) g(-1) grape at 2016 vintage. Commercial maturity of grapes (soluble solids, acidity and polyphenols) did not differ among training systems studied. The results suggest that cane-pruning systems could be an alternative to increase production efficiency of Chardonnay in high-altitude region of southern Brazil.","[Marcon Filho, Jose Luiz; Allebrandt, Ricardo; Wurz, Douglas Andre; de Bem, Betina Pereira; de Macedo, Tiago Afonso; Kretzschmar, Aike Anneliese; Rufato, Leo] Santa Catarina State Univ UDESC, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Av Luiz de Camoes 2090, BR-88520000 Lages, SC, Brazil",Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina,"Marcon, JL (通讯作者)，Santa Catarina State Univ UDESC, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Av Luiz de Camoes 2090, BR-88520000 Lages, SC, Brazil.",marconfilho_jl@yahoo.com.br,"Rufato, Leo/GLV-2143-2022; Allebrandt, Ricardo/B-5873-2017","Rufato, Leo/0000-0001-9545-7035; Allebrandt, Ricardo/0000-0001-8222-6254",,,,,17,3,3,0,9,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1036.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701036,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700036,0

In order to avoid the problem for forecasting, the paper proposes a new factor multivariate stochastic volatility (fMSV) model for realized covariance measures that accommodates asymmetry and long memory. Using the basic structure of the fMSV model, the paper extends the dynamic correlation fMSV model, the conditional/stochastic Wishart autoregressive models, the matrix-exponential MSV model, and the Cholesky MSV model. Empirical results for 7 financial asset returns for the US stock returns indicate that the new fMSV models outperform existing dynamic conditional correlation models for forecasting future covariances. Regarding the forecasting performance for one-day, five-day and ten-day horizons, the recommended specification among the new fMSV models is the stochastic Wishart autoregressive specification with asymmetric effects for the periods during and after the global financial crisis, while the Cholesky fMSV model with long memory and asymmetry displays the best performance for periods without the financial turbulence.

ART dramatically prolongs life and reduces infectiousness for people with HIV. This paper shows that ART availability increases work time for HIV-negative people without caretaker obligations, who do not directly benefit from the medicine. A difference-in-difference design compares people living near and far from ART, before and after treatment becomes available. Next we explore the possible reasons for this pattern. Although we cannot pinpoint the mechanism, we find that ART availability substantially reduces subjective mortality risk and improves mental health. These results show an undocumented economic consequence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and an important externality of medical innovation.

How does the restriction to supply only one market influence the existence of equilibria in the game? To answer this question, we study a general class of aggregative location games where a strategy of a player is to choose simultaneously both a location out of a finite set and a non-negative quantity out of a compact interval. The utility of each player is assumed to depend solely on the chosen location, the chosen quantity, and the aggregated quantity of all other players on the chosen location.

We examine the effect of vision insurance on eye care utilization and vision health outcomes by taking advantage of quasi-experimental variation in Medicaid coverage of adult vision care. Using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach, we find that Medicaid beneficiaries with vision coverage are 4.4 percentage points (p <0.01) more likely to have seen an eye doctor in the past year, 5.3 percentage points (p <0.01) less likely to report needing but not purchasing eyeglasses or contacts due to cost, 2.0 percentage points (p <0.05) less likely to report difficulty seeing with usual vision correction, and 1.2 percentage points (p <0.01) less likely to have a functional limitation due to vision.

In this study, we examine how presumed consent impacts cadaveric donations and kidney transplantations, using a panel dataset from the EU-27 countries plus Croatia in the period 2000-2010. We find that presumed consent countries have 28% to 32% higher cadaveric donation and 27% to 31% higher kidney transplant rates in comparison to informed consent countries, after accounting for potential confounding factors. After studying willingness to donate one's organs and registering preferences for organ donation, we find that presumed consent could increase cadaveric donation rates, because people fail to register their preferences and many have no preference for organ donation.

We then focus our attention on the Average (rooted)-Tree solution (see Herings et al. (2008)). We provide a basis for its kernel and a new axiomatic characterization by using the classical axiom for inessential games, and two new axioms of invariance called Invariance with respect to irrelevant coalitions and Weighted addition invariance on bi-partitions.

In particular, we allow for utility curvature, equity weighting, sign-dependence, and loss aversion in choices concerning quality of life of other people. We find substantial inequity aversion, both for gains and losses, which can be attributed to both diminishing marginal utility and differential weighting of better-off and worse-off. There are also clear framing effects, which violate expected utility. Moreover, we observe loss aversion, indicating that subjects give more weight to one group's loss than another group's gain of the same absolute magnitude. We also elicited some information on the effect of the age of the studied group. The amount of inequity aversion is to some extent influenced by the age of the considered patients. In particular, more inequity aversion is observed for gains of older people than gains of younger people. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Attema, Arthur E.; Brouwer, Werner B.

In most of the studies on attribute non-attendance, it is assumed that respondents consciously (or unconsciously) ignore one or more attributes of the alternatives, regardless of their levels. In this paper, we present a new line of enquiry and approach for modelling non-attendance in the context of investigating preferences for health service innovations. This approach recognises that non-attendance may not just be associated with attributes but may also apply to the attribute's levels. Our results show that respondents process each level of an attribute differently: while attending to the attribute, they ignore a subset of the attribute's levels. In such cases, the usual approach of assuming that respondents either attend to the attribute or not, irrespective of its levels, is erroneous and could lead to misguided policy recommendations. Our results indicate that allowing for attribute-level non-attendance leads to substantial improvements in the model fit and has an impact on estimated marginal willingness to pay and choice predictions.Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Erdem, Seda; Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Hole, Arne Risa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Stirling; University of Sheffield,"Erdem, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",seda.erdem@stir.ac.uk,"Hole, Arne Risa/JNE-2362-2023; Erdem, Seda/B-7225-2014; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Erdem, Seda/0000-0002-4296-5834; Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Leeds York Bradford Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Leeds York Bradford Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care,"This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the Leeds York Bradford Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care.

First, I consider the benchmark case in which agents have identical preferences, and I then extend the framework to allow for heterogeneous tastes. In both cases, I identify an appropriate egalitarian benchmark which requires that a numeraire commodity be distributed in such a way so as to offset differences in the holdings of other commodities. Inequality is then measured as the deviation between the actual distribution of the numeraire and such an ideal distribution. This renders a complete social ordering. Next, I contrast this notion of equal shadow wealth with the notion of no-envy (Foley, 1967) and with the envy-intensity measures proposed by Chaudhuri (1986) and Diamantaras and Thomson (1990). I also investigate conditions which ensure the existence of equitable and efficient allocations. The concepts developed here may be generalizable to a wide range of environments including economies with externalities and indivisible goods as well as relatively unstructured environments such as those involving abstract opportunity sets. In addition, this approach offers a simple method to measure multidimensional inequality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To develop a US-level model to estimate the effect of tumor misclassification on health care costs and patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Methods: Decision analysis was used to estimate the number of patients with early-stage breast cancer (EBC) whose HER2 status was misclassified in 2012. PP results were assumed to generate unnecessary trastuzumab costs and unnecessary cases of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. FN results were assumed to save money on trastuzumab, but with a loss of QALYs and greater risk of disease recurrence and its associated costs. QALYs were valued at $100,000 under a net monetary benefit approach. Results: Among 226,870 women diagnosed with EBC in 2012, 3.12% (n = 7,070) and 2.18% (n = 4,955) were estimated to have had FP and FN test results, respectively. Approximately 8400 QALYs (discounted, lifetime) were lost among women not receiving trastuzumab because of FN results. The estimated incremental per patient lifetime burden of FP or FN results was $58,900 and $116,000, respectively. The implied incremental losses to society were $417 million and $575 million, respectively. Conclusions: HER2 tests result in misclassification and nonoptimal treatment of approximately 12,025 US patients with EBC annually. The total economic societal loss of nearly $1 billion suggests that improvements in HER2 testing accuracy are needed and that further clinical and economic studies are warranted.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Babigumira, Joseph B.] VeriTech Corp, Mercer Island, WA USA; [Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Babigumira, Joseph B.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Masaquel, Anthony; Lalla, Deepa; Brammer, Melissa] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Wang, Bruce C.

So far, explanations have been based on labor force composition and reduced moral hazard caused by fear of job loss during recessions. In this paper, we propose and test a third mechanism caused by reduced moral hazard during booms and infections. We suggest that the workload is higher during economic booms and thus employees have to go to work despite being sick. In a theoretical model focusing on infectious diseases, we show that this will provoke infections of coworkers leading to overall higher sickness absence during economic upturns. Using state-level aggregated data from 112 German public health insurance funds (out of 145 in total), we find that sickness absence due to infectious diseases shows the largest procyclical pattern, as predicted by our theoretical model.

We examine potential mechanisms underlying these effects by incorporating findings from the genetics and neuroscience literatures. We use a sample of siblings combined with an orchids and dandelions hypothesis, where the IQ of genetic dandelions is not affected by in utero nutrition variation but genetic orchids thrive under advantageous conditions and wilt in poor conditions. Indeed, using variation in three candidate genes related to neuroplasticity (APOE, BDNF, and COMT), we find substantial heterogeneity in the associations between birth weight and adult outcomes, where part of the population (i.e., dandelions) is not affected by birth weight variation. Our results help uncover why birth weight affects adult outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Cook, C.

We show that the averaging estimators with fixed weights are asymptotically normal and then develop a plug-in averaging estimator that minimizes the sample analog of the asymptotic mean squared error. We investigate the focused information criterion (Claeskens and Hjort, 2003), the plug-in averaging estimator, the Mallows model averaging estimator (Hansen, 2007), and the jackknife model averaging estimator (Hansen and Racine, 2012). We find that the asymptotic distributions of averaging estimators with data-dependent weights are nonstandard and cannot be approximated by simulation. To address this issue, we propose a simple procedure to construct valid confidence intervals with improved coverage probability. Monte Carlo simulations show that the plug-in averaging estimator generally has smaller expected squared error than other existing model averaging methods, and the coverage probability of proposed confidence intervals achieves the nominal level. As an empirical illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to cross-country growth regressions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, UPF increases intervention uptake and hence the extent of consequent health gains. Second, UPF generates financial consequences including the crowding out of private expenditures. Finally, UPF provides insurance either by covering catastrophic expenditures, which would otherwise throw households into poverty or by preventing diseases that cause them. This paper develops a methodextended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA)for evaluating the consequences of UPF in each of these domains. It then illustrates ECEA with an evaluation of UPF for tuberculosis treatment in India. Using plausible values for key parameters, our base case ECEA concludes that the health gains and insurance value of UPF would accrue primarily to the poor. Reductions in out-of-pocket expenditures are more uniformly distributed across income quintiles. A variant on our base case suggests that lowering costs of borrowing for the poor could potentially achieve some of the health gains of UPF, but at the cost of leaving the poor more deeply in debt.

Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the direct cost of UP to the healthcare system in Russia and the proportion attributable to using unreliable contraception. Methods A cost model was built, adopting a generic payer perspective with a 1-year time horizon. The analysis cohort was defined as women of childbearing age between 18 and 44 years actively seeking to avoid pregnancy. Model inputs were derived from published sources or government statistics with a 2012 cost base. To estimate the number of UPs attributable to unreliable methods, the model combined annual typical use failure rates and age-adjusted utilization for each contraceptive method. Published survey data was used to adjust the total cost of UP by the number of UPs that were mistimed rather than unwanted. Scenario analysis considered alternate allocation of methods to the reliable and unreliable categories and estimate of the burden of UP in the target sub-group of women aged 18-29 years. Results The model estimated 1,646,799 UPs in the analysis cohort (women aged 18-44 years) with an associated annual cost of US$783 million. The model estimated 1,019,371 UPs in the target group of 18-29 years, of which 88 % were attributable to unreliable contraception. The total cost of UPs in the target group was estimated at approximately US$ 498 million, of which US$ 441 million could be considered attributable to the use of unreliable methods. Conclusion The cost of UP attributable to use of unreliable contraception in Russia is substantial. Policies encouraging use of reliable contraceptive methods could reduce the burden of UP.","[Lowin, Julia; Jarrett, James; Dimova, Maria] IMS Hlth, London N1 9JY, England; [Ignateva, Victoria; Omelyanovsky, Vitaly] Russian Natl Res Med Univ, Res Ctr Clin & Econ Evaluat & Pharmacoecon, Moscow, Russia; [Filonenko, Anna] Bayer Pharma AG, D-13553 Berlin, Germany",Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Filonenko, A (通讯作者)，Bayer Pharma AG, D-13553 Berlin, Germany.",anna.filonenko@bayer.com,"Omelyanovskiy, Vitaly V/P-6911-2018; Ignatyeva, Victoria/P-8169-2014","Omelyanovskiy, Vitaly V/0000-0003-1581-0703; Ignatyeva, Victoria/0000-0001-6789-9514; Filonenko, Anna/0000-0003-4553-0534",,,,,26,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objective This study examined Medicaid-insured HIV-positive and AIDS-diagnosed patient groups to determine the association of ART adherence to mean monthly total healthcare expenditures in the 24-month measurement period, controlling for demographic, geographic, insurance, and clinical factors. The present study extends the existing literature by analyzing the relationship of ART adherence to total healthcare costs for asymptomatic HIV-positive patients separately from those patients with AIDS-defining conditions. Methods This retrospective study utilized claims data from Florida Medicaid claims from July 2006 through June 2011. All patients (n = 502) were HIV-positive, aged 18-64 years, non-pregnant, and ART naive for at least 12 months prior to the measurement period. Each patient was categorized, based on medication possession ratios, as adherent (>= 90 %) or non-adherent (<90 %), and were divided into two groups: HIV positive (n = 232) and AIDS diagnosed (n = 270). Generalized linear models predicted the mean monthly total expenditures for the non-adherence group versus the adherence group. Results For the HIV-positive group, the adjusted mean monthly expenditures for the non-adherent group were US$1,291; the adherent group adjusted mean monthly expenditures were US$1,926. The HIV-positive non-adherent group adjusted mean monthly expenditures were significantly less than the adherent group (-40 %, p < 0.001). However, for the AIDS-diagnosed group, there was not a statistically significant association of ART adherence to total healthcare expenditures (p = 0.29). Conclusion The results show that the relationship of ART adherence to healthcare costs is more complex than previously reported.","[Pruitt, Zachary; Langland-Orban, Barbara; Brooks, Robert G.] Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth Hlth Policy & Management, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Robst, John] Univ S Florida, Florida Mental Hlth Inst, Tampa, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Pruitt, Z (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth Hlth Policy & Management, 13201 Bruce B Downs Blvd,MDC 56, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",zpruitt1@health.usf.edu,,"Robst, John/0000-0003-1965-0233",,,,,30,5,6,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In this partially identified model, we propose a new estimator based on MT's modified maximum score (MMS) method by introducing density weights to the objective function, which allows us to develop asymptotic properties of the proposed set estimator for inference. We show that the density-weighted MMS estimator converges at a nearly cube-root-n rate. We propose an asymptotically valid inference procedure for the identified region based on subsampling.

The commodity space is assumed to be an ordered Banach space which has possibly the empty positive cone. The lack of interior points is compensated by an additional assumption of a cone of arbitrage that allows us to use Lyapunov's convexity theorem in its weak form. The measure space of agents involves both negligible and non negligible traders. The extension is proved in the general class of Aubin coalitions for which a suitable version of Grodal's result (Grodal (1972)) is also formulated.

The tests impose no restrictions on the functional form of the drift function and are shown to be asymptotically distribution-free. The tests are consistent against a large class affixed alternatives and have nontrivial power against a class of root-n local alternatives. The paper also extends the tests of volatility to testing for joint specifications of drift and volatility. Monte Carlo simulations show that the tests perform well in finite samples. The proposed tests are then applied to testing models of short-term interest, using data of Treasury bill rate and Eurodollar deposit rate. The empirical results show that the commonly used CKLS volatility function of Chan et al. (1992) fits volatility function poorly and none of the parametric interest rate models considered in the paper fit data well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Xperience the CITY, is a project aiming to change the way we travel so far, by changing the existing tourism supply chain and taking the City of Destination from a passive to a more active role, acting as an integrator among demand and supply. At the same time it calls for co-creation and invites travelers to co-create travel experiences. Building upon the premises of service-dominant logic that the customer is a co-creator of value and the essence of the experience economy, this project attempts to explore innovative ways where traveling is approached holistically as an end-to-end service. Following an extensive review of literature and an Explorative Research (qualitative), a preliminary model along with a proposed service is developed. In order for this model to be tested and validated, a Validation Research (quantitative) was designed addressing all major stakeholders. By this research the authors obtained valuable insights from 514 Passengers, 42 Hotels, 6 Airlines and 6 Airports, regarding current practices and an almost catholic validation of the preliminary model. Not only passengers are deeply interested in thematic traveling and are ready to co-create with the industry and benefit from such strategies, but Airlines and Airports would be ready to fully incorporate such service into their practices.","[Dougali, Evangelia G.; Santema, Sicco C.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Santema, Sicco C.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Prod Innovat Management, Delft, Netherlands; [van Blokland, W.

A lot of financial institutions don't care about microfinance in the rural area. They extract capital of farmers and turn them into the cities.

A duopolistic game is constructed in which firms choose their locations simultaneously in the first stage, and decide the prices of the product and wages of labor in the second stage. We find that the equilibrium locations depend on the production technology. Specifically, when productivity increases, the two firms change from dispersion to agglomeration and then to dispersion again. We then analyze the case with a minimum wage requirement and show the robustness of the equilibrium locations. Furthermore, the socially optimal locations do not depend on the production technology and the minimum wage requirement. However, a higher minimum wage increases unemployment and prices, which may reduce the total welfare level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The implication might be that it is not enough for an organization to merely flatter their employees to raise their engagement levels.","[Liao Yong-zhong] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China; [Chen Xiao-chun] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Humanities & Law, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Technology; Hebei University of Technology,"Liao, YZ (通讯作者)，Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Yihao/JGM-3514-2023",,,,,,33,0,0,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1166,1171,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600156,0

Our survey of 5000+ male smokers was conducted two years after their neighbor's lung cancer diagnosis. We use proximity to a lung cancer neighbor as an exogenous determinant of individual's smoking risk perception. We show that learning of a neighbor's lung cancer diagnosis substantially affects smokers' subjective beliefs about smoking's harms, which in turn affects decisions about continued smoking and intentions to quit. Our study findings offer important public policy implications in indicating the importance of designing health-warning messages that fit smokers' personal circumstances as opposed to warnings solely based on edicts from scientific experts and/or epidemiological evidence.

Objective: To develop and demonstrate the use of evidence synthesis methods to evaluate extensive treatment networks with a limited number of trials, making use of classes. Methods: Using Bayesian Markoy chain Monte Carlo methods, we build on the existing work of a random effects NMA to develop a three-level hierarchical NMA model that accounts for the exchangeability between treatments within the same class as well as for the residual between study heterogeneity. We demonstrate the application of these methods to a continuous and binary outcome, using a motivating example of overactive bladder. We illustrate methods for incorporating ordering constraints in increasing doses, model selection, and assessing inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence. Results: The methods were applied to a data set obtained from a systematic literature review of trials for overactive bladder, evaluating the mean reduction in incontinence episodes from baseline and the number of patients reporting one or more adverse events. The data set involved 72 trials comparing 34 interventions that were categorized into nine classes of interventions, including placebo. Conclusions: Bayesian three level hierarchical NMAs have the potential to increase the precision in the effect estimates while maintaining the interpretability of the individual interventions for decision making.

Though museums are part of the education and leisure industry, the distinction between education and leisure is often blurred. There are a number of reasons why people visit museums. Motives of museum visitors can be grouped into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This study analysed the extent to which museum visitors are motivated by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Semi-structured interviews with visitors were conducted w at the Imperial Museum of War (North and South), United Kingdom. The findings do establish that extrinsic motivations are more dominant than the intrinsic ones for visiting the Imperial War Museum. The importance of extrinsic factors in motivating museum visitors would suggest that providing an opportunity for a good day out has more appeal to the visitors than the collections in the museum for the average visitors. The experiencing of museum in its totality is more important than the individual collections or the theme of the museum to the mainstream visitor. This work has made a contribution to understanding visitor motivations, which are multi-facetted, complex and not necessarily fully understood by the visitors themselves.","[Powell, Raymond; Kokkranikal, Jithendran] Univ Greenwich, Dept Mkt Events & Tourism, London SE10 9LS, England",University of Greenwich,"Kokkranikal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Dept Mkt Events & Tourism, London SE10 9LS, England.",R.Powell@gre.ac.uk; J.Kokkranikal@gre.ac.uk,"Kokkranikal, Jithendran/P-7452-2018","Kokkranikal, Jithendran/0000-0003-0103-562X",,,,,46,6,6,7,28,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,169,181,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_15,0.0,,,13,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000014,0

Product innovation activities of a firm directly determine how well its product matches the target consumers' preferences and in turn significantly affects a country's trade growth path. Therefore, we attempt to explain the driving factors of trade growth by studying the effects of product innovation strength on trade margin. This paper sheds light on how product innovation affects the dual margins of export growth. The research results have shown that product innovation promotes the expansion of extensive margin (Proposition 1) and product innovation negatively affects intensive margin when the overall level of product innovation in a certain country (or industry) is very low (Proposition 2). Using micro-level data from Chinese manufacturing firms, our empirical results are in line with the theoretical hypothesis. In other words, product innovation significantly promotes the extensive margin of China's export while the impact of product innovation on the intensive margin is negative. Furthermore, the effects of product innovation on export margins are significantly different among various industries with differentiated characteristics. Relevant policy recommendations are obvious. In order to maintain the sustainability of trade growth, a country should balance the internal and external equilibrium of development path and take a variety of measures to actively guide firms to enhance product innovation strength. To achieve a healthy and balanced trade development the government should encourage more firms to enter into the international market.","[Wu Fei-fei] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Wu, FF (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,958,967,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600127,0

In each treatment, pupils received a sticker for choosing a fruit or vegetable at lunch. They were eligible for an additional reward at the end of the week depending on the number of stickers accumulated, either individually (individual scheme) or in comparison to others (competition). Overall, we find no significant effect of the individual scheme, but positive effects of competition. For children who had margin to increase their consumption, competition increases choice of fruit and vegetables by 33% and consumption by 48%. These positive effects generally carry over to the week immediately following the treatment, but are not sustained effects six months later. We also find large differences in effectiveness across demographic characteristics such as age and gender. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It creates a misperceived utility loss and increases health care costs. Conversely, a healthy good provides misperceived utility gains and reduces health care costs. Individuals differ in income and in their degree of misperception; they vote over a fat tax according to their misperceived utility. A fraction of the tax proceeds is earmarked to reduce health insurance premiums; the remainder finances a subsidy on the healthy good. This earmarking rule is determined to maximize welfare, anticipating the induced political equilibrium. The equilibrium fat tax is always lower than the utilitarian level. This is not necessarily true with a Rawlsian objective. The determination of the earmarking rule is complex. Even in the utilitarian case, it is not just used to boost political support for the fat tax. Instead, it may involve a tradeoff between fat tax and healthy good subsidy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that star rating increases the price differential between top- and bottom-ranked facilities. On average, prices of top-ranked facilities increased by 4.8 to 6.0 percent more than the prices of bottom-ranked facilities. We find stronger price effects in markets that are less concentrated where consumers may have more choices of alternative nursing homes.

The synthetic control method aims to estimate treatment effects by constructing a weighted combination of control units, which represents what the treated group would have experienced in the absence of receiving the treatment. While DiD estimation assumes that the effects of unobserved confounders are constant over time, the synthetic control method allows for these effects to change over time, by re-weighting the control group so that it has similar pre-intervention characteristics to the treated group. We extend the synthetic control approach to a setting of evaluation of a health policy where there are multiple treated units. We re-analyse a recent study evaluating the effects of a hospital P4P scheme on risk-adjusted hospital mortality. In contrast to the original DiD analysis, the synthetic control method reports that, for the incentivised conditions, the P4P scheme did not significantly reduce mortality and that there is a statistically significant increase in mortality for non-incentivised conditions. This result was robust to alternative specifications of the synthetic control method. (c) 2015 The Authors.

A review of psychological and nutrition studies highlights the complexity of processes at work on each stage of this causal chain. Econometric analyses trace the effects along the hypothesized pathway using detailed household panel data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey from 1994 to 2005. Economic insecurity measures serve as key explanatory variables in regressions and are instrumented by exogenous regional indicators. Results support a causal chain from economic insecurity to weight outcomes for some population subgroups. In contrast to the leading hypothesis that economic insecurity increases body weight, I find strong evidence of a decreasing effect among women. Results suggest further that consumption of foods rich in sugar responds strongly to higher levels of economic insecurity. Heterogeneous impacts of economic insecurity on body weight call for individual-level interventions rather than large-scale action. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Asymptotic independence and asymptotic dependence behave drastically different in modeling such co-movements, For example, the impact of extreme events is usually overestimated whenever asymptotic dependence is wrongly assumed. On the other hand, the impact is seriously underestimated whenever the data is misspecified as asymptotic independent. Therefore, distinguishing between asymptotic independence/dependence scenarios is very informative for any decision-making and especially in risk management, We investigate the properties of the limiting conditional Kendall's tau which can be used to detect the presence of asymptotic independence/dependence. We also propose nonparametric estimation for this new measure and derive its asymptotic limit. A simulation study shows good performances of the new measure and its combination with the coefficient of tail dependence proposed by Ledford and Tawn (1996, 1997). Finally, applications to financial and insurance data are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Coinsurance and Dental-Care Utilization in Colombia,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VISIT COPAYMENTS; ORAL-HEALTH; INSURANCE; DEMAND; SERVICES; COVERAGE; MODELS,"Background Copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance, are elements of health-care systems to make prices salient for the insured. Individuals may respond differently to cost sharing, according to the type of care they seek; dental care, as a combination of both acute and elective care, is an ideal setting to study the effects of cost-sharing-mechanisms on utilization. Objective To test how coinsurance affects dental-care utilization in a middle-income country context. Methods This study uses policy variations in the Colombian health-care system to analyze changes in dental-care utilization due to different levels of coinsurance. We used matching procedures to balance observed differences in pre-treatment variables between those who face coinsurance (non-policy holders, or beneficiaries) and those who don't (policyholders). We use zero-inflated negative binomial models for the count of visits and two-part models for total expenditures, and test for unobservable confounders with random-effect models and instrumental variables. Results Individuals who face coinsurance are less likely to have any dental-care utilization, at a relatively small scale. Facing coinsurance does not correlate with changes in total expenditures. Falsification tests with dental-care visits exempt from coinsurance show no statistically distinguishable changes in utilization. Random-effect models and instrumental variable models show results similar to the main specification. Conclusions Cost-sharing policies in Colombia seem to be well designed because they don't represent an important barrier to dental-care access.","[Higuera, Lucas] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ivan Prada, Sergio] Univ ICESI & PROESA, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Adm & Econ, Calle 18 122-135, Cali 760031, Colombia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universidad ICESI,"Higuera, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",higue003@umn.edu,"Prada, Sergio I./ABC-4648-2020","Prada, Sergio I./0000-0001-7986-0959",,,,,39,2,3,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Second, we explain how mechanized reasoning has been applied to economic problems, concentrating on the two domains that have attracted the most attention: social choice theory and auction theory. Finally, we present a detailed example of mechanized reasoning in practice by means of a proof of Vickrey's familiar theorem on second-price auctions. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Each seller produces multiple units of several types of commodities. We make the quasi-linearity assumption on the sellers, but not on the buyers.

Furthermore, technology is often considered exogenous. Using 1996-2007 panel data on Swiss geographical areas, we assessed the impact of technology availability on per capita healthcare spending covered by basic health insurance whilst controlling for the endogeneity of health technology availability variables. Our results suggest that medical research, patent intensity and the density of employees working in the medical device industry are influential factors for the adoption of technology and can be used as instruments for technology availability variables in the cost equation. These results are similar to previous findings: CT and PET scanner adoption is associated with increased healthcare spending, whilst increased availability of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty facilities is associated with reductions in per capita spending. However, our results suggest that the magnitude of these relationships is much greater in absolute value than that suggested by previous studies that did not control for the possible endogeneity of the availability of technologies.

To test for the functional white noise null hypothesis, we propose a Cramer-von Mises type test based on the functional periodogram introduced by Panaretos and Tavakoli (2013a). Using the Hilbert space approach, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under suitable assumptions. A new block bootstrap procedure is introduced to obtain the critical values from the non pivotal limiting distribution. Compared to existing methods, our approach is robust to the dependence within white noise and it does not involve the choices of functional principal components and lag truncation number. We employ the proposed method to check the adequacy of functional linear models and functional autoregressive models of order one by testing the uncorrelatedness of the residuals. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the empirical advantages of the proposed method over existing alternatives. Our method is illustrated via an application to cumulative intradaily returns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost utility of ICS + LABA treatment compared with ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma. Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with ICS + LABA treatment versus ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma in the United States from the health system perspective. The HCUPnet 2010 national statistics were used to extract the costs associated with asthma and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and inpatient mortality associated with these events. Event probabilities were predicted using Medicare 2009-2010 claims for older adults with asthma. Treatment costs were estimated on the basis of average wholesale drug price listings, and utility estimates were extracted from the literature. To account for uncertainty, oneway sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. Results: The model predicted that, compared with ICS + LTRA treatment, ICS + LABA treatment costs $5,823 more while gaining 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $209,090 per QALY. Hospitalization probabilities and posthospitalization utilities were the most influential parameters in the one-way sensitivity analysis. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the probabilities that ICS + LTRA treatment is cost-effective compared with ICS + LABA treatment are 77% and 62% at $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained willingness-to-pay thresholds, respectively. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of ICS + LABA treatment is economically unfavorable in older adults when compared with LTRA as addon treatment.","[Altawalbeh, Shoroq M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Ctr Clin Pharmaceut Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Altawalbeh, Shoroq M.] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Pharm, Dept Clin Pharm, Irbid, Jordan; [Thorpe, Joshua M.; Thorpe, Carolyn T.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm & Therapeut, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Thorpe, Joshua M.; Thorpe, Carolyn T.] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Med, Sect Decis Sci & Clin Syst Modeling, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Jordan University of Science & Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Altawalbeh, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 200 Meyran Ave,Suite 200, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",sha55@pitt.edu,,"Altawalbeh, Shoroq/0000-0001-8345-4048; Smith, Kenneth J/0000-0001-8088-566X",University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy; Pittsburgh Claude D.

In this paper, we study two non-price methods that are often used to alleviate shortage for human blood. The first method is informing existing donors of a current shortage via a mobile message and encouraging them to donate voluntarily. The second method is asking the patient's family or friends to donate in a family replacement (FR) program at the time of shortage. Using 447,357 individual donation records across 8 years from a large Chinese blood bank, we show that both methods are effective in addressing blood shortage in the short run but have different implications for total blood supply in the long run. We compare the efficacy of these methods and discuss their applications under different scenarios to alleviate shortage.

Social marketing organisations apply private sector marketing approaches to sell public health products. This paper investigates the impact of marketing tools, including promotion and pricing, on demand for male and female condoms in 52 countries between 1997 and 2009. A static model differentiates drivers of demand between products, while a dynamic panel data estimator estimates their short- and long-run impacts. Products are not equally affected: female condoms are not affected by advertising, but highly affected by interpersonal communication and HIV prevalence. Price and promotion have significant short- and long-run effects, with female condoms far more sensitive to price than male condoms. The design of optimal distribution strategies for new and existing HIV prevention technologies must consider both product and target population characteristics. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J,"Yu, PP",,,,"Yu, Peter P.",,,Challenges in Measuring Cost and Value in Oncology: Making It Personal,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,clinical practice guidelines; cost-effectiveness analysis,AMERICAN SOCIETY,"Oncology patients often find themselves facing an incurable disease with limited treatment options and increasing patient fragility. The importance of patient preferences and values increases in shared decision making especially when the cost of cancer care is continuing its steep rise. As our understanding of cancer systems biology increases, we are justifiably optimistic about therapeutic improvements but recognize that this has complicated the traditional Food and Drug Administration approval of drug indications based on organ specific cancer for a particular drug. Dynamic and agile clinical guidelines that reflect a rapidly changing knowledge base for decision making support are needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has been working on three initiatives to tackle these complex issues. The first initiative is ASCO's collaboration with other international organizations to create a framework to assess drugs for the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List, including non generics. The second initiative aims to define clinically meaningful outcomes as precision medicine expands the definition of cancers, leading to increased demand for the use of targeted drugs as single agents or in combination. The third initiative is ASCO's value framework, published in 2015, focusing on patient-physician shared decision making. The framework incorporates three parameters: 1) the meaningfulness of the clinical benefit, 2) the toxicity of the treatment, and 3) the patient's financial out-of-pocket cost. ASCO is concerned about the rising cost of cancer care when the clinical complexity and the pace of change in oncology are accelerating, and it is committed to help improve patient outcomes and value in cancer care as well as to engage the broader health care community in a process of collaborative improvement.","[Yu, Peter P.] Hartford HealthCare Canc Inst, Hartford, CT USA",,"Yu, PP (通讯作者)，Hartford HealthCare, 1 State St, Hartford, CT 06103 USA.",peter.yu@asco.org,,,,,,,6,12,14,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,520,524,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.017,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565267.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600004,0

Identification is secured through instrumental variables and/or conditional independence (matching) assumptions. We decompose treatment effects into direct effects and continuation values associated with moving to the next stage of a decision problem. Using our framework, we decompose the IV estimator, showing that IV generally does not estimate economically interpretable or policy-relevant parameters in prototypical dynamic discrete choice models, unless policy variables are instruments. Continuation values are an empirically important component of estimated total treatment effects of education. We use our analysis to estimate the components of what LATE estimates in a dynamic discrete choice model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This exposes patients to an infection risk. Tegaderm chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) (developed by 3M)a transparent securement dressing-covers and protects catheter sites and secures devices to the skin. It comprises a transparent adhesive dressing to act as a barrier against external contamination and an integrated gel pad containing an antiseptic agent. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee (MTAC) at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected Tegaderm CHG for evaluation. One study was identified by the sponsor as relevant to the decision problem. From this, the sponsor concluded that compared with standard dressings, Tegaderm CHG is associated with lower rates of catheter-related infection, but increased dermatitis incidence. The External Assessment Centre (EAC) identified four paired comparative studies between Tegaderm CHG, other CHG dressings or standard dressings. The EAC agreed with the sponsor's conclusion, finding that CHG dressings reduce infections compared with standard dressings. The sponsor constructed a de novo costing model. Tegaderm CHG generated cost savings of 77.26 pound per patient compared with standard dressings and was cost saving in 98.5 % of a sample of sets of inputs (2013 prices). The EAC critiqued and updated the model's inputs, yielding similar results to those the sponsor estimate. The MTAC reviewed the evidence and decided to support the case for adoption, issuing a positive draft recommendation. After a public consultation, NICE published this as Medical Technology Guidance 25.","[Jenks, Michelle; Craig, Joyce; Green, William; Arber, Mick] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Hewitt, Neil] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Level 1A,City Tower,Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BT, Lancs, England; [Sims, Andrew] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Freeman Hosp, Freeman Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7DN, Tyne & Wear, England",University of York - UK; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Newcastle Freeman Hospital,"Jenks, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",michelle.jenks@york.ac.uk,"Sims, Andrew/AAT-8027-2021; Green, William/HGB-7114-2022","Sims, Andrew/0000-0002-9553-7278; Jenks, Michelle/0000-0002-1637-1506",NICE,NICE,"The authors are grateful to the clinical experts identified by NICE, who provided expertise and clinical knowledge.

We consider here some such quantum-like models that address question order effects, i.e. cases in which given answers depend on the order of presentation of the questions. Models of various dimensionalities could be used; can the simplest ones be empirically adequate? From the quantum law of reciprocity, we derive new empirical predictions that we call the Grand Reciprocity equations, that must be satisfied by several existing quantum-like models, in their non-degenerate versions. Using substantial existing data sets, we show that these non-degenerate versions fail the GR test in most cases, which means that, if quantum-like models of the kind considered here are to work, it can only be in their degenerate versions. However, we suggest that the route of degenerate models is not necessarily an easy one, and we argue for more research on the empirical adequacy of degenerate quantum-like models in general.

We extend Schennach (2007) to identify moments of the conditional distribution of a true Y given a true X when both are measured with error, the measurement errors in Y and X are correlated, and the true unknown model of Y given X has nonseparable model errors. After showing nonparametric identification, we provide a sieve generalized method of moments based estimator of the model, and apply it to nonparametric Engel curve estimation. In our application measurement errors on the expenditures of a good Y are by construction correlated with measurement errors in total expenditures X. This problem, which is present in many consumption data sets, has been ignored in most demand applications.

However, this comparison is inadequate when clinical practice differs from guidelines, or when clinical practice differs between hospitals. We examined the degree of variation in the way patients with a recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke are assessed and used the results to illustrate the importance of investigating possible clinical practice variation, and the need to perform hospital-level cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) when variation exists. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 vascular neurologists in hospitals throughout the Netherlands. Questions were asked about the use of initial and confirmatory diagnostic imaging tests to assess carotid stenosis in patients with a recent TIA or minor ischemic stroke, criteria to perform confirmatory tests, and criteria for treatment. We also performed hospital-level CEAs to illustrate the consequences of the observed diagnostic strategies in which the diagnostic test costs, sensitivity and specified were varied according to the local hospital conditions. Results 56 % (9/16) of the emergency units and 63 % (10/16) of the outpatient clinics use the initial and confirmatory diagnostic tests to assess carotid stenosis in accordance with the national guidelines. Of the hospitals studied, only one uses the recommended criteria for use of a confirmatory test, 38 % (6/16) follow the guidelines for treatment. The most cost-effective diagnostic test strategy differs between hospitals. Conclusions If important practice variation exists, hospital-level CEAs should be performed. These CEAs should include an assessment of the feasibility and costs of switching to a different strategy.","[Buisman, Leander R.; Rijnsburger, Adriana J.; Redekop, William K.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Buisman, Leander R.; Rijnsburger, Adriana J.; Redekop, William K.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [den Hertog, Heleen M.] Med Spectrum Twente, Dept Neurol, POB 50000, NL-7500 KA Enschede, Netherlands; [den Hertog, Heleen M.] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Neurol, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Lugt, Aad] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, Dept Radiol, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Medical Spectrum Twente; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Buisman, LR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Buisman, LR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",buisman@bmg.eur.nl,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020; Buisman, Leander/E-2151-2013","Buisman, Leander/0000-0001-6767-4614; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083",,,,,18,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Drinkers prefer a particular media; firms recognize this and target alcohol advertising at these media. This paper overcomes this challenge by utilizing novel data with detailed individual measures of media viewing and alcohol consumption and three separate empirical techniques, which represent significant improvements over previous methods. First, controls for the average audience characteristics of the media an individual views account for attributes of magazines and television programs alcohol firms may consider when deciding where to target advertising. A second specification directly controls for each television program and magazine a person views. The third method exploits variation in advertising exposure due to a 2003 change in an industry-wide rule that governs where firms may advertise. Although the unconditional correlation between advertising and drinking by youth (ages 18-24) is strong, models that include simple controls for targeting imply, at most, a modest advertising effect. Although the coefficients are estimated less precisely, estimates with models including more rigorous controls for targeting indicate no significant effect of advertising on youth drinking.

To meet these challenges, which go beyond its disciplinary and territorial organization, the INRA initiated a new system of interdisciplinary piloting of research. Thus, the metaprogramme ACCAF is trying to understand the joint effects of the various modifications caused by climate change on terrestrial farming and natural environments, and to define adaptation strategies of adaptation as well as their environmental and socio-economic consequences. Within this framework, twenty-three research laboratories have been collaborating in the project LACCAVE and united their efforts in the project LACCAVE in order to examine the effects of climate change on the vine and wine sector. In addition to six disciplinary working groups, this project is made up of an interdisciplinary group including researchers and experts of public institution working with the sector, which has carried out a foresight exercise. By directing the reflection towards a medium-long term future (2030-2050), this prospective exercise authorizes us to leave the temporal horizon of the negotiation and the dictatorship of emergency. As the long-term future is neither known nor recognizable, the evolutions are considered as combinations of assumptions expressed in one potential form and its opposite. For the prospective in the LACCAVE program, four strategies of adaptation of viticulture for 2030-2050 were predefined and a collective and pluridisciplinary work made possible the writing of a plausible way of events leading to each strategy.

This technology, implemented on wine during filtration, is very effective for certain substances and impacts only little the wine quality. A laboratory pilot filtration device has been developed in order to confirm the efficiency of this treatment and its impact on the wine quality before its large-scale use in industrial conditions. This simple device is made of a peristaltic pump and a laboratory filter holder. Several wines with different fibre doses and filtration speeds can be rapidly tested, at bottle scale (75 cl).

Lack of diagnostic certainty or possible distress related to a positive result from diagnostic testing could limit the application of new testing technologies. The objective of this paper is to quantify respondents' preferences for obtaining AD diagnostic tests and to estimate the perceived value of AD test information. Methods: Discrete-choice experiment and contingent-valuation questions were administered to respondents in Germany and the United Kingdom. Choice data were analyzed by using random-parameters logit. A probit model characterized respondents who were not willing to take a test. Results: Most respondents indicated a positive value for AD diagnostic test information. Respondents who indicated an interest in testing preferred brain imaging without the use of radioactive markers. German respondents had relatively lower money equivalent values for test features compared with respondents in the United Kingdom. Conclusions: Respondents preferred less invasive diagnostic procedures and tests with higher accuracy and expressed a willingness to pay up to 700 to receive a less invasive test with the highest accuracy.

We find that only father's illness decreases children's school attendance. Father's illness also has long-term impacts on child education, as it decreases children's likelihood of completing primary school and leads to fewer years of schooling. However, we find no evidence that father's illness affects schooling through increased child labor. Instead, father's illness decreases household's income and reduces school attendance possibly because of the reduced ability of the family to afford education. In contrast, mother's illness and illness of other household members have no effect on children's schooling.

We use variation in the industry and union status of covered workers within a county over time to identify the causal effects of generosity. Although OLS estimates fail to reject the hypothesis that generosity facilitates the exercise of hospital market power, IV estimates show a statistically significant and economically important positive effect of plan generosity on hospital prices in uncompetitive markets, but not in competitive markets.

Such measures are unsuitable for use in economic evaluations that require estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year because they are not based on preferences. Objectives: To report the estimation of a preference-based single index for an eight dimensional instrument for MS, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - Eight Dimensions (MSIS-8D), derived from an MS-specific measure of health-related quality of life, the 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). Methods: We elicited preferences for a sample of MSIS-8D states (n = 169) from a sample (n = 1702) of the UK general population. Preferences were elicited using the time trade-off technique via an Internet-based survey. We fitted regression models to these data to estimate values for all health states described by the MSIS-8D. Estimated values were assessed against MSIS-29 scores and values derived from generic preference-based measures in a large, representative sample of people with MS. Results: Participants reported that the time trade-off questions were easy to understand. Observed health state values ranged from 0.08 to 0.89. The best performing model was a main effects, random effects model (mean absolute error = 0.04). Validation analyses support the performance of the MSIS-8D index: it correlated more strongly than did generic measures with MSIS-29 scores, and it discriminated effectively between subgroups of people with MS. Conclusions: The MSIS-8D enables health state values to be estimated from the MSIS-29, adding to the methods available to assess health outcomes and to estimate quality adjusted life-years for MS for use in health technology assessment and decision-making contexts.","[Goodwin, Elizabeth; Green, Colin; Spencer, Anne] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, Exeter EX12LU, Devon, England; [Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, UK Natl Inst Hlth Res NIHR, Collaborat Leadership Appl Hlth Res & Care South, Exeter EX12LU, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Goodwin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Res, South Cloisters,St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX12LU, Devon, England.",e.goodwin@exeter.ac.uk,,"Goodwin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1351-9170; Spencer, Anne/0000-0002-8163-3103",Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Peninsula Medical School Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network; NIHR; UK NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC),Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Peninsula Medical School Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); UK NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC),"The South West Impact of Multiple Sclerosis (SWIMS) project has been supported through funding from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Peninsula Medical School Foundation, and the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network.

The paper aims to explore whether conditional mean effects provide a suitable representation of the national variation in hospital costs. A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (ICD-9 codes 174 and ICD-10 C50 codes) is derived using routinely collected individual breast cancer data from Finland, the metropolitan area of Turin (Italy), Norway, Scotland and Sweden. Conditional mean effects are estimated by ordinary least squares for each country, and quantile regressions are used to explore heterogeneity across the conditional quantile distribution. Point estimates based on conditional mean effects provide a good approximation of treatment response for some key demographic and diagnostic specific variables (e.g. age and ICD-10 diagnosis) across the conditional quantile distribution. For many policy variables of interest, however, there is considerable evidence of parameter heterogeneity that is concealed if decisions are based solely on conditional mean results. The use of quantile regression methods reinforce the need to consider beyond an average effect given the greater recognition that breast cancer is a complex disease reflecting patient heterogeneity.

Those resources accelerate the review of new drugs. Faster approvals allow firms to realize profits sooner, and the program is supported politically by industry. However, published estimates of the value to firms of reduced regulatory delay vary dramatically. It is shown here that this variation is driven largely by differences in methods that correspond to differences in implicit assumptions about the effects of reduced delay. Theoretical modeling is used to derive an equation describing the relationship between estimates generated using different methods. The method likely to yield the most accurate results is identified. A reconciliation of published estimates yields a value to a firm for a one-year reduction in regulatory delay at the time of approval of about $60 million for a typical drug. Published 2015.

The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of cost-effectiveness and other factors on NICE decisions and whether NICE's decision-making has changed over time. We model NICE's decisions as binary choices for or against a health care technology in a specific patient group. Independent variables comprised of the following: clinical and economic evidence; characteristics of patients, disease or treatment; and contextual factors potentially affecting decision-making. Data on all NICE decisions published by December 2011 were obtained from HTAinSite [www.htainsite.com]. Cost-effectiveness alone correctly predicted 82% of decisions; few other variables were significant and alternative model specifications had similar performance. There was no evidence that the threshold has changed significantly over time. The model with highest prediction accuracy suggested that technologies costing 40000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) have a 50% chance of NICE rejection (75% at 52000 pound/QALY; 25% at 27000 pound/QALY). Past NICE decisions appear to have been based on a higher threshold than 20000- pound 30000 pound/QALY. However, this may reflect consideration of other factors that cannot be easily quantified.

The solution to this extremal criterion recovers the unknown density of heterogeneous AR parameters.

Outcome assessments are used to define efficacy endpoints when developing a therapy for a disease or condition. Most efficacy endpoints are based on specified clinical assessments of patients. When clinical assessments are used as clinical trial outcomes, they are called clinical outcome assessments (COAs). COAs include any assessment that may be influenced by human choices, judgment, or motivation. COAs must be well-defined and possess adequate measurement properties to demonstrate (directly or indirectly) the benefits of a treatment In contrast, a biomarker assessment is one that is subject to little, if any, patient motivational or rater judgmental influence. This is the first of two reports by the ISPOR Clinical Outcomes Assessment Emerging Good Practices for Outcomes Research Task Force. This report provides foundational definitions important for an understanding of COA measurement principles. The foundation provided in this report includes what it means to demonstrate a beneficial effect, how assessments of patients relate to the objective of showing a treatment's benefit, and how these assessments are used in clinical trial endpoints. In addition, this report describes intrinsic attributes of patient assessments and clinical trial factors that can affect the properties of the measurements. These factors should be considered when developing or refining assessments. These considerations will aid investigators designing trials in their choice of using an existing assessment or developing a new outcome assessment Although the focus of this report is on the development of a new COA to define endpoints in a clinical trial, these principles may be applied more generally. A critical element in appraising or developing a COA is to describe the treatment's intended benefit as an effect on a clearly identified aspect of how a patient feels or functions. l'his aspect must have importance to the patient and be part of the patient's typical life. this meaningful health aspect can be measured directly or measured indirectly when it is impractical to evaluate it directly or when it is difficult to measure. For indirect measurement, a concept of interest (COI) can be identified. The COI must be related to how a patient feels or functions. Procedures are then developed to measure the COI. The relationship of these measurements with how a patient feels or functions in the intended setting and manner of use of the COA (the context of use) could then be defined. A COA has identifiable attributes or characteristics that affect the measurement properties of the COA when used in endpoints. One of these features is whether judgment can influence the measurement, and if so, whose judgment. This attribute defines four categories of COAs: patient reported outcomes, clinician reported outcomes, observer reported outcomes, and performance outcomes. A full description as well as explanation of other important COA features is included in this report. The information in this report should aid in the development, refinement, and standardization of COAs, and, ultimately, improve their measurement propeities.","[Walton, Marc K.] Janssen Res & Dev, Titusville, NJ USA; [Powers, Johnh.

This result enables us to infer the utility and risk aversion of agents from their investment choice in a non-parametric way. We relate the property of decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) to distributional properties of the terminal wealth and of the financial market. Specifically, we show that DARA is equivalent to a demand for a terminal wealth that has more spread than the opposite of the log pricing kernel at the investment horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This allows for both fat-tailedness and asymmetric dependence between the returns on the underlying asset and the exchange rate. In an empirical application, we estimate the market and risk-neutral parameters for a quanta construction involving the Nikkei 225 index, as the underlying asset, and the Japanese yen and the US dollar exchange rate. While the Gaussian model is clearly rejected by the data, the NTS model cannot be rejected at any reasonable level. A calibration exercise demonstrates that the prices implied by the estimated NTS and the conventional Gaussian models differ substantially, with the NTS model yielding a superior performance as it better reflects the tail properties of the instruments involved.

Nevertheless, it might result in better patient outcomes, without further increasing costs. Because early initiation of treatment is of vital importance for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), these care processes were redesigned. Objectives: This study aimed to assess patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this redesign. Methods: An economic (Markov) model was constructed to evaluate the biopsy process of suspicious lesion under local instead of general anesthesia, and combining computed tomography and positron emission tomography for diagnostics and radiotherapy planning. Patients treated for HNC were included in the model stratified by disease location (larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and oral cavity) and stage (I-II and 111-IV). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Waiting time before treatment start reduced from 5 to 22 days for the included patient groups, resulting in 0.13 to 0.66 additional quality-adjusted life-years. The new workflow was cost-effective for all the included patient groups, using a ceiling ratio of (sic)80,000 or (sic)20,000. For patients treated for tumors located at the larynx and oral cavity, the new workflow resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years, and costs decreased compared with the regular workflow. The health care payer benefited (sic)14.1 million and (sic)91.5 million, respectively, when individual net monetary benefits were extrapolated to an organizational level and a national level. Conclusions: The redesigned care process reduced the waiting time for the treatment of patients with HNC and proved cost-effective. Because care improved, implementation on a wider scale should be considered. Copyright (C) 2015, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

However, in finite samples, the inclusion of an excessive number of moments increases the bias. To solve this problem, we propose regularized versions of the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) based on three different regularizations: Tikhonov, Landweber-Fridman, and principal components. Our estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under heteroskedastic error. Moreover, they reach the semiparametric efficiency bound assuming homoskedastic error. We show that the regularized LIML estimators possess finite moments when the sample size is large enough. The higher order expansion of the mean square error (MSE) shows the dominance of regularized LIML over regularized two-staged least squares estimators. We devise a data driven selection of the regularization parameter based on the approximate MSE. A Monte Carlo study and two empirical applications illustrate the relevance of our estimators.

For any capacity level, the monopolist solves the intertemporal price discrimination problem within the dynamic setting generated by the standard mathematical epidemiological model of infectious diseases. Even though consumers are assumed to be identical, the monopolist will be able to exploit the ex post heterogeneity between infected and susceptible individuals by raising the price of vaccine in response to the increasing hazard rate. The monopolist thus bases its investment decision on the expected profits from the optimal price path given the infection dynamics. It is shown that the monopolist will always choose to invest in a lower production capacity than the social planner. Through numerical simulation, it is demonstrated how the loss to society of having a monopoly producer decreases with the speed of infection transmission. Moreover, it is illustrated how the monopolist's optimal vaccination rate increases as its discount rate rises for cost parameters based on Swedish data. However, the effect of the firm discount rate on its investment decision is sensitive to assumptions regarding the cost of production capacity.

This paper highlights the key role of credit market imperfections at the household level to explain bubble fluctuations and exhibits the stabilizing power of monetary rules responding to asset prices. We consider an overlapping generations exchange economy where households realize a portfolio choice between money and a bubble. Money is held because of a partial cash-in-advance constraint affected by the size of the bubble. A higher value of the bubble reduces the need of cash, and thus increases the fraction of consumption purchased on credit. Under these credit market features, multiplicity of steady-states (global indeterminacy) and expectation-driven fluctuations (local indeterminacy) can occur for arbitrarily small market distortions. Investing the stabilizing role of monetary policy, we show that when the monetary policy rule responds only to expected inflation, a more active rule can be destabilizing by promoting local indeterminacy and has no impact on the multiplicity of steady states. In contrast to the previous policy, when the rule responds also to asset prices, then the monetary policy can be stabilizing and rule out the multiplicity of steady states. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In each of these cases, the adjustment factor has very little structure imposed on it, and thus these models provide little guidance as to which function to use from the infinite class of possible alternatives. In this paper, we provide a simple axiomatic characterization of mean-dispersion preferences which uniquely determines a subjective probability distribution over a set of possible priors and which uniquely identifies the dispersion function. We provide an algorithm for determining this subjective probability distribution and the coefficient in the dispersion function from experimental data. We also demonstrate that the model accommodates ambiguity aversion in the Ellsberg paradox. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Sögner, L",,,,"Soegner, Leopold",,,"Learning, convergence and economic constraints",MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; COBWEB MODEL,"This article investigates a partial equilibrium production model with dynamic information aggregation. Firms use observed prices to estimate the unknown model parameter by applying Bayesian learning. In the baseline setting, the demand structure is linear and the noise term is Gaussian. Then, prices and quantities are supported by the real line and convergence of the limited information to rational expectations quantities is obtained. Since a production economy is considered, the economic constraint of non-negative quantities is imposed. This non-negativity constraint and the assumption that signals about demand are only received in periods where production takes place destroy the optimistic convergence result observed in the baseline model. With this constraint firms learning an unknown demand intercept parameter exit with strictly positive probability, even when the true value of this parameter would induce production in the full information setting. In a second step, the linear demand structure is replaced by piece-wise linear demand, such that prices become non-negative. Also in this stetting the convergence result of the baseline model does not hold. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As such, the tests do not require the choice of tuning parameters associated with bandwidth or lag length and also do not require choices with respect to numbers of common factors. The tests allow for unrestricted cross-sectional dependence and dynamic heterogeneity among the units of the panel, provided simply that a joint functional central limit theorem holds for the panel of differenced series. We provide a discussion of the relationships between our setting and the settings for which first- and second generation panel unit root tests are designed. In Monte Carlo simulations we illustrate the small-sample performance of our tests when they are used as panel unit root tests under the more restrictive DGPs for which panel unit root tests are typically designed, and for more general DGPs we also compare the small-sample performance of our nonparametric tests to parametric rank tests. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration by testing for income convergence among countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A database of SMC submissions between 2006 and 2013 was created, containing a range of clinical, economic, and other factors extracted from published health technology assessment reports. A binomial outcome variable was used, defined as the decision to accept for use or not recommend a technology. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the impact by means of odds ratios (ORs) of the submitted evidence on the recommendation decision. Results: Out of 463 applications, 265 were accepted for use (57%) and 198 (43%) were not recommended for use within National Health Service Scotland. Univariate analyses showed that 13 variables significantly affected the SMC decision. Of these 13 variables, 7 variables were shown to have a meaningful impact in the multivariate analysis. Four of these concerned the outcome of cost-effectiveness analyses; the fact that a submission was supported by a cost-minimization analysis was the strongest positive variable (OR = 10.30) and a submission showing a product not being cost-effective (i.e., incremental cost-effectiveness ratio above E30,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained) was the strongest negative predictor (OR = 0.47). The other variables concerned whether the submission was related to a product indicated for a nervous system disease (OR = 0.41), whether it was indicated for nonchronic use (OR = 1.66), and whether the submission was performed by a big company (OR = 2.83). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the outcome of cost-effectiveness analyses is an important factor affecting the SMC's reimbursement recommendation decision.","[Charokopou, Mata; Majer, Istvan M.; de Raad, Johan; Broekhuizen, Stefan; Heeg, Bart] Pharmerit BV, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon PE2, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Charokopou, M (通讯作者)，Marten Meesweg 107, NL-3068 AV Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mcharokopou@pharmerit.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,26,29,30,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,284,291,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.12.008,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773564.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300019,0

We evaluate the effect of increases in the performance thresholds required for maximum payment under the Quality and Outcomes Framework in April 2006. A difference-in-differences estimator with fixed effects was employed to examine the number of patients treated under clinical indicators whose payment schedules were revised and to compare these with the figures for those indicators whose schedules remained unchanged. The results suggest that the increase in the maximum performance thresholds increased GPs' performance by 1.77% on average. Low-performing GPs improved significantly more (13.22%) than their high-performing counterparts (0.24%). Changes to maximum performance thresholds are differentially effective in incentivising GPs and could be used further to raise GPs' performance across all indicators.

This paper estimates the causal effect of Medicaid-financed home care services on the costs and utilization of institutional long-term care using Medicaid claims data. A unique instrumental variable was applied to address the potential bias caused by omitted variables or reverse effect of institutional care use. We find that the use of Medicaid-financed home care services significantly reduced but only partially offset utilization and Medicaid expenditures on nursing facility services. A $1000 increase in Medicaid home care expenditures avoided 2.75days in nursing facilities and reduced annual Medicaid nursing facility costs by $351 among people over age 65 when selection bias is addressed. Failure to address selection biases would misestimate the substitution and offset effects.

When m, n -> infinity, the corresponding Studentized test statistic is asymptotically N(0, 1). Holding m fixed instead, the asymptotic distribution contains the Edgeworth expansion term capturing the variance of the quantile spacing. Consequently, the fixed-m distribution is more accurate than the standard normal under both asymptotic frameworks. A testing-optimal in is proposed to maximize power subject to size control. In simulations, the new method controls size better than similar methods while maintaining good power. Throughout are results for two-sample quantile treatment effect inference.

Data was collected from 417 full-time employees from the financial companies in China. Hierarchical regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. Results indicated that transformational leadership was negatively associated with feedback-seeking behavior. Core self-evaluations moderated the relationship between them. And with high core self-evaluations, transformational leadership was positively related to feedback-seeking behavior for employees, whereas this relationship for employees with low core self-evaluations was negative. The results present a deeper understanding of how employees weigh various factors in deciding whether to seek feedback within the organization. These findings have important implications for understanding the causes of feedback-seeking behavior under the background of Chinese enterprise culture.","[An Li-yang; Zhang Li] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Zhang Shao-bin] China Mobile Grp Heilongjiang Co Ltd, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; China Mobile,"An, LY (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472054],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71472054),,41,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1051,1058,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600139,0
