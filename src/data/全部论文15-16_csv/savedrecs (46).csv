However, some of the new-found effects remain disputable due to limited evidence. This study aims to provide suggestive guidelines for future research by identifying the mechanisms that can generate larger economic impacts at the aggregate. The analysis is based on a dynamic general equilibrium world model that is calibrated to published statistics and incorporates empirical estimates on the effects of brain drain. It simulates short- and long-run impacts of increased brain drain on GDP per capita, GNI per capita, and income inequality. The results suggest that more studies should be conducted to further examine how the brain drain influences human capital formation and technology spillovers. Both have significant impacts on domestic production and national income. A better understanding of different remitting patterns is also desirable to understand how to reduce inequality and promote recipients' investment in productive assets.","[Lodigiani, Elisabetta] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy; [Lodigiani, Elisabetta] Ctr Luca Agliano, Venice, Italy; [Marchiori, Luca] Cent Bank Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Shen, I-Ling] South Coast Air Qual Management Dist, Diamond Bar, CA USA",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Lodigiani, E (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy.;Lodigiani, E (通讯作者)，Ctr Luca Agliano, Venice, Italy.",,,"Lodigiani, Elisabetta/0000-0003-0638-5215; Marchiori, Luca/0000-0003-4256-2311",,,,,49,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2016,39.0,4,,,SI,,557,573,,10.1111/twec.12269,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DJ5OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374258700007,0

The top tails of the distributions of aggregate and high-skilled immigrants and emigrants adhere to a Pareto distribution with an exponent of unity, that is Zipf's law holds. We find some evidence in favour of Gibrat's law holding for immigration stocks, such that the growth in stocks is independent of their initial values and stronger evidence that immigration densities are diverging over time. Conversely, emigrant stocks are converging in the sense that countries with smaller emigrant stocks are growing faster than their larger sovereign counterparts. Lastly, high-skilled immigration and emigration stocks expressed in levels or as densities all exhibit signs of convergence. We conclude by discussing some competing mechanisms that could be driving the observed patterns including differing fertility rates, reductions in emigration restrictions, migrant sorting and selective immigration policies, immigrant networks and persisting wage differentials.","[Ozden, Caglar] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Parsons, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England",The World Bank; University of Oxford,"Özden, Ç (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,"Parsons, Christopher/0000-0001-8528-4089",Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); French Government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); French Government,"We are grateful to Hillel Rapoport, Ferdinand Rauch and an anonymous referee for useful and timely comments and would like to extend our gratitude to Simone Bertoli and Frederic Docquier for their combined encouragement for writing this paper.

This paper offers new quantitative evidence of the impact of INGOs in one specific policy area-Freedom of Information (FOI) laws-as well as highlighting an under-studied mechanism of INGO influence on the design of domestic laws. I test this argument by examining the effect of legal analyses of draft FOI legislation published by the INGO Article 19. These analyses provide expert legal assessments and make normative evaluations-both information politics and symbolic politics. I find that in countries in which Article 19 conducted legal analyses, the design of the subsequently passed FOI laws was significantly stronger than in countries that were not subject to such analyses. I demonstrate that this finding is not an artifact of Article 19's selection process. I also present suggestive evidence that highlights symbolic politics, not information politics, as the more salient mechanism. Finally, I examine the process of FOI drafting and adoption in Serbia to illustrate the argument and specific mechanisms at work.","[Berliner, Daniel] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Coor Hall,6th Floor,POB 873902, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Berliner, D (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Coor Hall,6th Floor,POB 873902, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",danberliner@gmail.com,,"Berliner, Daniel/0000-0002-0285-0215",University of Washington European Union Center of Excellence; Kolleg-Forschergruppe (KFG) The Transformative Power of Europe,University of Washington European Union Center of Excellence; Kolleg-Forschergruppe (KFG) The Transformative Power of Europe,"This study was supported by the University of Washington European Union Center of Excellence, and the Kolleg-Forschergruppe (KFG) The Transformative Power of Europe hosted at Freie Universitat Berlin.",,61,12,14,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Vote swapping consists of exchanging votes between two voters from two different jurisdictions in order to beat a candidate that both voters dislike. The recent debates and legal disputes about this manipulation device raise some important ethical issues. We adopt an axiomatic approach, first establishing the relationship between vote swapping and a restricted form of gerrymandering, which is another way of manipulating elections in representative democracies. We then look for voting rules that are immune to such manipulations and show that any such voting rules only exist if either the voters or the candidates are given unreasonable power.","[Bervoets, Sebastian] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Bervoets, Sebastian] EHESS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Merlin, Vincent] CNRS, UFR Sci Econ, CREM UMR 6211, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14000 Caen, France; [Merlin, Vincent] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14000 Caen, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Caen Normandie,"Bervoets, S (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.;Bervoets, S (通讯作者)，EHESS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",sebastian.bervoets@univ-amu.fr; vincent.merlin@unicaen.fr,,,"French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 13 JSH1 0009 01, ANR 14 CE24 0007 02]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-JSH1-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),S.

In contrast to the existing approach, we explicitly examine the relationship between domestic investment and foreign savings rather than domestic savings. In terms of addressing the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle, our results based on a panel of OECD and emerging market economies initially suggest that the depth and extent of capital mobility remain generally limited and that mobility has increased over the past 20 years. However, in contrast to existing studies, we find that capital mobility between Euro and EU pairs is more extensive than between pairs that involve other countries. If our sample is expanded to include emerging markets, we find that capital mobility has also increased though is weaker than for OECD economies. We provide additional insight in terms of consistency between our assessment of capital mobility based on the Feldstein-Horioka condition (a quantity approach) and a price approach based on real interest rate differentials.","[Holmes, Mark J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Otero, Jesus] Univ Rosario, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia",University of Waikato; Universidad del Rosario,"Holmes, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",holmesmj@waikato.ac.nz; jesus.otero@urosario.edu.co,"Otero, Jesus/G-1038-2011; Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010","Otero, Jesus/0000-0002-2551-0053; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324",,,,,36,4,4,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using data from the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) Establishment Panel from 1996 through 2012, the effect of economic promotion in the eastern part of Germany is studied on a number of indicators that provide insight into the topic. For this purpose, conditional difference-in-differences estimators were derived using a propensity score matching approach. Treated establishments in the area of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) invested more, had a higher value added and requested more labour than untreated firms when the amount of public funding is considered. However, on average, establishments with a history of previous investments also receive more funding than establishments that do not receive promotion. Also, some of the results are not permanent, such as the share of investment. Other effects of economic promotion in Germany include increases in wages, but these effects are rather small when compared to the size of the economic promotion. In addition, outcome for firms' productivity is always insignificant and close to zero.","[Koelling, Arnd] HWR Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Alt Friedrichsfelde 60, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Kölling, A (通讯作者)，HWR Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Alt Friedrichsfelde 60, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.",arnd.koelling@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We found that religious similarity contributes to increased international trade in services by establishing trust-related institutions'. Second, religious pluralism (variety) fosters trade even more than religious similarity, suggesting that in facilitating trade, religious openness matters more than religious similarity. Third, a strong dominant religion discourages trade in services, whereas the presence of religious minorities encourages trade in services. A highly significant inverse Mill's ratio (IMR) result indicated the presence of sample selection bias, indicating that controls are necessary to prevent estimation bias. This study concluded that religion is an important determining factor for trade in services, positively affecting interpersonal trust and thereby reducing institutional distance between countries.","[Lee, Chong Wha; Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Kongju National University,"Lee, CW (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea.",,,"Park, Soonchan/0000-0001-8389-852X",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2054749],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),Soonchan Park's Research is supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2054749).,,33,8,9,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2016,39.0,3,,,,,409,425,,10.1111/twec.12276,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DI2WZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373361200005,0

In this paper, we estimate a dynamic equation for female labour force participation in OECD countries from 1980 to 2007, taking into account several sets of variables. Moreover, we use our model to predict the results for 2007-2011, and we find that our model adjusts quite well to the actual data even with regard to the out-sample observations during the ongoing recession. In order to gain further insight concerning the interpretation and robustness of the equation, it is then compared to a similar equation for males. Our results show that real wage is one of the most relevant variables for female participation. Thus our specification could also be useful to endogenise labour force participation for a macro-labour market framework such as that of Layard et al. (1991, rev. 2005). However, women's preferences, the overall level of education, and other structural factors are also important.","[Pena-Boquete, Yolanda] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Univ Lagoas, Vigo 36200, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Pena-Boquete, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Univ Lagoas, Vigo 36200, Spain.",y.penaboquete@uvigo.es,,"Pena Boquete, Yolanda/0000-0002-8884-2223",Xunta de Galicia through fellowship programme Anxeles Alvarino; Univerversity of Vigo,Xunta de Galicia through fellowship programme Anxeles Alvarino; Univerversity of Vigo,"The author wishes to acknowledge the financial support of Xunta de Galicia, through the fellowship programme Anxeles Alvarino and Univerversity of Vigo (bolsas de mobilidade).

I find that given a school start time, students learn more in the morning than later in the school day. Having a morning instead of afternoon math or English class increases a student's GPA by 0.072 (0.006) and 0.032 (0.006), respectively.

In this paper, I analyse the sector bias of both factor-neutral and factor-biased technical change. In Norwegian data from 1972 to 2007, the empirical evidence is not clear on the impact of a sector bias of skill-biased technical change, but it points to a sector bias of factor-neutral technical change from the 1970s to the 1990s. That said, the impact of the sector bias seems to have reduced towards the latter part of the sample period. I also evaluate the cross-sectional model used in the literature and show the strong restrictions that must be placed on a vector equilibrium correction model to end up with the standard model. If these restrictions do not hold, the results reported in the literature may be biased. I show that the restrictions are strongly rejected, and that erroneously imposing them significantly changes the estimates of skill-biased technical change in many sectors. These results can, to some extent, be traced back to how the cross-sectional model ignores initial disequilibrium and imposes factors of production to be either complements or substitutes.","[von Brasch, Thomas] Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [von Brasch, Thomas] NUPI, Dept Int Econ, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"von Brasch, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",vonbrasch@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,2,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It highlights the endogenous, temporal effects of inter-national institutions at the core of global economic governance: transnational regulatory networks and the soft law they produce. Transnational soft law is not simply an articulation of a focal point, we demonstrate, but also a political resource that may be employed by reform-minded agents dissatisfied with their domestic policy status quo. We label such feedback processes 'templates-as-disruptors,' meaning that the establishment of transnational soft law by regulatory networks at t(1) creates policy templates that disrupt pre-existing internal (e.g. domestic) political contests at t(2). In addition to improving an understanding of historical events and great power preference alignment, the paper highlights the temporal effects of informal cooperation and domestic--international interaction in global governance.","[Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Posner, Elliot] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Georgetown University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Newman, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,"Posner, Elliot/0000-0002-7178-6528",Fulbright US Scholar Program,Fulbright US Scholar Program,Elliot Posner received research support from the Fulbright US Scholar Program.,,109,33,36,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Savage is significantly different from the one advanced by J. M. Keynes and Frank H. Knight. Recent studies seem to have overlooked this aspect of de Finetti and Savage's 1962 paper Sul Modo di Scegliere le Probabilita Iniziali. This particular work has been cited as supporting the claim that there are similarities between the de Finetti-Savage's conception of uncertainty and the Keynes-Knight's approach. This claim, however, loses much of its appeal once it is realized that the discussion by de Finetti and Savage involves only the initial probabilities.","[Arthmar, Rogerio] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Econ, Vitoria, Spain; [Brady, Michael Emmett] Calif State Univ, Dept Operat Management, Long Beach, CA 90802 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Arthmar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Econ, Vitoria, Spain.;Brady, ME (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Dept Operat Management, Long Beach, CA 90802 USA.",rogerio.arthmar@ufes.br; mandmbrady@juno.com,"Arthmar, Rogerio/J-8651-2012","Arthmar, Rogerio/0000-0001-7085-2645",CNPq [307080/2012-9],CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from CNPq, grant 307080/2012-9.",,36,4,4,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The internet portal of JSC << Federal Corporation for Developing Small and Medium-sized Business >> (SME Corporation) was used as information base of the research. General scientific research methods were used in the data processing: the comparative analysis, graphical analysis, synthesis, grouping, generalization. The following results are obtained. First, the state support infrastructure of small and medium-sized-sized businesses in five main support directions is researched: financial, property, consulting, innovative and production, legal infrastructures. Second, the analysis of presence of the regional organizations in each direction of support infrastructure in the subjects of the Russian Federation was carried out. Third, the subjects of the Russian Federation with the most developed support infrastructure both within one direction, and on a set of directions of the state support were distinguished.

This is the first polynomial-time algorithm for most of the known tractable classes of Arrow-Debreu markets, which is easy to implement and avoids heavy machinery such as the ellipsoid method. In addition, our algorithm can be applied in an unknown market setting without exact knowledge about the number of agents, their individual utilities and endowments. Instead, our algorithm only relies on queries to a global demand oracle by posting prices and receiving aggregate demand for goods as feedback. When demands are real-valued functions of prices, the oracles can only return values of bounded precision based on real utility functions. Due to this more realistic assumption, precision and representation of prices and demands become a major technical challenge, and we develop new tools and insights that may be of independent interest. Furthermore, our approach also gives the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute an exact equilibrium for markets with spending constraint utilities, a piecewise linear concave generalization of linear utilities.

Moreover, we impose a chance (probabilistic) constraint on the portfolio return which must be fulfilled with a high probability. This leads to a difficult nonconvex multiobjective stochastic programming problem. Under discretely distributed returns, this problem can be solved using the CCP-SIR solver (Chance Constrained Problems: Successive Iterative Regularization) which has been recently introduced by Adam and Branda [1]. This algorithm relies on a relaxed nonlinear programming problem and its regularized version obtained by enlarging the set of feasible solutions using regularizing functions. These both formulations as well as the solution technique are discussed in details. We report the results for a real life portfolio problem of a small investor. We compare the CCP-SIR solver with BONMIN applied to the deterministic mixed-integer reformulation.","[Branda, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Branda, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic.",branda@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Branda, Martin/M-4304-2013","Branda, Martin/0000-0002-6519-1608",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,67,72,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500012,0

The article partly extends the previous research on willingness of young people to start own business rather than seeking for perceived comfort of employment. The main research areas focused on how prestigious and attractive the crafts are perceived, which particular crafts are currently evaluated the best, and we investigated whether or not there is a vision of future own entrepreneurship path in the craft branches. Dominant research method was questionnaire in the panel of selected 500 respondents. Major findings show that the genuine craft career as a first choice is opted only in approximately 20% of all respondents. The most attractive crafts in all the evaluated factors are connected with electrician branches. Crafts generally are not perceived very prestigious but most of the respondents believe that prestige will grow in the near future. The article provides insight into possible implications in the area of social perception of craft. One of the reasons is that crafts and generally entrepreneurship largely influence the social cohesion and regional sustainability in any country.","[Breckova, Pavla] Univ Finance & Adm VSFS, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",,"Breckova, P (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm VSFS, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",pavla.breckova@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,225,237,,,,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100022,0

The authors of the paper analyze the attitude of the young people in Nizhnevartovsk (Russia) to the non-titular ethnic groups as the part of regional security enhancement. The young people survey results showed that this demographic group is generally comfortable in the multi-cultural environment of the given territory. However, there are several factors that can destabilize the situation in the city: the negative attitude of the young people aged 14-19 to the non-titular ethnic groups; the ineffective policy of the local authorities, diasporas, public associations and educational institutions with respect to the adaptation of the newcomers; non-intentional and intentional provocative behavior of some individuals and extremist organizations.

Stage 1: callus induction on the media (a) MSo, (b) MSo + 3 mgl(-1) 2,4-D, (c) MSo + 4 mgl(-1) 2,4-D, (d) MSo + 3 mgl(-1) 2,4-D + 1.5 mgl(-1) BAP, (e) MSo + 4 mgl(-1) 2,4-D + 1.5 mgl(-1) BAP, stage 2: proliferation on media MSo + 1.5 mgl(-1) 2,4-D and stage 3: regeneration on MSo media. The results showed that the media ribavirin and acyclovir at 20 mgl(-1) and 40 mgl(-1) concentration produces 100% virus-free sugarcane plantlets. Best embryogenic callus induction media is MSo + 3 mgl(-1) 2,4-D and virus free plantlets have produced as much as +/- 35 plantlets within 9 weeks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Although classical Altman Z model and other models based on MDA are still widely used for failure prediction in many economics, in the paper we analyze the MDA bankruptcy prediction models created in recent 25 years in different countries all over the world. In our analysis we focus on financial ratios used as predictors in these models.

This is not just a theoretical question: many people have used the Spliddit website to obtain envy-free solutions to rent division instances. But envy freeness, in and of itself, is insufficient to guarantee outcomes that people view as intuitive and acceptable. We therefore focus on solutions that optimize a criterion of social justice, subject to the envy freeness constraint, in order to pinpoint the fairest solutions. We develop a general algorithmic framework that enables the computation of such solutions in polynomial time. We then study the relations between natural optimization objectives, and identify the maximin solution, which maximizes the minimum utility subject to envy freeness, as the most attractive. We demonstrate, in theory and using experiments on real data from Spliddit, that the maximin solution gives rise to significant gains in terms of our optimization objectives. Finally, a user study with Spliddit users as subjects demonstrates that people find the maximin solution to be significantly fairer than arbitrary envy-free solutions; this user study is unprecedented in that it asks people about their real-world rent division instances. Based on these results, the maximin solution has been deployed on Spliddit since April 2015.","[Gal, YA'Akov (Kobi); Mash, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Informat Syst Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Procaccia, Ariel D.; Zick, Yair] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Ben Gurion University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Gal, Y (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Informat Syst Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",kobig@bgu.ac.il; mashm@post.bgu.ac.il; arielpro@cs.cmu.edu; yairzick@cs.cmu.edu,"Gal, Ya'akov/F-1567-2012","Gal, Kobi/0000-0001-7187-8572; Zick, Yair/0000-0002-0635-6230",Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1350598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1525932] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1215883] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,20,12,14,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,67,84,,10.1145/2940716.2940724,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300010,0

For each election that we generate, we test whether each of 54 voting rules is (1) nonmanipulable, and (2) efficient in the sense of maximizing summed utilities. We find that Hare and Condorcet-Hare are the most strategy-resistant non-dictatorial rules. Most rules have very similar efficiency scores, apart from a few poor performers such as random dictator, plurality and anti-plurality. Our results are highly robust across data-generating processes. In addition to presenting our numerical results, we explore analytically the effects of adding aCondorcet provision to a base rule and showthat, for all but a few base rules, this modification cannot introduce a possibility of manipulation where none existed before. Our analysis provides support for the Condorcet-Hare rule, which has not been prominent in the literature.","[Green-Armytage, James] Bard Coll, Dept Econ, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Tideman, T.

Rectifying acceptance sampling plans minimizing mean inspection cost per lot of the process average quality were designed by Dodge and Romig for the inspection by attributes. Plans for the inspection by variables were then proposed and such plans may be more economical than the corresponding attributes sampling plans.

However, in spite of the injection of important sums the economic growth remains weak. The growth costs expensive and the economic reforms are blocked owing to the fact that Algeria of share its wealth gives the impression which it can satisfy the needs for the company without passing by the market. The oil price fall has challenged this policy built on public spending. This has induced a decline in revenues, affecting both the foreign exchange reserves which cover 22.2 months of imports and the public budget. The trade balance deficit reached 13.7 billion dollars in 2015. This reversal of unexpected circumstances produced a deep economic crisis. In this work, we will try in the first part to show that public spending resulted in not only low growth rates but very expensive for the national community. Also, these expenditures have inaugurated a return of government intervention when the Algerian economy began to open up the market.

Our novel approach is based on Nolan parametrization of standardized characteristic function of alpha stable distribution which is expanded using Taylor expansion for alpha close to one. The standardized pdf is obtained by fast Fourier transform for fixed parameters alpha and beta in the outer optimization loop. Log likelihood function is realized as look up table with linear interpolation. Therefore, the remaining parameters can be easily determined in the inner optimization loop. This two-phase likelihood maximization methodology is then applied to artificially simulated data for verification and after that to actual returns series of several stock market indices.","[Kukal, Jaromir; Quang Van Tran] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague 2, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Kukal, J (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague 2, Czech Republic.",kukal@fjfi.cvut.cz; tranvqua@fjfi.cvut.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,477,482,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500082,0

With respect to mechanisms, I argue that the core of process tracing with causal inference is the identification of mechanisms understood as intervening events. Events are different from standard intervening variables when used with process tracing, because events are treated as sets in which cases can have membership. With respect to Bayesian analysis, I concur with recent writings that suggest Bayesian inference is at the heart of process tracing. The Bayesian nature of process tracing explains why it is inappropriate to view qualitative research as suffering from a small-N problem and certain standard causal identification problems. More generally, the paper shows how the power of process tracing as a qualitative methodology depends on and grows from its set-theoretic underpinnings.","[Mahoney, James] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mahoney, James] Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Mahoney, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Mahoney, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",james-mahoney@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,31,18,19,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Instead of investing the whole capital Kelly proposed to invest a fraction of the capital. More on a proportional gambling, also known as Kelly gambling, was investigated by Cover and Thomas. Our paper uses principles of a log-optimal portfolio from both sources and an approximation of the main criteria is used instead. Doing this allows us effective statistical inference. Usual procedure is to maximize expected value of the logarithm of the capital after an investment. The obtained solution is not comfortable for use in real-life situations; therefore, we propose alternative approach where the logarithm is substituted by the second-order Taylor polynomial.

The coexistence of high economic growth together with low inflation becomes an essential objective for policymakers. It is particularly interesting to study this relationship in economies converging to the most developed ones, as is the case of Central and Eastern European countries with respect to core economies in the European Union. This paper examines the relationship between inflation and economic growth for six European countries in 1991-2015. This work has a twofold objective. Firstly, to unveil the existence of the relationship in these countries; secondly, to detect a potential different behaviour regarding the impact of inflation on economic growth in these two groups of countries, as they have their idiosyncrasy. The results point to a long-run positive relationship in all countries; regarding the short-run dynamics of economic growth, it is proven to be nonlinear. Following the results, the similarities between the two sets of countries are found out and the policy implications are presented.","[Mourelle, Estefania] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Stankovicova, Iveta] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Universidade da Coruna; Comenius University Bratislava,"Mourelle, E (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",estefania.mourelle@udc.es; iveta.stankovicova@fm.uniba.sk,"Stankovičová, Iveta/ABC-1763-2020; Mourelle, Estefanía/K-9458-2013",,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1292,1301,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100128,0

Today the right to a healthy environment is a fundamental human right. European rules provide for early public participation in environmental impact assessment procedures. The goal is early involvement, and continuous public participation in the process, creating the preconditions that allow the public to significantly affect the outcome of environmental impact assessments. This is regulated with various regulations, and their amendments. Following the adoption of the Aarhus Convention, in 2003 the EU adopted the Directive on Public Participation in the Process of Preparing Plans and Programmes Relating to the Environment. This paper presents the results of empirical research on information and opinion of interested public in the Republic of Croatia according to the differences between the interested public and the public in the procedures on the assessment of environmental impact studies. Qualitative research on the target sample was conducted using in-depth interviews and participatory observation. The grounded theory method was used in the analysis of empirical material, and the quantification of qualitatively processed encrypted material was performed using Statistica 11.00. Most respondents believe that there is a difference between the interested public and the public and explain that the interested public includes the local community and stakeholders directly and immediately interested in a specific project, while the public includes stakeholders who do not belong to the community, and do not have direct interest. Slightly less than half of the respondents think that there is no difference between the public and the interested public due to the fact that this is only legally regulated, insignificant in the environmental process, and only means meeting the legal form and alignment with the EU regulations.","[Pletikosic, Merica] CEMEX, Zagreb, Croatia; [Vlahovic, Majda Tafra] Univ Appl Sci Baltazar, Zapresic, Croatia",,"Pletikosic, M (通讯作者)，CEMEX, Zagreb, Croatia.",merica.pletikosic@cemex.com; majda.tafra@gmail.com,"Tafra, Majda/ABB-5532-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,227,234,,,,,,8,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400023,0

In terms of the relative fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the modeling is simple, and the operation is convenient, but we cannot determine degrees of the project quality. The multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can distinguish the levels of the influencing factors, reduce the difficulty of the assignment of the weights, and can judge whether the scheme itself is good or bad, but the modeling is relatively complicated, and the calculating workload is large, and the membership building is complex. The decision making, as a process, usually clearly puts forward a variety of the alternative schemes and the effects of various schemes through the investigations and studies on the basis of understanding the objective realities and predicting the future development, and then selects an optimal scheme. The commonly used tools for the strategic analysis include many aspects, including the famous PEST analysis, the five kinds of the power models, the value chain analysis, the radar chart analysis and the causal analysis and other tools.

Using data from over 300 T20I matches, we find little evidence that either winning the toss or choosing to bat first improves the likelihood of winning. Despite this, we find that captains in T20I cricket are significantly more likely to choose to bat rather than bowl after winning the toss, a finding that is consistent with social pressure constraining captains' decision making.","[Sacheti, Abhinav; Paton, David] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Gregory-Smith, Ian] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield,"Paton, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",david.paton@nottingham.ac.uk,"Paton, David/E-7286-2011","Paton, David/0000-0002-7486-9353",,,,,25,2,2,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Computing the upper bound of the sample variance is an NP-hard problem, however, there exist some efficient algorithms for various special cases. Using Ferson's algorithm, the computation of the maximal possible variance over interval-valued dataset can be realized in polynomial time in the maximal number of narrowed intervals intersecting at one point; narrowed means that the intervals are shrinked proportionally to the size of the dataset. Considering random datasets, experiments conducted by Sokol allowed for conjecturing that the maximal number of narrowed intervals intersecting at one point is at most of logarithmic size for a reasonable choice of the data-generating process. Here, we assume uniform distribution of centers and constant radii. Under this setting, we show that the computation of expected value of the maximal number of narrowed intervals intersecting at one point (which is random variable here) is reducible to the evaluation of the volume of some special simplicial cuts.","[Sokol, Ondrej; Rada, Miroslav] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sokol, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic.",ondrej.sokol@vse.cz; miroslav.rada@vse.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,779,784,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500134,0

Overall, the growth of each strain was similar over the 20-40 degrees C and 0.90-0.98 a(w) ranges but optimal condition was found to be around 0.95 a(w) and 30 degrees C. Under severe aw stress (0.90 a(w)) with elevated temperature (40 degrees C), differences were observed in growth responses, with some strains unable to grow. The lag phases were significantly increased at marginal temperature and aw levels. The combined factors showed statistical interaction for growth rate (P < 0.05), while there was no evidence of statistical interaction effect on the lag phases prior to growth (P > 0.05). Growth rate under more freely available water conditions (> 0.95 a(w)), the disordinal interaction was observed when strains were cultured at higher temperatures (> 30 degrees C). In contrast, growth rate with cooler temperatures at < 30 degrees C showed ordinal interaction. Growth rates were fastest at 0.95 a(w) and 30 degrees C.

According to Roosevelt (1910), The object of government is the welfare of the people. The material progress and prosperity of the nation are desirable chiefly so far as they lead to the moral and material welfare of all good citizens. This target - moral and material welfare of all citizens - should be the essential thing when developing tax policy from the welfare approach. Therefore the present article has focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of both positive and negative roles of alcohol excise taxes in the context of the welfare state. In spite of the harmonization of excise taxes in the European Union (EU), the policy and actions of the national governments on alcohol excise taxes differ, because the need for regulation using this tax is based on factors of social and economic environment in the country. So, systematic framework is necessary to assess efficiency of EU countries governments' alcohol excise tax policy in the context of the welfare state, to determine the role of alcohol excise tax in the structure of the welfare state tax system and to identify key factors influencing effectiveness of alcohol excise tax regulation.","[Starkauskiene, Viktorija; Levisauskaite, Kristina; Maksvytiene, Inga] Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Starkauskiene, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",viktorija.starkauskiene@vdu.lt; kristina.levisauskaite@vdu.lt; inga.maksvytiene@vdu.lt,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1723,1735,,,,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100171,0

However, there are still some growing pains remaining. An important one is the delivery method of parcels, both the strength of e-commerce as the Achilles heel. First of all, the costs of delivery are substantial. If the cargo interest decides to use his right of withdrawal, such costs remain with the webshop. Moreover, parcels get lost or damaged during delivery, while the risk remains with the webshop and the recourse possibilities against the carrier are often very limited. Finally, e-commerce still can't provide the same consumer experience as physical sales, as consumers can't. test. their orders. Even though this is possible at home, the consumer has to pay the costs of reshipment and might see the time investment of reshipment as an obstacle. Webshops meet these concerns by providing for free reshipment, but this further increases the costs. In this paper, two alternatives to deal with these obstacles are introduced. The first one is cooperative e-commerce, whereby different specialized webshops act as mutual delivery points, where parcels of the other webshops can be picked up, tested and left behind in case of a change of preferences. This creates a proximity without having to engage in expensive delivery at home. In the second model this role is performed by individual loyal consumers, who will play a role as ambassadors and accept delivery at home for consumers choosing this delivery point. Albeit such delivery methods seem to be valid complementary alternatives, there are different legal obstacles to such alternative delivery methods. In this paper, after investigating the current obstacles, we investigate the liability impact of both alternatives..","[Wouter, Verheyen] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wouter, Verheyen] Odisee UC Brussels, Brussels, Belgium",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Wouter, V (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Wouter, V (通讯作者)，Odisee UC Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.",verheyen@law.eur.nl,,"Verheyen, Wouter/0000-0003-4940-8712",,,,,18,0,0,0,21,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,653,661,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400067,0

Here there are two players, a defender and an attacker. The defender wants to allocate her limited resources to defend critical targets and the attacker seeks his most favorable target to attack. In the past decade, there has been a surge of research interest in analyzing and solving security games that are motivated by applications from various domains. Remarkably, these models and their game-theoretic solutions have led to real-world deployments in use by major security agencies like the LAX airport, the US Coast Guard and Federal Air Marshal Service, as well as non-governmental organizations. Among all these research and applications, equilibrium computation serves as a foundation. This paper examines security games from a theoretical perspective and provides a unified view of various security game models. In particular, each security game can be characterized by a set system E which consists of the defender's pure strategies; The defender's best response problem can be viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem over E. Our framework captures most of the basic security game models in the literature, including all the deployed systems; The set system E arising from various domains encodes standard combinatorial problems like bipartite matching, maximum coverage, min-cost flow, packing problems, etc. Our main result shows that equilibrium computation in security games is essentially a combinatorial problem. In particular, we prove that, for any set system E, the following problems can be reduced to each other in polynomial time: (0) combinatorial optimization over E; (1) computing the minimax equilibrium for zero-sum security games over E; (2) computing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium for security games over E; (3) computing the best or worst (for the defender) Nash equilibrium for security games over E. Therefore, the hardness [polynomial solvability] of any of these problems implies the hardness [polynomial solvability] of all the others. Here, by games over E we mean the class of security games with arbitrary payoff structures, but a fixed set E of defender pure strategies. This shows that the complexity of a security game is essentially determined by the set system E. We view drawing these connections as an important conceptual contribution of this paper.","[Xu, Haifeng] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Xu, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",haifengx@usc.edu,,,,,,,36,16,23,1,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,497,514,,,,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300042,0

We have shown by Monte-Carlo experiments that the new selection procedure improves considerably the Whittle and Whitcher estimators. Moreover, to assess the impact of volatility in the estimation methods, we assumed that the innovations are generated by univariate GARCH process.

It finds that resistance is shaped by the laboratory technicians' individualistic interactions with technology, the laboratory layout and the technicians' desire for personal task-related autonomy and individual responsibility rather than team-based accountability. However, although resistance is linked to an individualistic interpretation of work it is supported by collective collusion. The article also finds that resistance is not necessarily anti-work. It is simultaneously oriented towards the interests of the company and individual technicians through the technicians' desire to perform their job well.

Two recently proposed frameworks, the missing link hypothesis and the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, describe a mechanism of the relationship between knowledge creation and regional economic performance through entrepreneurs. This study empirically tests these frameworks using the data on professional, scientific, and technical services in U.S. metropolitan areas from 2001 to 2005. The results indicate an intervening role of entrepreneurs in the relationship between patenting activity and job-creating behavior of incumbent companies, thus lending partial support to the missing link hypothesis. The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship is not supported, as greater local knowledge generation does not translate into increased firm formation.","[Tsvetkova, Alexandra] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Tsvetkova, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 331 Agr Adm Bldg,2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",tsvetkova.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,52,40,44,0,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We use the English wheat market, 1750-1914, as an example to quantify this issue. First, we show that bushel weight approximates grain quality. Then we show that cross sectional and intra-year variation are substantial and problematic, generating erroneous inference regarding market integration. Long run variation is significant, due to sharply declining international quality differentials, and this impacts estimated cost of living changes. By contrast, inter-year variation is smaller and controlled for more easily. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that the average income from agritourism accounted for about one-third of the overall household income of farmers. Moreover, food service is an important factor in the success of agritourism as it brings extra money to farmers.

The analysis registers a salient discrepancy between the extremely low levels of territorial homogeneity of the vote in the single-member plurality section of Russia's electoral system (1993-2003), on the one hand, and very high levels of party nationalization in party-list contests, on the other. This discrepancy, facilitated by such factors as the legacies of regime transition, federalism, and presidentialism, was reinforced by the integration of gubernatorial political machines into the nationwide political order, which ultimately resulted in unprecedentedly high levels of party nationalization in the 2007-2011 elections. The findings challenge a conventional theory that equates the formation of national electorates to the progressive process of party system consolidation, suggesting that under certain conditions, related but not reducible to the authoritarian perversion of the structure of electoral incentives, there is no such linear relationship.","European Univ St Petersburg, Polit Sci & Sociol Dept, St Petersburg, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg,"Golosov, GV (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Polit Sci & Sociol Dept, St Petersburg, Russia.",ggolosov@gmail.com,"Golosov, Grigorii/C-3032-2012","Golosov, Grigorii/0000-0001-9769-9230",,,,,66,10,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Many classic voting rules are defined or can be represented in this way. In this paper, we focus on the power and the limitations of the distance rationalizability approach. Lerer and Nitzan (J Econ Theory 37(1):191-201, 1985) and Campbell and Nitzan (Soc Choice Welf 3(1):1-16, 1986) show that if we do not place any restrictions on the notions of distance and consensus then essentially all voting rules can be distance-rationalized. We identify a natural class of distances on elections-votewise distances-which depend on the submitted votes in a simple and transparent manner, and investigate which voting rules can be rationalized via distances of this type. We also study axiomatic properties of rules that can be defined via votewise distances.","[Elkind, Edith] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England; [Faliszewski, Piotr] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland; [Slinko, Arkadii] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Oxford; AGH University of Krakow; University of Auckland,"Elkind, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England.",elkind@cs.ox.ac.uk,,"Slinko, Arkadii/0000-0002-0397-6290; Faliszewski, Piotr/0000-0002-0332-4364",,,,,48,25,26,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2015,45.0,2,,,,,345,377,,10.1007/s00355-015-0892-5,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CR7QB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361544400006,0

Are areas with a high price relative to an imputed rent paying for higher appreciation? In an efficient market (e.g., Gordon Growth Model), as fundamentals (impute rent) differ across locations and change over time, anticipation of these should generate a positive correlation between (residual) price levels and subsequent price changes. We undertake these tests in four different MSAs using a panel of repeat-sale house price indices that have been scaled to price levels with the hedonic attributes of the house and ZIP code. In three markets we find that identical houses in higher priced ZIP codes subsequently appreciate faster.

Utilizing a pseudo-repeat sale approach in a short sample period that includes 6 months before and after this exogenous shock, we mitigate the omitted variables problem, a common limitation in existing subway capitalization studies. We estimate the incremental effect of subway capitalization, and infer a 1.8 to 2.7 percentage point increase in people's willingness to pay for subway proximity, which is roughly 36% to 60% of the initial price premium for subway proximity. This increase is mainly due to the change in transportation mode following the driving restriction policy. We also find that the increase in demand for subway proximity exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity. Locations where subway travel time can better match that of car travel experience relatively higher housing price appreciation. Moreover, we find evidence that the increase in subway premium persists overtime. Our estimation provides a basis for a sound cost benefit analysis regarding how much and where the government should increase the supply of subway services after imposing restrictions on private driving.

Using high school prospect rankings, we show ex ante estimates of elite quarterback expected MRP are substantially lower, roughly US$400,000, and have limited statistical significance with respect to winning or revenue. Our ex ante measurements suggest that expected player value may be closer to the value of scholarships than previous research suggests due to the difficulty in predicting which high school quarterbacks will excel in college.","[Hunsberger, Peter K.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Gitter, Seth R.] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Gitter, SR (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",sgitter@towson.edu,,,NAASE,NAASE,"The authors would like to thank Kevin Chamberlain for assistance with gathering the data for the project as well as Brandon Augustino, Scott Davis, and Samantha Romero-Duenas for their research assistance.

For the aim of predicting annual data, one may consider temporal aggregation into larger subannual units based on an activity timescale instead of calendar time. Such a scheme may strike a balance between annual modeling (which processes little information) and modeling at the finest available frequency (which may lead to an excessive parameter dimension), and it may also outperform modeling calendar time units (with some months or quarters containing more information than others). We suggest an algorithm that performs an approximate inversion of the inherent seasonal time deformation.

However, most empirical experiments of foreign direct investment (FDI) determinants have been confined to general characteristics of host countries and multinational enterprises' outward investment activities. This may not clearly characterise the specific characteristics of inward FDI in regard to the host country. Thus, we introduce an alternative approach to clarify modes of FDI by investigating the link between patterns of trade and inward FDI. To empirically test whether our approach is applicable, we choose China during the period 1998-2007. We construct a modified gravity equation of bilateral trade while considering spatially lagged interdependence between host, home and third countries. The problem of endogeneity is controlled by applying the system generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation technique. Our findings are consistent with results in existing studies on modes of outward FDI to China and prove that our approach in dealing with the link between patterns of trade and inward FDI has wide applicability to all modes of FDI. We discover there is strong evidence for statistically significant complementarity between bilateral trade and inward FDI within the aggregate trade data. As we decompose the aggregate trade data into final and intermediate goods, we find the motivation concerning export-platform and complex vertical FDI is very significant. In addition, as we separate the bilateral partners into developing partners and developed partners, we find both bilateral and multilateral linkages are much stronger with developing partners.","[Park, Innwon] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Korea University; Kongju National University,"Park, I (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907; Park, Soonchan/0000-0001-8389-852X",Graduate School of International Studies at Korea University; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2054749],Graduate School of International Studies at Korea University; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the third GEP Conference in China on Enterprise and Labour Market Adjustment in China's Transition organised by Leverhulme Centre for Research on Globalisation and Economic Policy (GEP) at the University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China, 9-10 November 2010.

In recent years, tourism supply has changed considerably and rural tourism has been growing rapidly.

This paper empirically investigates the determinants of the international demand for agritourism in Italy. It shows the luxury nature of rural tourism and demonstrates that international flows are demand-driven. To the extent that entrepreneurs and policy makers wish to encourage rural tourism, subsidies, policy interventions and marketing campaigns may differ substantially according to the foreign countries targeted.

Earlier studies have developed various methods to estimate PCE values but only a few of them are based on uninterrupted traffic flow, particularly for flow regimes with heterogeneous traffic where differential (lower) speed limits are imposed on commercial vehicles. This paper proposes a lane-harmonisation approach, which leverages on the high variation in traffic composition across the lanes, to estimate PCE factors for urban expressways. Multiple linear regression is used and the PCE factors obtained for motorcycles, light goods vehicles, and heavy goods vehicles are 0.65, 1.53, and 2.75, respectively. The estimated capacity flow rate after the application of the obtained PCE factors is around 2200 PCUs per hour per lane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis uses a census of French exports by firm-destination-product over the period 1994-2008 with a monthly frequency. We first uncover a large calendar year effect associated with the timing of entry: the fact new exporters may start exporting late during the year inflates the growth rate between the first and second years. When computed on a full year basis starting with the month of entry, first year exports of new exporters are on average 36per cent larger than on a calendar year basis. We then show that, controlling for size, export experience is negatively related to net growth of exports for surviving exporters. Controlling for export experience, the relationship between average size and net growth of exports shows no systematic pattern. Finally, churning in foreign markets, that is the gross contributions of entry and exit to exporters net growth, is decreasing with export experience and (sharply) with size.","[Berthou, Antoine; Vicard, Vincent] Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Berthou, A (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,"Vicard, Vincent/0000-0003-2847-1456",,,,,28,22,23,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2015,38.0,7,,,SI,,1130,1158,,10.1111/twec.12221,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CM8YK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357989600006,0

However, the limited electric range of PEVs could impede their market introduction. Still some potential users are willing to pay more for PEVs. The combined effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are unclear. Here, we study the market evolution of PEVs in Germany until 2020. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of PEVs due to external conditions and the users' willingness to pay. We find the future share of PEVs in German passenger car stock to range from 0.4% to almost 3% by 2020. Energy prices have a large impact on PEV market evolution as a 25% increase in fuel prices would double the number of PEVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a special depreciation allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1000 Euro as the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. The high uncertainty of the market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of PEVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

If the panel periods are volatile or long, however, the model parameters can change much. Hence this paper generalizes PCLE with time-constant parameters to PCLE with time-varying parameters; both static and dynamic PCLE are considered for this. The main finding is that time-varying parameters are fully allowed for static PCLE and the dynamic pseudo PCLE of [Bartolucci, F. and V. Nigro. 2010.

As a further generalization, static panel conditional multinomial logit estimator (PML) with time-varying parameters is also examined. As it turns out, time-varying parameters are also fully allowed for PML. With no error term serial correlation allowed in PCLE and dynamic PCLE's being restrictive in their assumptions, time-varying parameters provide an alternative avenue to inject dynamics and flexibility into PCLE and PML. Since PCLE and PML converge straightforwardly in computation, allowing time-varying parameters in PCLE and PML is computationally free.

However, in the long run stakeholders aim for profit maximisation and it has been shown for other parts of the aviation supply chain that quality does significantly impact on profitability. In this paper we aim to investigate whether perceived airport quality has an impact on airport profit margins. We further apply two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models to estimate a single efficiency measure that combines the potentially conflicting indicators of perceived service quality and profitability for the airport context. We also identify determinants of the jointly estimated single quality/profitability measure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We reformulate a general scheduling model employing rank-dependent utility theory and derive two special cases as econometric specifications to study these uncaptured costs. It is found that reduced-form expected cost functions still have a mean-variance form when misperception is considered, but the value of travel time variability is higher. We estimate these two models with stated-preference data and calculate the empirical cost of misperception. We find that: (i) travelers are mostly pessimistic and thus tend to choose departure times too early to achieve a minimum cost, (ii) scheduling preferences elicited using a stated-choice method can be relatively biased if probability weighting is not considered, and (iii) the extra cost of misperceiving the travel time distribution might be nontrivial when time is valued differently over the time of day and is substantial for some people.

How steering cultures in local authorities affect implementation of integrated public transport and land-use planning,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Integrated planning; Policy integration; Land use; Public transport; Sustainable mobility,GOVERNANCE; POLICY,"Previous research has shown integrated planning to be important for achieving aims concerning more environmentally friendly transport operations, but less good at explaining prerequisites of implementation. This paper analyses how management and working practises in local authorities, here understood as steering cultures, affect implementation of integrated land-use and public transport planning approaches. The analysis builds on case studies of planning in two Swedish municipalities. These have developed two antithetical steering cultures, namely one that can be described as deliberative and one that can be described as sectorised. The paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of these steering cultures. The findings show the deliberative model to facilitate integration through advanced mechanisms of consensus and co-ordination between policy-makers and officials. The sectorised model has no such mechanisms, but this need not result in poor prospects of integrated planning. It is important for integrated planning approaches, whatever the steering culture, to be in line with the institutionalised norms and objectives by which planning practices are governed. Integration therefore needs a normative component, so as to ensure implementation. The important normative component in this context can be construed as discourses and rationales concerning transport and the urban development of which public transport forms part.

Three alternatives were analyzed. User fee rates were estimated for either a national or regional tonnage based fee. Our results indicate that maintenance cost recovering regional fees could vary widely from about 10 cents per tonne to nearly 80 cents per tonne. A national rate would be about 30 cents per tonne. The large regional differences and affects on bulk shippers are likely to make implementing and maintaining cost recovering tonnage based fees infeasible. Two other mechanisms are considered. One possibility is to abolish the HMT without a replacement mechanism. The obvious strength of this approach is its simplicity, the weaknesses is that it is not budget neutral. Another possibility is to increase the federal diesel tax rate. One strength of the approach is the reasonable rate increase required to recover port maintenance costs (estimated between 0.278 and 0.315 cents per liter). An additional strength is that relatively inefficient fuel users will either make the largest share of the additional payments or the freight will shift modes to one that is more efficient. One weakness is that the rate has been unchanged since 1997, this points to the political difficulty involved in passing such a rate increase. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Even though the visitors' preferences were different, it was possible to segment them into three groups based on the results. The first segment clearly preferred a wildlife observation tour and considered the possibility of finding rare eagles and detailed interpretation highly important. At the other extreme, the second segment preferred an adventure-based drift ice tour and were not interested in eagles or detailed interpretation. The final segment comprised those visitors whose preferences were between these two extremes. The findings show that, for satisfactory and profitable tours, tourist agents should provide specific recreation experiences to cater to these heterogeneous preferences rather than experiences thought to be acceptable to all visitors.","[Shoji, Yasushi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Tsuge, Takahiro] Konan Univ, Fac Econ, Higashinada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6588501, Japan",Hokkaido University; Konan University,"Shoji, Y (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",yshoji@for.agr.hokudai.ac.jp; tsuge@center.konan-u.ac.jp,"Shoji, Yasushi/ABC-9052-2021; Shoji, Yasushi/B-7756-2012","Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890; Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16730131]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16730131] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to acknowledge the kind support for the implementation of the survey from the local council promoting ecotourism in Shiretoko, Hokkaido, Japan.

Assuming that every traveler sets a mental account for his/her travel to keep track of their expense and keep out-of-pocket spending under control, it addresses these questions such that How much money can I spend on the travel? and What if I spend too much?. Route tolls that exceed the budget are much more unacceptable compared to those within budget due to the non-fungibility of money between different accounts. A simple network with two nodes and two routes is analyzed firstly, the analytical solutions are obtained and the optimal road tolls supporting the user equilibrium as a system optimum are also derived. The proposed model is then extended to a generalized network. The multiclass user equilibrium conditions with travel mental budgeting are formulated into an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem and an equivalent minimization problem. Through analyses with numerical examples, it is found that the main reason that the usages of high tolled roads are often overestimated is due to the fact that travelers with low and moderate out-of-pocket travel budget perceive a much higher travel cost than their actual cost on the high tolled roads.

Using a panel time series approach and a large cross-country dataset, the paper estimates a long-run aggregate production function relating gross domestic product to human capital, physical capital, and a synthetic measure of infrastructure comprising transport, power and telecommunications. Tests of the cointegration rank allowing it to vary across countries reveal a common rank with a single cointegrating vector, which we interpret as the long-run production function. Estimation of its parameters is performed using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, which allows for unrestricted short-run parameter heterogeneity across countries while imposing the (testable) restriction of long-run parameter homogeneity. The long-run elasticity of output with respect to the synthetic infrastructure index ranges between 0.07 and 0.10. The estimates are highly significant, both statistically and economically, and robust to alternative dynamic specifications and infrastructure measures. Tests of parameter homogeneity fail to yield evidence that the long-run parameters differ across countries.

HF-based covariance matrix predictions are obtained by applying a blocked realized kernel estimator, different smoothing windows, various regularization methods and two forecasting models. We show that HF-based predictions yield a significantly lower portfolio volatility than methods employing daily returns.

In this context, scoring rules are well-known procedures to aggregate the preferences of the voters. Under these rules, each candidate obtains a fixed number of points, , each time he/she is ranked th by one voter and the candidates are ordered according to the total number of points they receive. In order to identify the best scoring rule to use in each situation, we need to know which properties are met by each of these procedures. Although some properties have been analyzed extensively, there are other properties that have not been studied for all scoring rules. In this paper, we consider two desirable social choice properties, the Pareto-optimality and the immunity to the absolute loser paradox, and establish characterizations of the scoring rules that satisfy each of these specific axioms. Moreover, we also provide a proof of a result given by Saari and Barney (The Mathematical Intelligencer 25:17-31, 2003), where the scoring rules meeting reversal symmetry are characterized. From the results of characterization, we establish some relationships among these properties. Finally, we give a characterization of the scoring rules satisfying the three properties.","[Llamazares, Bonifacio; Pena, Teresa] Univ Valladolid, Inst Matemat IMUVA, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Llamazares, B (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Inst Matemat IMUVA, Dept Econ Aplicada, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",boni@eco.uva.es; maitepe@eco.uva.es,"Peña, Teresa/K-8652-2019; Llamazares, Bonifacio/A-2526-2013; Pena, Teresa/H-5637-2015","Llamazares, Bonifacio/0000-0002-7538-4833; Pena, Teresa/0000-0003-4594-7225",,,,,22,14,14,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2015,78.0,3,,,,,429,450,,10.1007/s11238-014-9429-0,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB0ON,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349326000006,0

At first, we derive analytical expressions for transaction probabilities of ZI pairs in the SB, as well as the three expected outcomes. Those are the allocative efficiency (AE), the average trading price, and the trading volume. Then, we conduct simulations by transferring the identical supply and demand functions from the SB to the CDA because of the complexity of its period. They produce similar statistical results as in the SB although the AE in the CDA is a little higher than that in the SB, while the trading volume is a little smaller than that in the SB. Statistical properties still hold for special shapes that make the long-run outcomes of CDA and the expected outcomes of SB deviate a lot from their corresponding competitive equilibriums. It is concluded that transaction probabilities or frequencies of ZI pairs help to explain how the principle of statistics determines both expected outcomes of a SB and long-run outcomes of a CDA populated by ZI agents.","[Yang, Jie] Wuhan Text Univ, Coll Accounting, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Wenjie] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Wuhan Textile University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhan, WJ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",jyang77@163.com; wjzhan@mail.hust.edu.cn,,,"NSFC [70871045]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) [10YJC630329]; SRF for ROCS, SEM","NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China)(Ministry of Education, China); SRF for ROCS, SEM(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","We thank the three anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

Was the empire a blessing or a drag to the economy? Using an estimated dynamic model, we conclude that intercontinental trade had a substantial and increasingly positive impact on economic growth. In the heyday of colonial expansion, eliminating the economic links to empire would have reduced Portugal's per capita income by at least a fifth. While the empire helped the domestic economy, it was not sufficient to annul the tendency of the latter toward decline in relation to Europe's advanced core, which began to set in from the seventeenth century onward, but only became definite after 1800.

An econometric methodology consisting of an autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to co-integration is used. For Costa Rica, agricultural and manufacturing (not statistically significant) and tourism development are negatively related to indigence poverty with estimated elasticity values of -0.50 for agriculture, -0.17 for manufacturing and -0.58 for tourism. For Nicaragua, the estimated elasticity values are -0.40 for agriculture, -0.13 for manufacturing (not statistically significant) and -0.64 for tourism. Tourism's rate of poverty reduction was statistically significantly greater than that of agriculture for both countries. The main contribution of this paper lies in the understanding of sector contributions to alleviating poverty. The methods utilized can be undertaken by most countries in the world, thereby providing insights into developing targeted investment policies and strategies to achieve higher rates of poverty reduction.","[Vanegas, Manuel, Sr.; Gartner, William; Senauer, Benjamin] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Gartner, W (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",vaneg001@umn.edu; wcg@umn.edu; bsenauer@umn.edu,,,"Center for Food and International Agriculture Policy (CIFAP), University of Minnesota","Center for Food and International Agriculture Policy (CIFAP), University of Minnesota","We thank the Center for Food and International Agriculture Policy (CIFAP), University of Minnesota for providing partial financial funding in support of implementing this study.

The main purpose of the research was to define the indicators for measuring countries investment to technologies. Research was based on systematic and comparative scientific literature analysis and statistical data analysis. The indicators of 28 European Union countries from World well-known databases during 10 years period were analysed. Factor analysis was performed in order to assign each indicator to different subgroups according to the subject it represents. The set of investment to technologies indicators were defined and classified to the three main dimensions: technology system, business enterprises activities and technological achievement. The defined set of indicators will contribute in further investigation of countries investment to technologies. Research results lead to measure countries investment to technologies and to compare it between different countries and different time periods that could show countries position and progress while investing to technologies.","[Adlyte, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Adlyte, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,379,385,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400048,0

This article wishes to outline the profile of students from Spain who travel, by pointing out elements such as: the desire to travel, their experience and behavior as tourists, the main cities they visited during their studies and means of transportation they use for travelling. Outlining this profile is useful to many entities in this field, such as: travel agencies, transport companies, accommodation units and other related units, by helping them to adapt their offers to the actual needs of this segment of tourists. A total of 207 students from the University of Lleida in Spain were included in this study, with the average age of 21.5 years. The data were collected between January and March 2015 and were processed in SPSS. The results obtained from data processing showed that 99.5% of students included in the study like to travel, asking for details and free materials from the tourist information points in 43% of cases, and out of these, 75.9% intend to travel to a foreign country in the near future.

However, existing research provides no consensus agreement on the actual definition of time-on-market and its calculation. Very little discussion of the numerous reasonable alternative definitions exists. To address this ambiguity, alternative definitions and related calculations of time-on-market are assessed. First, using multiple listing service data from a medium-sized United States city, five measures of time-on-market are modeled and across-model differences are evaluated. Second, using multiple listing service data from a large United States city, the importance of relisted properties in defining and assessing time-on-market is investigated. Results indicate that both time-on-market definition and the handling of relisted properties substantially influence model outcomes and the statistical significance of dependent variables. Results also suggest that much of the existing literature incorporating time-on-market warrants reevaluation using a consistent definition of marketing time and an adjustment for relisted properties.","[Benefield, Justin D.] Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Raymond J Harbert Coll Business, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hardin, William G., III] Florida Int Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Coll Business Adm, Miami, FL 33199 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Benefield, JD (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Raymond J Harbert Coll Business, 405 W Magnolia Ave,Suite 303, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",justin_benefield@auburn.edu; hardinw@fiu.edu,,,,,,,34,16,20,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It posits that globalisation encourages fragmentation and dislocation of the senses by emphasising the visual bias through disembodied structures and communication. In a globalised economy guided by free market principles, it is the systems that matter rather than the individuals using the systems. The visual bias reinforces this favouring of the systemic and programmed over the holistic and organic. The creative work proposed here attempts to address this imbalance by creating zones of intensity in and around areas of work. These areas of artistic production/installation/performance would operate on the informal level of cultural transmission, as set out by Edward T. Hall in his theory of culture, where cultural knowledge and assimilation happen on three distinct but porous levels that can influence each other: the informal, the formal, and the technical. Zone of intensity is a term coined by Russell West-Pavlov and deployed by Darko Radovic to address the visual bias of urban planning. By researching spaces through the artistic inquiry of derive from the Situationists and encouraging modes of recording those investigations through artistic forms such as drawing and poetry, Radovic champions the importance of the subjective in expressing the meaning of spaces. This notion is a key focus point of the work presented here to give equal weight and importance to the qualitative (experience) as that of the quantitative (data) in designing spaces, assigning function to those spaces, and creating the organisational structures for people to live and work in those spaces.","Univ Arts London Elephant & Castle, Sch Design, London Coll Commun, London, England",University of Arts London,"Biagioli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Arts London Elephant & Castle, Sch Design, London Coll Commun, London, England.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1328,1337,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200102,0

This implies not only responding to customer's requests, but also striving to anticipate, recognize and meet customer needs and expectations. In order to obtain these objectives, structures, systems and people have to act simultaneously by creating a corporate culture focused on service orientation. This paper aims to explore the service orientation culture (SOC) construct and how managers develop it within their hotels by highlighting possible cultural differences. Design/methodology/approach - We propose a qualitative approach conducted by means of in-depth interviews to luxury hotels managers belonging to different countries. Originality/value - The findings emphasize the close relationship between customer and service orientation. In the luxury hotels considered in the study these concepts are inseparable because delivering successfully services to guests requires to meet, remember and anticipate their needs and expectations. This work also highlights the usefulness of videos and vignette to help hotel staff to remind how it needs to behave during some situations. Further, the propensity to SOC should vary according to the variety of target customers. Practical implications - The results suggest to hotel managers to develop SOC by investing in the creation of a service-oriented corporate culture (including corporate values, brand values, customer focus culture, traditions of national hospitality culture, golden rules), its communication within the hotel, as well as related employees' training.","[Bonfanti, Angelo; Vigolo, Vania] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Magliocca, Pierpaolo] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",University of Verona; University of Foggia,"Bonfanti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",,"Vigolo, Vania/A-3907-2013",,,,,,38,0,0,0,14,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,403,413,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200031,0

His later monograph on the topic, Zur Theorie des Kapitals (A contribution to the theory of capital), is more or less ignored, although it must be seen as a recantation of his earlier views. As it becomes clear in this work, Menger would have opposed all attempts to define capital as a heterogeneous structure of higher-order goods - a definition that is associated with his name today. In his opinion capital is a homogeneous concept stemming from accounting practices. The debate about Menger's view on capital does not only concern terminological points, but involves the subject matter of capital theory. A theory of capital based on Menger's later view would concentrate on the way the market economy is organized and not on technical characteristics of a multi-stage production process.","Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",TU Clausthal,"Braun, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",eduard.braun@tu-dausthal.de,,,,,,,61,14,14,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It is shown that tax revenue forecasts for the medium-term are upward biased. Overoptimistic revenue projections are particularly pronounced after the German reunification and reflect upward-biased GDP projections in this period. The predicted tax-GDP-ratio appears to be upward biased, as well. The forecasts are likely to overestimate tax revenues if the predicted tax-GDP-ratio exceeds its structural level of approximately 221/2 percentage points. The results also indicate that forecast errors of short-term projections for the current year exhibit serial correlation. It is conceivable that the non-rational behaviour can be traced back to the specific institutional setting of revenue forecasting and budgetary planning in Germany.","Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Breuer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",breuer@ifo.de,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Political Literacy and the Construction of National History,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; IDENTITY; ENGLAND; SCHOOL,"Despite the reflexive nature of historical enquiry and the degree of national interconnectness now theorized by historians in the United Kingdom, education debates over history teaching in Britain often yield a comforting defence of Britain's island story'. The singular island story' is an economical narrative device favoured by politicians and further mediated through newspapers which profit from such national cryogenics. Maintenance of a currency, or crisis, of Britishness can also be contrasted with the relative absence of longitudinal or comparative enquiry into identity and school curricula. In addition, the teaching of states, connections and post-sovereign communities is largely under-theorized, potentially contributing to the sterility of future debates about citizenship, agency and Britain's wider political reach. It is argued here that the public framing of history as nationhood and the underdevelopment of children's political literacy are mutually reinforcing conditions by which the state has constructed a stabilizing, yet shifting presence of the national'.

Also, it should take into account the inevitable imprecision deriving from the necessity of representing complex phenomena in feasible ways. The purpose of our work is to define an abstract model for representing both users and resources with the main features of generality, adaptivity and capability of handling imprecise information. This model is called Fuzzy Information Filter (FIF). Design/methodology/approach - A FIF is based on the homogeneous description of users and resources in terms of fuzzy metadata, i.e. attributes whose values are defined in terms of fuzzy sets. Metadata define elementary filters, which can be combined in order to define composite filters that could better represent complex profiles. Furthermore, both elementary and composite filters can be adapted to incoming data by means of learning rules based on Possibility Theory, eventually relaxed to comply with specific application needs. Originality/value - The adoption of metadata to represent resources in an homogeneous way makes possible the use of the proposed model within semantic web applications. The use of fuzzy sets to define metadata enables imprecise assignment of values to attributes coming from subjective judgments, perception-based knowledge, etc. When a resource is given, the application of a FIF assesses how much the resource is compatible with the information stored in the filter. The resulting degree can be used to rank resources, e.g. with respect to the interests of a user. This approach could be exploited to attenuate the problem of information overload in large repositories of resources. Furthermore, the technology of fuzzy sets makes FIF models intelligible to analysts and inclined to integration with expert knowledge. Finally, the possibility of automatically adapting filters using incoming data enables the realization of personalized and adaptive systems. Practical implications - FIF models can be applied to represent user profiles in personalized applications where the use of fuzzy sets is a competitive advantage, as in personalized e-learning systems, recommendation systems, etc. More advanced applications could profit of the peculiar representation of profiles in terms of complex filters to produce, for example, clusters of people with a similar profile. On the overall, FIF introduces flexibility and adaptivity in web-based applications that use social networks and resources to expose intelligent behaviors.","[Castellano, Giovanna; Castiello, Ciro; Fanelli, Anna Maria; Lucarelli, Marco; Mencar, Corrado] Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Informat, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Mencar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Informat, Via E Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",,"Mencar, Corrado/X-9197-2019","Mencar, Corrado/0000-0001-8712-023X",,,,,13,0,0,1,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,941,954,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200071,0

The article begins by delineating five phases in the evolution of the outsider tradition back to 1815 through a survey of the relevant historiography. The article then examines how prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron have looked to various inflections of the outsider tradition to inform their European discourses. The focus in the speech data sections is on British identity, history and the realist appreciation of international politics that informed the leaders' suggestions for EEC/EU reform. The central argument is that historically informed narratives such as those making up the outsider tradition do not determine opinion-formers' outlooks, but that they can be deeply impervious to rapid change. We can therefore understand why Britain has come to hover near the EU exit door because British leaders have consistently drawn upon outsider' narratives as the organizing frame for their European policy discourses.

Our objective was to identify new opportunities for protecting the environment in these areas by emphasizing the potential of cultivation of more resistant plants. With these aim in mind we conducted in 2013 two experiments of growing wax gourd, a plant specific to lowland tropical land. Our experiments (E3 and E4) came to complete the researches regarding this plant performed in 1960 (E1 and E2). We analyse these experiments in a comparative manner to present in this way the behaviour of plant in four types of cultivation: greenhouse; hotbed; open field - direct sowing; open field - planting seedlings. The results revealed a high yields potential (until 80 tons per hectare) and an improvement in soil composition which was enriched with nutritive substances, especially potassium and phosphorus. In this way, the wax gourd can be described like a very good plant for environment protection and also a plant with a high productivity. The results obtained permitted us to recommend the introduction of this plant in Romanian flora in areas with low alkaline reaction (pH over 7), high temperatures during summer (over 30 degrees C) and low level of precipitations (under 225 l/m(2) in June-September period).

The input of service employees into the innovation process is perceived inconsistently in the literature, reflecting a lack of theoretical uniformity to determine employee-driven service innovation. An emerging line of research, however, focused on employees' role in service encounter-based innovation (i.e. Toivonen and Tuominen, 2009; Sundbo and Toivonen, 2011); the service encounter-based innovation conception was originally derived from the user-driven innovation theme in the innovation management literature and emerged as a contemporary research line in the service innovation literature. Service encounter-based innovation denotes service innovation as developing from ideas, knowledge or practices derived from frontline service employees' meetings with users during the service delivery process (Sorensen and Jensen, 2012). Respectively, this paper intends to investigate further the role of employees in initiating service encounter-based innovation through the lens of innovative behaviour proposition. By doing so, this paper also aims to compare and contrast the research findings with the theoretical framework of (Sorensen et al., 2013) that determined an integrative relationship between practice-based and management directed innovation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative case-study research strategy, which compared between two case studies of personal-interactive service companies, was applied to achieve the objectives of the study. The application of qualitative case-study research allowed closer assessment and observation while the researcher was directly present within the service delivery environment. The combining of qualitative research methods, such as semi-structured interviews, review of archival records and direct observation, was applied to congregate evidence of employees' innovative behaviour patterns from multiple perspectives. Originality/value - This paper adds further insight by verifying the nature of service employees' innovative behaviour and its contribution in initiating service innovation. The findings also identify the influence of contextual determinants in nurturing or inhibiting service employees' innovative behaviour. Practical implications - Practical implications and recommendations for management to nurture service employees' innovative behaviour are presented based on the study findings. The practical recommendations provide managers working within personal-interactive service companies with sensible measures to nurture innovative behaviour among employees.","Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University,"Edghiem, F (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Redmonds Bldg,Clarence St, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England.",,,,,,,,92,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,722,754,,,,,,33,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200056,0

Although the importance of business model innovation affects all the economic activities, this is particularly true for some industries more involved to face the acceleration of the pace of change, the relevance of value networking, the greater availability of knowledge, the increasing growth and role of new competitive players: it is the case of the technology-intensive industries. In fact, in the last decade, in business scenario changing and under an high competitive pressure, technology-intensive organizations are revisiting and expanding their traditional borders and modalities to do business, trying to re-think their value propositions and to integrate more effectively new products and services, customers segmentation, places and channels, partnerships, competences and cost-reduction needs.

The heaviest insecticide treatments occur in the San Joaquin Valley where extremes of heat and cold reduce the efficacy of natural enemies. In the San Joaquin Valley, citrus thrips Scirtothrips citri (Moulton) and California red scale Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) have been primary pests for many decades. Forktailed bush katydid Scudderia furcata Brunner von Wattenwyl and citricola scale Coccus pseudomagnoliarum (Kuwana) became primary pests when selective insecticides replaced organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. San Joaquin Valley growers maintain their integrated pest management (IPM) program by utilizing low rates of pyrethroids or organophosphate insecticides for katydids and applying organophosphates for citricola scale in alternate years - resulting in an average of 3-4 treatments for all pests per year. In 2008, the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama was discovered and in 2012 huanglongbing disease was found in California. While the majority of find sites of the psyllid have been in residential areas of the state, it is expected that the pest and disease will become established in commercial citrus in the near future. Because the disease is difficult to detect when trees first become infected and there is no cure for the disease, psyllid population reduction in combination with infected tree removal is currently the most effective strategy for preventing disease spread. Because the most effective treatments for Asian citrus psyllid are broad spectrum in nature, California citrus IPM will experience major disruptions in the near future. There will be regional differences in the risk of pest and disease establishment and in the impact of treatments on the IPM program.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Grafton-Cardwell, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",eegraftoncardwell@ucanr.edu,,,,,,,28,6,7,0,14,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1083,1090,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.136,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600136,0

The desire for more effective and efficient delivery of these services transformed them from local to area-wide (AW) supply of clean water and the collection of the garbage and disposal of sewage. Today, AW services (e.g. electricity, mail service, fire protection, public health, high-speed transport, telephone, internet services, etc.) are widespread. Applied to insect pests, AW strategies have their ancient roots in coping with vector-borne diseases and locust plagues. They focus on the preventive management of major mobile pest populations throughout the ecosystem, treating all habitats of the pest population to avoid large sources of migrants to re-establish significant infestations in areas of concern. In contrast, the conventional strategy focuses narrowly on defending the valued entity (crop, livestock, people, buildings, etc.) from direct attack by pests. This reactive approach only became possible with the advent of effective modern insecticides, allowing the localized action involving minimal forward planning and independent implementation, without coordination by individual producers, businesses or households. On the other hand AW management requires coordination, multiyear planning and an organization dedicated exclusively to its implementation. For several decades integrated pest management (IPM) and AW pest control were seen as competing paradigms with different objectives and approaches. Yet, the two schools have gradually converged. AW-IPM is increasingly accepted for mobile pests, such as fruit flies that are key pests of citrus and other fruit and vegetable crops, where management at a larger scale is more effective, environmentally friendly and preferable to the uncoordinated field-by-field approach.","[Hendrichs, Jorge] Joint Food & Agr Org FAO, A-1400 Vienna, Austria; Int Atom Energy Agcy IAEA, Insect Pest Control Sect, Div Nucl Tech Food & Agr, A-1400 Vienna, Austria",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); International Atomic Energy Agency,"Hendrichs, J (通讯作者)，Joint Food & Agr Org FAO, Wagramerstr 5, A-1400 Vienna, Austria.",j.hendrichs@iaea.org,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,22,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,67,72,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600006,0

To achieve this, quails were divided into two equal groups (250 heads/lot), the control group was maintained on a 24-hour lighting period and experimental group was maintained in a program with discontinuous illumination, using natural lighting completed with artificial light with a variable duration (12 hours and 30 minutes during the first 6 months of laying curve, 14 hours and 10 minutes in the following). To complete the study on the battery cage effect temperature was recorded on each level in both groups. During the period studied, the results were significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the controls ones. The average production performance regarding the percentage of laying was higher by 10.21% and egg production per capita was higher by 21.92%. Average consumption of mixed feed was 4.33% higher in the experimental group, while specific consumption was 25.51% higher in the control group quail. Average mortality was 10.60% lower in the experimental quails group. In conclusion, the use of a discontinuous lighting with variable duration program depending on the laying curve (lower in the first part of the lay curve and higher in the second part of it) is recommended. The influence of the cages battery was insignificant, but should be considered that temperature fluctuations in the 5 levels were not higher than 4 Celsius degrees in both groups.

Information sharing between buyers and sellers is possible in negotiations but not in reverse auctions. This is one of the reasons why reverse auctions yield better results for the buyers. In auctions the sellers observe other sellers' bids but they cannot contact the buyer. In contrast, in negotiations the sellers cannot observe the other sellers' offers but they can expect to get information from the buyers. This suggests, that in order to make negotiations more efficient and yielding better results for the buyers, the buyers should make verifiable disclosure of the offers they obtain from the sellers. The results of the experiments showed, however, that the buyers' outcomes were significantly worse when the best offer was disclosed in verifiable but not in non-verifiable negotiations. The reverse was true for the sellers: they achieved significantly better outcomes in verifiable than in verifiable or in non-verifiable negotiations. This suggests that showing the best offer to all sellers reduces rather than increases competition among the sellers. An explanation of the differences between the two types of negotiations on economic grounds relies on information revelation. The participants who get relevant information should be able to make better decisions and reach more favourable outcomes than those who do not get this information. This implies that the sellers who participate in verifiable negotiations should achieve better contracts than those who participate in non-verifiable negotiations. This indeed, was the case, but there is also the question of competitive forces at play. It appears that the additional information weakens rather than strengthens the competition; that is, its role is opposite to its role in auctions. Moreover, for the buyers the results from verifiable negotiations are worse than from non-verifiable negotiations. Thus, if the buyers provide the competing sellers with important and reliable information, they are worse off than when they withhold this information. Another important observation is that the sellers who know the best offers during the negotiations are less satisfied than those who do not know them. This suggest that information disclosure works against the one who discloses it and makes those who obtain it less satisfied with the results they achieved. The paper discusses the experiments and provides explanation of the results grounded in social exchange theory. Purpose - (1) To study the impact of verifiable information on the multi-bilateral negotiations and their outcomes. (2) To explain the reasons for the sellers' lower satisfaction despite achieving better results in verifiable vs. non-verifiable multi-bilateral negotiations. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an experimental approach, in which groups of students participate in multi-bilateral negotiations. Collected process data and data obtained from two questionnaires is used to compare non-verifiable and verifiable multi-bilateral negotiations. Originality/value - This is, arguably, the first study on the role of information in multi-bilateral multi-attribute negotiations. It shows that social-psychological aspects affect the process and that new information may increase the impact of these aspects on the results. Practical implications - While more experiments need to be conducted the results of these experiments are applicable to market exchanges and transactions which involve government and business organizations. Multi-bilateral negotiations are more flexible than auctions and they allow for the consideration of multiple attributes in a dynamic way. This is one of the reason for using them instead of multi-attribute auctions. The social-psychological aspects and the role of information needs to be carefully considered. The results from our experiments suggest that in business negotiations disclosure of verifiable information may have unintended consequences. These results should be verified in other experiment and field studies both in commercial and non-commercial contexts.","Concordia Univ, J Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Kersten, G (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, J Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Kersten, Gregory/AAE-9142-2020","Kersten, Gregory/0000-0001-8045-1941",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2243,2252,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200176,0

One of the most frequent approach in FC is to define first the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) integral of fractional order, and then by means of suitable integer-order differentiation operation applied over it (or under its sign) a fractional derivative is defined - in the R-L sense (or in Caputo sense). The first mentioned (R-L type) is closer to the theoretical studies in analysis, but has some shortages - from the point of view of interpretation of the initial conditions for Cauchy problems for fractional differential equations (stated also by means of fractional order derivatives/integrals), and also for the analysts' confusion that such a derivative of a constant is not zero in general. The Caputo (C-) derivative, arising first in geophysical studies, helps to overcome these problems and to describe models of applied problems with physically consistent initial conditions. The operators of the Generalized Fractional Calculus - GFC (integrals and derivatives) are based on commuting m-tuple (m = 1, 2, 3, ...) compositions of operators of the classical FC with power weights (the so-called Erdelyi-Kober operators), but represented in compact and explicit form by means of integral, integro-differential (R-L type) or differential-integral (C-type) operators, where the kernels are special functions of most general hypergeometric kind. The foundations of this theory are given in Kiryakova [18]. In this survey we present the genesis of the definitions of the GFC - the generalized fractional integrals and derivatives (of fractional multi-order) of R-L type and Caputo type, analyze their properties and applications. Their special cases are all the known operators of classical FC, their generalizations introduced by other authors, the hyper-Bessel differential operators of higher integer order m as a multi-order (1, 1,..., 1), the Gelfond-Leontiev generalized differentiation operators, many other integral and differential operators in Calculus that have been used in various topics, some of them not related to FC at all, others involved in differential and integral equations for treating fractional order models.","[Kiryakova, Virginia] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Math & Informat, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Kiryakova, V (通讯作者)，Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Math & Informat, Acad G Bonchev Str,Block 8, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.",virginia@diogenes.bg,"Kiryakova, Virginia/G-7694-2015","Kiryakova, Virginia/0000-0002-4591-6958",,,,,38,1,1,0,7,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1337-5,AIP CONF PROC,,,2015,1690.0,,,,,,,,50007.0,10.1063/1.4936737,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Physics,BE0PS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366565600059,0

The primary aim of the article is to assess the extent to which defamilisation creates distinct welfare regimes across post-communist countries.

The need for such a blueprint is defined in the following way: What does the interaction between facts and feelings mean for managing customer value and profitability, and how such interaction can be established? Such a blueprint ought to be at least widely and emotionally desirable, ergonomic and effective, durable and repairable, which have not been sufficiently addressed as design characteristics in the MA literature. Design/methodology/approach - Besides a literature review on the processes of co-thinking and co-feeling in management accounting literature, we propose a more detailed approach for identifying the needs for accounting development and responding to them with a relation to the aforementioned challenges. In practice, we identify timely management challenges in different case environments, ranging from industrial operations to health care services. After that, we elaborate on the desired role of MA practice in responding to the identified challenges, as a basis for the proposed blueprint of new MA. Originality/value - The paper is among the rare attempts to extend the theory and practice of management accounting with an approach that combines both analytical and emotional aspects of value and profitability management. The paper provides both a description of the needs for accounting development in different environments and an aggregate level agenda for turning such blueprint into action, i.e., the blueprint of new MA. Moreover, the paper responds to the need for better supporting managerial work by means of accounting information, with an explicit connection to the processes of value and profitability management in the companies. Practical implications - The research gap underlying this paper is closely connected to the needs for developing management accounting practice according to the timely management challenges and recent technological advancements. After reading this paper, practitioners will be able to identify the needs for accounting development in their organizations, and translate the blueprint of new management accounting into a set of practical questions related to their own business context.","[Laine, Teemu; Suomala, Petri; Saukkonen, Natalia] Tampere Univ Technol, Cost Management Ctr, FI-33101 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Laine, T (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ Technol, Cost Management Ctr, POB 541, FI-33101 Tampere, Finland.",,"Saukkonen, Natalia/O-5827-2016; Laine, Teemu/E-3615-2016","Laine, Teemu/0000-0002-4150-7583",,,,,29,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1122,1132,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200086,0

Studies on changes of spatial patterns of a financial industry are scarce, especially at the branch level. This paper is the first attempt to take spatial interdependence and urbanisation effects into account to investigate the determinants of China's bank branches' performances from 1997 to 2011. We have chosen the world's 10th largest bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, because it discloses the most complete panel data of all. Empirical evidence indicates that spatial effects and urbanisation have large, statistically significant impacts on branches' performances. It highly and positively corresponds to tertiary industry output (domestic consumption) and urbanisation. This signals that the ABC has evolved from a state-owned specialised bank to a listed commercial bank.","[Liu, Yi-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Yang, Wen] Tamkang Univ, Dept Stat, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Mai, Chao-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Mai, Chao-Cheng] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University; Tamkang University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Liu, YC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",,"Liu, Yi-cheng/AAO-9177-2021",,,,,,45,2,3,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2015,38.0,1,,,SI,,21,47,,10.1111/twec.12194,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AZ9BS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348506900002,0

Design/methodology/approach - The framework adopts a systemic knowledge-based perspective to construct the complex network of variables of the project governing system coordinated by the SPE. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are used to elicit knowledge from expert and identify concepts and relationships associated to the variables of the SPE project governing system. Several scenarios are generated by performing FCM simulation. Originality/value - The proposed research framework allows dealing with the particular nature of uniqueness and complexity of infrastructure megaprojects by adopting a case-based systemic research approach to the study of the SPE and its project governing system that does not simplify, but rather preserves these project characteristics, and, in the same time, takes into account environment and context factors. Practical implications - The simulation output has showed that the contractor(s) technical capability, the SPE project management and planning capability and the SPE technical capability are important variables of the SPE governing system which influence project performance. Because of its flexibility, the framework can be used to model the project governing system coordinated by the SPE at different stages of the megaproject lifecycle, thus identifying the more important features and functions of the different SPE configurations.","Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"lo Storto, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale V Tecchio 80, Naples, Italy.",,"Storto, Corrado lo/C-9779-2018",,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,323,338,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200025,0

The first was the deep global financial and economic crisis in 2008. After a brief economic recovery occurred in 2012 in the European Union another, more moderate economic recession. Reason for its existence was excessive indebtedness of some euro area countries, mainly Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain. The debt crisis and uncertainty about the future of the European economic and monetary union was the cause of creation of the second, though less severe economic recession. Slovak economy in the pre-crisis period was characterized by high economic growth. In 2007 gross domestic product grew year on year to 10.7%. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.6%. This article aims to assess the impact of the global financial and economic crisis as well as the second economic recession in 2012 on the EU economy and on the economy of Slovakia. Economic performance evaluation was based on the development of basic macroeconomic indicators, notably real GDP, unemployment rate and public debt. We focused on the comparison of the development of the demand side of the economies, so domestic and external demand in the last decade. For this purpose we used statistical data from Eurostat. Based on the analysis it can be concluded that due to the global financial and economic crisis the EU economy in 2009 declined year on year by -4.4% and the Slovak economy by -5,3%. This at a time stopped positive development of the Slovak economy. After a brief recovery in both economies, a second recession took place in 2012 in the EU. Reason for its creation was the debt crisis and uncertainty and fears of further economic development. EU gross domestic product fell year on year by -0.4% and in the euro area by -0.7%. From 2015 we can expect a positive development and growth of both economies.","[Matouskova, Eleonora] Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Matousková, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,855,861,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400109,0

Design/methodology/approach - This research is a documental study about KM and how is related as driver on the INNOV; to achieve this, it was designed a questionnaire splitted in two parts: the first one, corresponding to KM that involved (5) factors: KM Leadership (KMLD); KM Capture and Acquisition (KMCA); KM Training and Mentoring (KMTM); KM Policies and Strategies (KMPS); KM Communications and Rewards (KMCR) with 23 total indicators as variables. The second one, INNOV that involved (6) factors: Innovation Value Added (IVADD); Innovation Input Items (IIIT); Innovation Process (INPROC); Innovation Output Items (IOIT); Innovation Performance (IPERF) and Innovation Feedback (IFEED) with 39 total indicators as variables. So, we designed a questionnaire (62 variables), as a measurement instrument based on Likert Scale (1to 5 interval) in order to determine the degree of agreement with well Cronbach's Alpha confidence (0.8432). We proceeded to do a survey to the total 200 CEOs belonging to the SMEs from SSG. The results were analysed using Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) to find validity and reliability of the structure to discover by the system equations, the underlying variables and their interrelationships. Finally, we found most representative KM variables to drive the INNOV, were: KMCA (0.9095); KMCR (0.8845); KMTM (0.8815); KMLD (0.8780); KMPS (0.8235). Finally we solved the (5) hypotheses finding the relationship between the KM factors and INNOV have significant positive effects. Originality/value - It lies in the design of a construct that identify the underlying KM factors and variables sized according an exploratory and multi-correlational study to drive the INNOV. All the factors and variables were collected from the principal theories about both subjects and jointed in a solid set by SEM to find their respective correlations. Practical implications - This study, shall serve to the SSG to identify what variables and factors from KM, are able to drive the INNOV and get a better place for competitiveness.","[Mejia-Trejo, Juan; Sanchez-Gutierrez, Jose] Univ Guadalajara, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Los Belenes, Zapopan, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Mejía-Trejo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guadalajara, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Periferico Norte 799 G 306, Los Belenes, Zapopan, Mexico.",,"SANCHEZ-GUTIERREZ, JOSE/P-8490-2015; MEJIA TREJO, JUAN/HNP-8104-2023","SANCHEZ-GUTIERREZ, JOSE/0000-0002-0120-7201;",,,,,50,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1813,1826,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200140,0

Sport activities implemented in the course of basic education are instrumental in the development of physical abilities and acquisition of motor skills that are important for systematic sports training, as well as recreational, leisure time activities later in life. School sports clubs are organised forms of activity targeting a wide base of children, among which, only a few meet the criteria for becoming top athletes. Sport has a significant impact on the psychosomatic development of children and youth, i.e. the development of the abilities, characteristics and motor skills applicable throughout one's life. Aside from improving the child's motor and functional abilities and facilitating the acquisition of important motor skills, sport also holds valuable developmental, educational, preventive, socially-protective and rehabilitative potential.

Defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts(Deterding et al., 2011a), gamification is useful to engage/fun users in solving problems and increase their contributions, 1 drawing on the strengths of co-creation, leading to a wider understanding/adoption of applied co-creation practices. Stemming from these premises, we aim at discussing gamification as an application to foster creativity, understand how such a perspective may become a core driver in supporting existing brands and helping them in involving customers throughout the (co) design process of new products/services. Analyzing MulinoBianco digital strategy, our purpose is twofold: how gamification changes behaviors, develops skills and drives innovation in various industries(Hamari et al., 2014b); how gamification would shape the future of knowledge creation(Hamari, 2013). Design/methodology/approach - Our article dwells on the theoretical analysis of gamification and its applicability on the engagement of consumers, throughout the design process, broadly definable as 'any act of collective creativity'(Sanders, Stappers, 2008), by using elements of game thinking and mechanics in a non-game contexts, integrating consumers into advertising and brand-building, which would enable even a boost to companies' outcomes. Practical implications - What emerges from our paper is that gamification applied to a food company digital strategy brings it into direct contact with consumers and their creativity, also creating new opportunities for business. It is quite interesting to stress how gamification, intertwining with interaction design, pulls consumers into the brand and engages them in exhilarating/addictive ways of developing non-game products and services having more engaged customers, to crowdsourcing innovation or improving employee performance(Burke, 2012).","[Paiano, Anna Paola; Valente, Lara; Mele, Gioconda] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Euro Mediterranean Incubator, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Valente, L (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Euro Mediterranean Incubator, Via Monteroni SN, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,,,,,,,65,1,1,1,39,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,117,131,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200009,0

First of all, the study highlighted a prevailing idea, that a family is a social institution primarily concerned with facilitating the reproduction, socialization and support of the personal and emotional status of its members. Second, our research into the idea of a happy family brought forward the notion of a large family with several children, characterised by mutual understanding, harmony and love. Third, we found that female students on the whole held a positive view of parenthood. We also identified the perceived drawbacks of parenthood among the students. Finally, we examined views on what being a parent involved. The research led to the conclusion that at the cognitive and emotional levels, there is no breakdown of the institution of the family in Russia. At the same time, there appears to be a growth in negative attitudes toward parenthood, which evolve under the influence of external factors. One of the approaches to making reproductive attitudes more resilient against such factors is to ensure that university education systems make a provision for components focused on reproductive intentions and behaviours.","[Shubat, Oksana; Bagirova, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, Ul Mira 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shubat, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ul Mira 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013; Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093; Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",,,,,10,1,1,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1397,1404,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000133,0

In particular, we have verified the disclosure about the following: customers, suppliers, competitors, institutions, environment, community, human capital and corporate governance and financial lenders. For each stakeholder, we have selected a set of disclosure items from the following sources: Global Reporting Iniziative (GRI) Guidelines; European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) ESG Guidelines; CSR-SC Project Guidelines, arranged by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy during the Italian Presidency of the European Union. Secondly, we tried to highlight the trend over time of stakeholders' related disclosure, also considering both the effects of the crisis and the introduction of the Legislative Decree n. 32/2007 which led to the amendment of Article 2428 of Italian Civil Code (which is the body of rules on the preparation of financial statements). Such provisions introduced for the first time in Italy, although in voluntary terms, further information than those financial in the managers' report. Design/methodology/approach - As for the first contribute, unlike previous works put in the mainflow voluntary disclosure literature, our study does not dwell only on the analysis of mandatory annual documents but on all corporate documents: annual and consolidated financial statements, management, sustainability and corporate governance reports. For each stakeholder, we determined an index comparing the number of items disclosed by the company to the maximum number of items selected. As for the second contribute, we carried out this analysis with reference to the years 2006, 2009 and 2012 in order to describe the effects of the disclosure before and after the introduction of the above mentioned legislation. Originality/value - To our knowledge, this is the first study on voluntary disclosure that compute all the stakeholders, by following the broad approach of the Stakeholder Theory, as different dimensions of the corporate disclosure. It is also the first study in Italy that assigns an index to the disclosure released by company per each stakeholder, in order to make comparisons between different subject to which the disclosure is related. Practical implications - As we said previously, it is a first step for the comprehension of the behavior of listed companies in releasing information about all corporate stakeholders, in order to conclude whether and which of these stakeholders would seem to gain or to lose from the disclosure made by firms.","[Solimene, Silvia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law & Econ Prod Act, Rome, Italy; [Coluccia, Daniela; Fontana, Stefano] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [D'Amico, Eugenio] Third Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Solimene, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law & Econ Prod Act, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1291,1305,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200099,0

Whether investment is crowded in or out in the short term depends on policy shocks triggering debt expansions: higher debt can crowd in investment for cutting capital tax rates or increasing government investment. Contrary to the conventional view, no systematic relationships between real interest rates and investment exist, explaining why reduced-form regressions are inconclusive about crowding out. At longer horizons, distortionary financing is important for the negative investment response to debt.

To counteract farmland biodiversity loss and other environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, European farmers can apply Agri-environmental schemes. One of these is the creation of flower strips, a part of the cropping field where flowers are sown or naturally settled. Flower strips are known to increase biodiversity in the agricultural landscape, notably attracting specific insects groups, such as pollinators and natural enemies that can provide valuable pollination and biocontrol services to the crop. However, the plant species composition and management of the strips can have a large influence on the identity and amount of useful insects present in the strips, suggesting the need to develop tailored flower strips to maximize the services delivered. Functional diversity (FD) is sometimes proposed as a promising approach, focusing on plant functional traits rather than plant species itself. Yet, it is not certain that sowing a set of plant species results in the desired vegetation with the desired functional trait composition. Species from soil seed bank or dispersing from neighboring vegetation can settle in the strip, while sown species might not always be equally adapted to local conditions. To test this, we developed seed mixtures with four different levels of FD, based on flower traits, and sew them as flower strips in a conventional arable field. We monitored the vegetation to calculate the FD of the realized vegetation. While the absolute FD values of the realized vegetation were lower than the expected FD values, the realized vegetation showed the same FD gradient as expected from the sown mixtures, indicating that it is possible to manipulate FD in flower strips.

In this context, the main purpose of the paper was to investigate the relation between features of Generation Y online buying behaviour and socio-psychological variables. The data was collected through survey questionnaire using the purposive sample of 515 Croatian Generation Y consumers from the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. The empirical survey was carried out in March and April 2014. Various multivariate statistical analyses were used such as factor analysis and analysis of variance. The findings revealed that Generation Y online consumers were influenced by three major factors, namely compulsiveness, impulsiveness and functionality. Furthermore, the analysis showed significant differences between compulsiveness, impulsiveness and functionality factor, and socio-psychological variables (social status, fashion interest and binge eating). The results indicated that compulsive and impulsive consumers associated their online purchases with a higher social status, stronger fashion interest and binge eating. On the other hand, the findings showed that Generation Y consumers who primarily made their purchase online due to functionality exhibited a strong interest in fashion and linked online purchases with a higher social status. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the functionality factor and a binge eating disorder. These findings may be useful to online retailers and internet marketers to recognize the role of socio-psychological variables in an online environment in order to foster more positive attitudes towards online buying enhance the overall online shopping experience and increase online buying intentions.","[Vojvodic, Katija; Matic, Matea; Matusic, Duro] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Vojvodic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400042,0

The analysis is relevant to situations where institutional constraints bar the use of the price mechanism: the allocation of workloads under fixed salaries, a commodity under disequilibrium prices, etc. In these contexts suppliers and demanders naturally have single-peaked preferences. We evaluate transfer rules on the basis of the replacement principle (Thomson, J Econ Theory 76(1):145-168 1997; Moulin, Q J Econ 102:769-783 1987), the requirement that a change in an agent's preferences affects all other agents in the same direction in terms of welfare. We find that the only Pareto-efficient, participation-compatible, replication-invariant, and envy-free rule satisfying an appropriate formulation of the replacement principle is the egalitarian rule introduced by Bochet et al.

The findings confirmed quantitatively the empirical literature and showed that large-scale ryokans are relatively more efficient than smaller operations, which is commonly observed in the accommodation industry.

In addition, we find that global housing market developments have predictive power for domestic financial stability. Finally, econometric measures of bubble-like behavior in housing and credit markets enter with positive and highly significant coefficients. Specifically, we find that the probability of a crisis increases markedly when bubble-like behavior in house prices coincides with high household leverage.

The study includes three veins: first, tracing the evolution of price dispersion and changes in the shape of the cross-region price distribution over time; second, analysing changes in price ranking of regions (rank mobility); and third, analysing quantity mobility with the use of stochastic kernel. Results obtained evidence that regional relative prices in Russia remained fairly stable during 2001-2010. No significant changes are found in price dispersion and cross-region price distribution over this time span. Rank mobility was very low with seasonal surges. The pattern of quantity mobility manifests neither convergence nor divergence of regional prices. However, a long-run price distribution has an unpleasant feature, predicting potential emergence of a price convergence club in the Russian Far East. Given that potentialities for price convergence among Russian regions existed by 2001, the pattern obtained can be termed stagnation rather than stability.","[Gluschenko, Konstantin] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Siberian Branch, Pr Lavrentieva 17, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Gluschenko, Konstantin] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Econ, Novosibirsk, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Novosibirsk State University,"Gluschenko, K (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Siberian Branch, Pr Lavrentieva 17, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.;Gluschenko, K (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Econ, Novosibirsk, Russia.",glu@nsu.ru,"Gluschenko, Konstantin/H-1138-2013","Gluschenko, Konstantin/0000-0003-1209-3809",,,,,28,2,4,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This study investigates whether these multilateral and regional trade institutions increase food trade and bring the world into a freer flow of food. The gravity model of international trade is used for the empirical analysis. The model is developed in a large panel data setting and attempted to address some potential problems in the estimations including multilateral trade resistances, zero trade values and endogeneity. The results suggest that both the WTO and RTAs have delivered significant positive effects on trade among the participant countries, but not food. Only RTAs are found to have increased food trade among the participant countries.

The way these shocks interact is examined in this paper using a global macromodel with national portfolio rebalancing and asset differentiation and a representation of unconventional monetary policy. Results are found to be sensitive to the contributions of productivity and capital accumulation to China's growth. When these are offered in realistic combination, the effects are deflationary in the United States and China, militating against contractionary US monetary policy. Monetary responses in the United States and China then combine with price targeting regimes in the EU and Japan to expand liquidity globally, amplifying impacts on financial markets and the global distribution of real investment.","[Tyers, Rod] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Acton, ACT, Australia",University of Western Australia; Australian National University,"Tyers, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA, Australia.;Tyers, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Acton, ACT, Australia.",,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415",Australian Research Council Discovery Grant [DP0557885]; Australian Research Council [DP0557885] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Funding for the research described in this paper is from Australian Research Council Discovery Grant No. DP0557885.

The net environmental effect can be negative since there is a the trade-off between the substitution effect - how many passengers using the HSR are shifted from air transport - and the traffic generation effect - how much new demand is generated by the HSR. We conduct a simulation study based on the London-Paris market where HSR has served 70% of the market. The introduction of HSR is detrimental to LAP, while it is beneficial to GHG emissions. HSR entry increases neither LAP nor GHG emissions when the ratio between HSR and air transport emissions is relatively low. Moreover, competition is more likely to be detrimental to the environment when the weight of the social welfare in HSR objective function is high. Since the magnitude of the environmental friendliness of HSR compared to air transport hinges on the mix of energy sources used to generate the electricity (which is heavily constrained by the country in which HSR operates), regulators should assess the implications of HSR entry taking into account the energy policy and mitigation strategies available to transport modes.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an evolving fuzzy-GARCH modeling approach for stock market asset returns forecasting. The method addresses GARCH volatility modeling within the framwork of evolving fuzzy systems. This hybrid methodology aims to account for time-varying volatility, from GARCH approach, as well as volatility clustering and nonlinear time series identification, from evolving fuzzy systems, which use time-varying data streams to continuously and simultaneously adapt the structure and functionality of fuzzy models. The motivation is to improve model performance as new data is input through gradual model construction, inducing model adaptation and refinement without catastrophic forgetting while keeping current model useful. An empirical application includes the forecasting of S&P 500 and Ibovespa indexes by the evolving fuzzy-GARCH against traditional GARCH-family models and a fuzzy GJR-GARCH methodology. The results indicate the high potential of the evolving fuzzy-GARCH model to forecast stock returns volatility, which outperforms GARCH-type models and showed comparable forecasts with fuzzy GJR-GARCH methodology.","[Maciel, Leandro; Gomide, Fernando] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn & Automat, Ave Albert Einstein 400, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Ballini, Rosangela] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Dept Econ Theory, R Pitagoras 353, BR-13083857 Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Maciel, L (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Comp Engn & Automat, Ave Albert Einstein 400, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",maciel@dca.fee.unicamp.br; gomide@dca.fee.unicamp.br; ballini@eco.unicamp.br,"Maciel, Leandro/B-1046-2015; Gomide, Fernando/AAR-8803-2020; Ballini, Rosangela/B-1560-2015","Maciel, Leandro/0000-0002-1900-7179; Gomide, Fernando/0000-0001-5716-4282; Ballini, Rosangela/0000-0001-6683-4380","Brazilian Ministry of Education (CAPES); Research Foundation of the State of Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/13851-3]; Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) [304596/2009-4, 306343/2011-8]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [11/13851-3] Funding Source: FAPESP",Brazilian Ministry of Education (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Research Foundation of the State of Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),"The authors thank the Brazilian Ministry of Education (CAPES), the Research Foundation of the State of Sao Paulo (FAPESP) Grant 2011/13851-3, and the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) Grants 304596/2009-4 and 306343/2011-8, for their support.",,70,15,17,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

However, these positive attitudes are not translating into similarly positive behaviour changes in terms of complying with these new speed limits. Recent research from the authors studied the complex relationship between support and compliance, with qualitative findings suggesting that copycat driving could create a 'vicious circle effect' that leads to increased levels of non-compliance. However it is also possible that an alternative 'virtuous circle' effect may emerge from the high levels of societal support for 20 mph limits pressurising drivers to comply with speed limits. In this work the authors investigated these issues and we report on data and analysis of a large scale survey of drivers and residents undertaken in Great Britain. We explain the origins of vicious and virtuous circles in driver behaviour and study the data from the survey, offering an analysis of attitudes and claimed behaviours that has implications for policy-makers and professionals working with low urban speed limits. We discuss the issues for speed limit enforcement, making reference to the public relations 'battle' for public opinion. It is concluded that normative compliance, triggered by community and other campaigning, may be the most realistic mechanism for countering the difficulties of government funding in promoting compliance.

When computing the adoption rate for reaching a decision in these scenarios, multiple linear inequality restrictions in combinatorial countings are present. These rates cannot be computed in closed form. We introduce a general method for incorporating multiple inequality conditions in multiple majority decisions, which significantly reduces the number of involved summations and removes restrictions on the summation indices. Exact solutions are provided through (a) integral representations which can be evaluated numerically, and (b) unrestricted, contracted sums over discrete events. Further, we provide methods to reduce the number of necessary summations by splitting or recurring the original problem to easier sub-problems. For five dedicated scenarios, full results are given which indeed require a single unrestricted summation only.","[Wendemuth, Andreas] Univ Magdeburg, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Cognit Syst Grp, POB 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Simonelli, Italo] McDaniel Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Westminster, MD 21157 USA",Otto von Guericke University,"Wendemuth, A (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Cognit Syst Grp, POB 4120, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",andreas.wendemuth@ovgu.de; isimonelli@mcdaniel.edu,,"Wendemuth, Andreas/0000-0001-6917-8198",Transregional Collaborative Research Centre - German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TRR 62],Transregional Collaborative Research Centre - German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),One of us (A.

A taste-based model makes no such prediction. I compare these models using trial records from England and Wales in 1870, 1883, and 1910, years with extensive jury trials and broad latitude in sentencing for judges. In the earlier years, higher status defendants accused of property crimes receive substantially longer sentences, with no such difference for violent crimes. In contrast, higher status defendants are less likely to be convicted at trial, both when accused of property crimes and of violent crimes. In a Heckman selection empirical model, selection into sentencing has a large effect on the magnitude of these sentencing patterns. For property crimes, there is negative selection on unobservable traits, possibly explained by using imperfect proxies for social class. I conclude that an optimal sentencing and deterrence model is more supported for property crimes than for violent ones, with judges balancing disparate rates of conviction from juries.

Using vulnerability assessments as well as adaptation practices that support mitigation, MPOs are beginning to integrate climate change planning into the long range planning process. Evaluating the state-of-the-practice of adaptation planning and adaptation in support of mitigation is useful in that it helps identify gaps and areas of improvement. Therefore, this research investigates the state-of-the-practice of MPO adaptation planning using the Mid-Atlantic region as a case study. Surveys, administered in 2012 and 2014, are used to identify the level of progress of MPOs with regard to climate change adaptation practices as well as barriers before and after Hurricane Sandy. A cross-sectional analysis using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) maps the results of the surveys and spatially compares regional trends. The results of the case study suggest growing interest in adaptation efforts such as floodplain area designations and efforts to enhance coordination and collaboration as transportation jurisdictions respond to the potential climate change impacts. In addition, MPOs with dense, smaller geographic areas prioritize inter-jurisdictional collaboration as high, suggesting that they are more reliant on other agencies to maintain inter-connectivity of transportation networks and further implement adaptation planning practices.

We find that subjects with higher cognitive ability are more sensitive to strategic uncertainty than those with lower cognitive ability.","[Hanaki, Nobuyuki] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Hanaki, Nobuyuki] Skema Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Paris Sch Econ, 106 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, MSE, 106 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Luchini, Stephane] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Luchini, Stephane] EHESS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Zylbersztejn, Adam] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Zylbersztejn, Adam] Univ Lyon 2, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Zylbersztejn, Adam] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Hanaki, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.;Hanaki, N (通讯作者)，Skema Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France.",Nobuyuki.HANAKI@unice.fr; nicolas.jacquemet@univ-paris1.fr; stephane.luchini@univ-amu.fr; zylbersztejn@gate.cnrs.fr,"Jacquemet, Nicolas/F-4736-2010; Zylbersztejn, Adam/G-8370-2017","Jacquemet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5056-9225; Zylbersztejn, Adam/0000-0001-6987-3190; HANAKI, Nobuyuki/0000-0003-3127-690X","JSPS-ANR bilateral research Grant BECOA [ANR-11-FRJA-0002]; LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon within the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-007]; LABEX OSE of the Paris School of Economics within the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-007, ANR-10-LABX_93-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-FRJA-0002] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",JSPS-ANR bilateral research Grant BECOA(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon within the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); LABEX OSE of the Paris School of Economics within the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This project is partly financed by JSPS-ANR bilateral research Grant BECOA (ANR-11-FRJA-0002).

The proposed measure is time-dependent and it estimates the realisation of the travel impedance by the community of passengers for travelling between an origin destination (OD) pair. The main advantage of the developed measure, as compared to the existing transit impedance measures, relates to its capability in capturing the diversity benefit that the transit systems may offer the society of travellers with different traveling preferences. To clarify the necessity of such capability, we demonstrate the randomness (subjectivity) of travel impedance perceived by transit passengers, through evidence from the observed path choices made in the transit network of the greater Brisbane metropolitan region in Australia. The proposed impedance measure is basically a nested logit logsum composition over a generated set of reasonable path options whose systematic utilities are evaluated based on a discrete choice model previously developed and calibrated for the greater Brisbane transit passengers. As a case study, the proposed impedance measure is calculated for all the origin blocks in the Brisbane area, during the morning commutes to the Central Business District (CBD). The results are presented and discussed, and intuitive and important advantages are demonstrated for the proposed measure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Individuals can interact with the market maker an arbitrary number of times before the state of the world is revealed. We show that the resulting sequence of prices is convergent under general conditions, and explore the properties of the limiting price and trader portfolios. The limiting price cannot be expressed as a function of trader beliefs, since it is sensitive to the market maker's cost function as well as the order in which traders interact with the market. For a range of trader preferences, however, we show numerically that the limiting price provides a good approximation to a weighted average of beliefs, inclusive of the market designer's prior belief as reflected in the initial contract price. This average is computed by weighting trader beliefs by their respective budgets, and weighting the initial contract price by the market maker's worst-case loss, implicit in the cost function. Since cost function parameters are chosen by the market designer, this allows for an inference regarding the budget-weighted average of trader beliefs.","[Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Vaughan, Jennifer Wortman] Microsoft Res, 641 Ave Amer,7th Floor, New York, NY 10011 USA",Columbia University; Microsoft,"Sethi, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rs328@columbia.edu; jenn@microsoft.com,"Sethi, Rajiv/AAH-3961-2020","Sethi, Rajiv/0000-0003-2631-5644",,,,,31,7,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper addresses this shortcoming in the literature by examining the flow-performance relationship for real estate funds, specifically open-end, direct-property funds. This investment vehicle is designed to provide the risk-return benefits of private market real estate and is available to retail investors in many countries across the globe. An understanding of fund flow dynamics associated with this investment vehicle is of particular interest due to the liquidity risk associated with holding an inherently illiquid asset in an open-end structure. Our analysis draws on the theoretical foundations provided in the literature on mutual fund flows, performance chasing, liquidity risk, participation costs and dynamics across market cycles. We focus on German real estate funds from 1990 to 2010 as this is the largest market globally and there is a high level of confidence in the data. The results show that real estate fund investors chase past performance at the aggregate level and the relationship between flows and relative performance is asymmetric (i.e., convex) at the individual fund level. Fund-level liquidity risk tends to weaken convexity, while sensitivity increases with higher participation costs. We find the flow-performance relationship varies across time, though our interpretation is asset and investment vehicle specific. The implications are applicable to investors and fund managers of open-end, direct-property funds and, more broadly, other alternative asset funds where the underlying asset may not be liquid.","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Sebastian, Steffen; Woltering, Rene-Ojas] Univ Regensburg, Int Real Estate Business Sch, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Weistroffer, Christian] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of Regensburg; European Central Bank,"Woltering, RO (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Int Real Estate Business Sch, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",dhdowns@vcu.edu; steffen.sebastian@irebs.de; christian.weistroffer@ecb.europa.eu; rene.woltering@irebs.de,,,Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University; International Real Estate Business School (IREBS) Foundation,Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University; International Real Estate Business School (IREBS) Foundation,"We received excellent feedback from several discussants, including Aleksandar Andonov (2014 MNM Conference), Piet Eichholtz (2015 AREUEA-ASSA), and Michael White (2014 AREUEA-International) as well as helpful comments by participants at those presentations.

This includes investigating which group of travellers have used the new tram extension earlier than others, and integrated the tram extension as a part of their daily travel patterns. This paper also describes the design and construction of the four-wave panel data collection, which was collected from two weeks before and up to seven months after the opening of the new option. Descriptive analysis shows that within a seven-month period, 79% of the respondents tried the new tram extension but only 14.9% of them adopted the new option as their daily travel mode. During the observed period, about 493% of the respondents migrated between travel modes for non discretionary trips. Further multivariate analysis shows that middle-income travellers and travellers who owned car(s) used the new tram extension earlier than others. The effect of past experience on the current use of the tram extension on a day-to-day basis was also examined by using a mixed logit model with panel data.

Because of this inattention, scholars have missed the opportunity to examine a crucial facet of the financialisation of the state. To remedy this limitation, the present article investigates how and why the Italian government designed derivatives-based strategies during the 1993-9 period. It argues that these tactics gained momentum in the context of the political struggles that developed in Italy beginning in the late 1980s. In particular, the study shows how a neoliberal-reformist alliance came to power and used financial innovation to comply with the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) admission criteria. EMU dynamics enhanced the power position of the neoliberal-reformist coalition vis-a-vis the country's traditional political and business establishment. This work offers insights that go beyond the specificities of the Italian case. It encourages further research on how governments in other countries simultaneously exposed state institutions to financial speculation and gained access to a range of new instruments through which they could manage state affairs in a financialised manner.","[Lagna, Andrea] Univ Erfurt, Fac Law Social Sci & Econ, Ctr Polit Practices & Orders, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany",University of Erfurt,"Lagna, A (通讯作者)，Univ Erfurt, Fac Law Social Sci & Econ, Ctr Polit Practices & Orders, House 38,Postbox 102,Nordhauser Str 63, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany.",andrea.lagna@uni-erfurt.de,,"Lagna, Andrea/0000-0002-8990-1352",,,,,139,68,69,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

To do so it employs an empirical strategy based on the differences-in-differences panel data method with double fixed effects. Data are provided by Spain's National Statistics Institute (INE) and cover 50 provinces over a 15-year time span (1998-2013). Our results provide mixed evidence about the impact of HSR accessibility on tourist outcomes. On the one hand, we find that air traffic is negatively affected by HSR and air traffic is a strong predictor of tourist arrivals. This suggests a negative indirect effect of HSR on tourist outcomes. On the other hand, HSR may have a positive (weak) direct effect on tourism. However, such result is conditioned on the measure of HSR accessibility and econometric technique used. Thus, the net effect of HSR on tourism outcomes is not consistently positive. This pattern might be attributed to a network design that does not respond to ridership needs and which has a substitution effect on air transportation, the main mode for long-distance tourist mobility.

This article provides a nuanced answer to this question by studying bilateral investment treaties (BITs). We develop a game theoretic model of BIT signing in which the government of a capital-importing country and an investor from a capital-exporting country strategically interact. The model predicts that, on the one hand, when host states highly value foreign direct investment (FDI), the likelihood of BITs increases as their judicial institutions lack credibility. On the other hand, when their preferences for FDI are only modest, the likelihood of BITs increases as their judicial institutions become more credible. We employ Cox proportional hazard models to test our hypotheses, and the results largely support our theory. Our findings have broad implications for the large literature on credible commitment, which has paid insufficient attention to the interplay between preferences and credibility.","[Cho, Seok-ju] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Yong Kyun] Univ Pacific, Sch Int Studies, Stockton, CA 95211 USA; [Lee, Cheol-Sung] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of the Pacific; University of Chicago,"Kim, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Pacific, Sch Int Studies, Stockton, CA 95211 USA.",ykim@pacific.edu,"Cho, Seok-ju/AAK-5456-2020","Cho, Seok-ju/0000-0001-6417-0517",,,,,49,3,4,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This paper uses a new farm level database in order to identify a representative farming household typology and to draw conclusions about the productivity of each farm household type.

Indeed, we show that in the two-groups contest, for most degrees of privateness of the prize, the large group uses its sharing rule as a mean to exclude the small group from the competition, a situation called monopolization.

This crucial question is left aside by the contemporary literature on industrial policy insofar as it assumes that the primary barrier to industrial upgrading and learning is on the 'supply side' of states facilitating private firms' pursuit of their already-established drives. We inquire into the necessary conditions for businesses' engagement with long-term thinking and innovation in contexts that reinforce preferences to stay in low-innovation, high-rent niches . Drawing from five cases in 'inertial' Latin American competitive environments where industries nevertheless voluntarily broke free of inertial trajectories to seek new approaches to business, we find that conditions of 'systemic vulnerability' - a combination of shocks in demand, sectoral comp-etitiveness and civil/social conflict - force business elites to reconsider their constituents and investment timeframes. Based on these observations, we contribute to theories of industrial policy and industrial upgrading by identifying the 'demand side' factors that affect whether firms are prepared to be competent partners in today's 'assistive,' market-reinforcing models of industrial policy.","[Fuentes, Alberto] Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Pipkin, Seth] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Fuentes, A (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,,86,9,13,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Here we investigate this issue through the properties and topologies of corporate elite networks and ask: what is the community structure of the global corporate elite? In order to answer this question, we analyse how the largest one million firms in the world are interconnected at the level of corporate governance through interlocking directorates. Community detection through modularity maximisation reveals that regional clusters play a fundamental role in the network architecture of the global political economy. Transatlantic connections remain particularly strong: Europe and North America remain interconnected in a dense network of shared directors. A distinct Asian cluster stands apart as separate and oriented more towards itself. While it develops and gains economic and political power, Asia remains by and large outside the scope of the networks of the incumbent global (that is, North Atlantic) corporate elite. We see this as a sign of the rise of competing corporate elites. But the corporate elites from the traditional core countries still form a powerful opponent for any competing faction in the global corporate elite.","[Heemskerk, Eelke M.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Takes, Frank W.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Heemskerk, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, POB 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.m.heemskerk@uva.nl; ftakes@liacs.nl,"Takes, Frank/G-8038-2016","Takes, Frank/0000-0001-5468-1030",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),Heemskerk received financial support of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).,,84,85,87,3,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The article then employs this framework to compare China and India's progress in this regard. It finds that China has confronted the basic reform challenges more successfully, has more impressive innovation outputs, and has integrated into global networks more successfully.

Despite this, accurate risk measures have considerable value in trading and risk management with the topic being actively researched for better techniques. We approach the problem by using a multifactor, dynamic, quantile regression formulation, extended to include GARCH properties, and applied to both in-sample estimation and out-of-sample forecasting of traded electricity prices. This captures the specification effects of mean reversion, spikes, time varying volatility and demonstrates how the prices of gas, coal and carbon, forecasts of demand and reserve margin in addition to price volatility influence the electricity price quantiles. We show how the price coefficients for these factors vary substantially across the quantiles and offer a new, useful synthesis of GARCH effects within quantile regression. We also show that a linear quantile regression model outperforms skewed GARCH-t and CAViaR models, as specified on the shocks to conditional expectations, regarding the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts of value-at-risk.","[Bunn, Derek; Chen, Dipeng] London Business Sch, Dept Management Sci & Operat, London NW1 4SA, England; [Andresen, Arne; Westgaard, Sjur] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7041 Trondheim, Norway",University of London; London Business School; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bunn, D (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, Dept Management Sci & Operat, Sussex Pl,Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",dbunn@london.edu,"Bunn, Derek W/P-5247-2016","Bunn, Derek/0000-0003-1770-4488",,,,,48,40,42,2,41,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2016,37.0,1,,,,,101,122,,10.5547/01956574.37.1.dbun,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DA2OD,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367634800005,0

In particular, we prove that it selects allocations that are envy free up to one good - a compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and - even more so - in practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation, and demonstrate that it scales well on real data.

De Novo optimization is an approach for designing efficient systems by reshaping the feasible set.

The first stage measures fund collection efficiency and the second stage calculates operational efficiency of investment process. The estimated overall technical efficiency of the two-stage indicates that on average, deposits were under-produced in the first stage of production. Inefficient banks produce inside the production possibility set and should be able to simultaneously expand loans and securities given inputs and an appropriate choice of deposits if they become efficient. As a consequence, the underproduction of deposits resulted in fewer loans and securities investments. The results also found that the two-stage network system is superior to traditional DEA in the banking sector and confirmed that the traditional DEA approach overestimates efficiency scores.","[Hanclova, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Hanclova, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852",,,,,18,2,2,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,254,259,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500044,0

Our econometric models show that energy prices and green innovation activities are positively related and that energy prices have a significantly positive impact on the ratio of green innovations to non-green innovations. More concretely, our main model shows that a 10% increase of the average energy prices over the previous five years results in a 3.4% and 4.8% increase of the number of green innovations and the ratio of green innovations to non-green innovations, respectively. We also find that the impact of energy prices increases with an increasing lag between energy prices and innovation activities. Robustness tests confirm the main results.","[Ley, Marius; Stucki, Tobias; Woerter, Martin] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Stucki, T (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ley@kof.ethz.ch; stucki@kof.ethz.ch; woerter@kof.ethz.ch,"Woerter, Martin/E-6186-2010","Woerter, Martin/0000-0003-4467-9134; Stucki, Tobias/0000-0002-2400-0107",Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE,Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE,"This article has greatly benefited from the guidance of the editors and the valuable comments and suggestions of two anonymous reviewers of this journal.

In contrast to previous studies, we do not consider the codecision procedure in isolation but include several aspects of the EU's wider institutional framework. The finding that the Council is more influential than the Parliament due to its more conservative internal decision rule is robust to adding 'context' to the basic model, but the imbalance is considerably attenuated.","[Maaser, Nicola] Univ Bremen, Dept Econ, ZeS, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Mayer, Alexander] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Econ, Bayreuth, Germany; [Mayer, Alexander] Publ Choice Res Ctr, Turku, Finland",University of Bremen; University of Bayreuth,"Maaser, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Dept Econ, ZeS, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",maaser@uni-bremen.de; alexander.mayer@uni-bayreuth.de,"Maaser, Nicola Friederike/IXN-3011-2023; Mayer, Alexander/ABG-5820-2021","Maaser, Nicola/0000-0003-3054-567X",,,,,42,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2016,46.0,1,,,,,213,237,,10.1007/s00355-015-0910-7,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020500009,0

We introduce a new model of partial information which aims at enhancing the market trigger approach while remaining analytically tractable. We address also CoCos having the additional feature of being callable by the issuer at a series of pre-defined dates. These callable CoCos are thus exposed to a new source of risk-referred to as extension risk-since they have no fixed maturity, and the repayment of the principal may take place at the issuer's convenience.","[Manuel Corcuera, Jose; Valdivia, Arturo] Univ Barcelona, Fac Math, Gran Via Les Corts Catalanes 585, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Corcuera, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Math, Gran Via Les Corts Catalanes 585, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",jmcorcuera@ub.edu; arturo.valdivia@ub.edu,"Valdivia, Arturo/AFB-6578-2022","Corcuera, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-8457-3962",Spanish MCINN [MTM2013-40782],Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government),"The work of J.M.

Usually, a large amount of real datasets is required in order to get valid results in quality evaluation analysis. However, real datasets are very rare. Therefore, this paper presents an algorithm for generating mixed-type datasets containing a required structure, i.e. desired number of clusters, different number of categories, distance between clusters or their interpenetration, etc. In the paper, we demonstrate abilities of the proposed generator on several illustrative examples.

Can we use ambidexterity to improve the productivity of modern workers belonging to Generation Z? The article also focuses on the problem of attitudes to ambidexterity in the familial and educational environment. The total sample included 51 students under 20 years old and 98 parents. The authors applied an original questionnaire, which consisted of three parts: identification of ambidextrous abilities; students' attitude to ambidextrous people; and the experiences of parents who have ambidextrous children. As a result, it was found that the majority of the respondents demonstrated neutral attitudes towards ambidexterity and that the manifestations of ambidexterity were minimal when the respondents were using traditional tools (for example, a pen, a pencil, a cup, etc.), and these manifestations became more pronounced when the respondents were asked to operate modern gadgets (for example, a tablet computer, a TV remote control, a smartphone, flash drives, etc.). Our research has found differences between the views of parents and students about ambidexterity as a phenomenon and as a source of human potential. It is important to conduct further studies of ambidexterity since it can contribute to the fulfillment of human potential.","[Novitsky, Alexey; Lysenko, Elena] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Novitsky, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",alexei.novitsky@gmail.com; e.v.lysenko@urfu.ru,"Lysenko, Elena/AAJ-2867-2020",,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1364,1372,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100135,0

For the latter they use a simple iteration procedure and study the strong approximation error of the resulting numerical scheme given that the volatility process is fully observed. In this work we present the corresponding weak limit theorem for the setting, where the volatility/drift process needs to be numerically simulated. In particular, weak approximation errors for smooth test functions can be obtained from our asymptotic theory.","[Podolskij, Mark] Univ Aarhus, Dept Math, Ny Munkegade 118, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Thamrongrat, Nopporn] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Math, Neuenheimer Feld 294, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Aarhus University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Podolskij, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, Dept Math, Ny Munkegade 118, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",mpodolskij@creates.au.dk; Thamrongrat@stud.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Podolskij, Mark/0000-0002-3302-2455",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Research Training Group RTG 1953,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Research Training Group RTG 1953,Nopporn Thamrongrat gratefully acknowledges support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Research Training Group RTG 1953.,,27,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",2194-1009,,978-3-319-23425-0; 978-3-319-23424-3,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,138.0,,,,,,101,120,,10.1007/978-3-319-23425-0_4,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BL8LX,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000456658600004,0

To this end, we describe: the basic differences in approaches between the EU and the complaining parties with regard to genetically modified crops, what the main arguments were of the complaining parties as well as the defence of the EU, what the final judgement of the panel was and finally, we describe the current EU regulations. We then analyse to what extent, the arguments and conclusions of the panel still hold regarding the new EU legislation. We find that parts of the current EU legislation, that is, the safety bans as they are currently in place, are in breach of the WTO commitments. Moreover, the new approval procedures have the potential to also break these rules, although whether or not they will, depends on how the European Commission acts.

Prevention is promoting a positive lifestyle for juveniles by helping them overcome their problems in different aspects of life (family, peers, school, workplace) and it is also more cost effective for the state to influence the risk factors of a child and his family at an early stage than have to pay for the treatment of that same child when he enters the judicial criminal system. That is why it is necessary that every state develops an effective prevention policy that should become a part of national criminal and social policy in long-term. Prevention needs to be focused on the so called children at risk which means that prevention programmes should be used to eliminate the causes of criminal behaviour in child's life and indirectly in his family and community as well. This paper analyzes what are some of the basic principles that have to be taken into consideration when implementing an effective prevention program for juveniles regarding international documents for juvenile offenders (UN, Council of Europe, European Union) and main developments in prevention of juvenile delinquency and also what are some of the prevention programmes that were or are still being implemented in different European countries.","[Radic, Ivana] Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia",,"Radic, I (通讯作者)，Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia.",iradic@pravst.hr,"Radić, Ivana/F-4201-2017",,,,,,13,0,0,1,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,117,130,,,,,,14,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400012,0

It provides its users with a simple and effective way to input necessary information concerning his/her preferences through pair-wise comparisons, as well as various consistency measures of the expressed preferences. The linguistic level attached to Saaty's fundamental scale provides a seemingly easy-to-use interface between the model (pair-wise comparison matrices) and its users. In this paper we focus on the linguistic level of Saaty's fundamental scale and analyze the consequences of its use as it was proposed by Saaty. We show that even in the context of the consistency condition as defined by Saaty, the linguistic level seems to be improperly defined and calibration of the linguistic labels might be in place. Also proper transformations into different languages rather than simple translations of the terms suggested in English are necessary. We argue, that in the context of the existence of a transformation between the multiplicative and additive form of Saaty's matrices it is reasonable to investigate whether the additive or the multiplicative form should be used to confirm (or appropriately set) the meanings of the linguistic terms. We illustrate on a practical example how the calibration of the meanings of linguistic terms in the additive form can affect the performance of the linguistic level in terms of consistency in the multiplicative form.","[Stoklasa, Jan] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc 77180, Czech Republic; [Talasek, Tomas] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Deptartment Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Talasek, Tomas] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland",Palacky University Olomouc; Palacky University Olomouc; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Stoklasa, J (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc 77180, Czech Republic.",jan.stoklasa@upol.cz; tomas.talasek@upol.cz,"Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016; Talášek, Tomáš/E-3464-2017","Talášek, Tomáš/0000-0001-8632-4599",,,,,12,2,2,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,785,790,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500135,0

The influence of financial crisis is analysed through changes in labour productivity in years during crisis (2008-2013) and the year before crisis (2007). Two measures of labour productivity have been used. The first one presents a ratio between total revenue and number of employees while the second one focuses on total sales instead of on total revenue. Number of employees is analysed as well.

The main objective of the paper is to test whether the individual assets cluster by the country to which they belong or whether the origin is of lesser importance, leading to cross-country links within the topological structure. By analyzing particularly the MST, we identify interesting relationships, providing evidence for both country and industry clustering, with the finance sector dominating the inter-country relationships. The apparent clustering identified by visual inspection is shown to be significant and non-random, as shown by the results of Erdos - Renyi, as well as Viger - Latapy simulations. The result is also confirmed by an ERGM model, where country and industry level factors are shown to significantly contribute to the way the networks are constructed.","[Vyrost, Tomas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Vyrost, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",tomas.vyrost@euba.sk,"Vyrost, Tomas/AAO-3780-2020","Vyrost, Tomas/0000-0002-8384-5724",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,2027,2036,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100198,0

Therefore, this status quo Ecology University of Physical Education in-depth thinking, and presented their views, hoping to better carry out the teaching of university sports, to promote the further development of ecological education.","[Yan, Pengxi] Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Yan, PX (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,1768,1771,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500380,0

The model parameters were estimated using the entropy approach and information priors. The models were formulated on the aggregated scale of the irrigated scheme, considering the main regional irrigated crops as well as land, labour, capital and water resources.

The technological progress experienced in the more developed economies and its transfer to other regions, especially Asia and Latin America, led, at that moment, to-the doubling of yields for some cereal crops which are basic for the human diet, like rice, wheat and maize, besides the productivity of other plant species and livestock This real production boom has been able to meet rising food demand in the past 30 years and has also ensured a certain stability to food prices.

We find that hemoglobin level, a marker for anemia, is,lower for respondents with no schooling (0.7 g/dL less in the adjusted model) compared to those with some formal education and is also lower for females than for males (2.0 g/dL less in the adjusted model). In addition, we find that about one third of respondents in our sample aged 45 or older have high C-reaction protein (CRP) levels (>3 mg/L), an indicator of inflammation and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We find no evidence of educational or gender differences in CRP, but there are significant state-level disparities, with Kerala residents exhibiting the lowest CRP levels (a mean of 1.96 mg/L compared to 3.28 mg/L in Rajasthan, the state with the highest CRP). We use the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to explain group-level differences, and find that state-level disparities in CRP are mainly due to heterogeneity in the association of the observed characteristics of respondents with CRP, rather than differences in the distribution of endowments across the sampled state populations.

The paper uses census division-year-specific skill-biased technology shocks as an instrument for mothers' earnings and employs a two-sample instrumental variables strategy. About 14 million records of births between 1989 and 2004 are used from the Natality Detail files along with the CPS Annual Demographic Files from the same period. The results reveal that an increase in weekly earnings prompts an increase in prenatal care of low-skill mothers (those who have at most a high school degree) who are not likely to be on Medicaid, and that earnings have a small positive impact on birth weight and gestational age of the newborns of these mothers. Specifically, if a mother's earnings double, this produces a weight gain of the newborn by about 100 g and an increase in gestational age by 0.7 weeks. An increase in earnings does not influence the health of newborns of high-skill mothers (those with at least some college education). Variations in earnings have no impact on birth weight for mothers who are likely to be on Medicaid. (C) 2015 ElseVier B.V.

The influence of the investors is also crucial in the decision making mechanism of the tourism community to maintain sustainable tourism development.","[Yang, Zhenzhi; Yang, Dan; Cai, Yinchun] Sichuan Univ, Tourism Sch, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Shi, Hong] Sichuan Univ, China Leisure & Tourism Ctr, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dan] China West Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xuanyu] Panzhihua Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Panzhihua, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; Sichuan University; China West Normal University; Panzhihua University,"Yang, ZZ (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Tourism Sch, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yzz310@163.com; 421157695@qq.com; yangdan_0822@163.com; 3294247343@qq.com; rxy352@163.com,"Shi, Hong/ABD-5693-2021","Shi, Hong/0000-0003-4597-408X; Yang, Zhenzhi/0000-0003-2221-5195",,,,,46,13,13,6,94,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

By analyzing the temporal profile of airline fares, we identify three main results. First, code-share increases fares especially for early bookers. Second, the higher prices in code-shared flights are offered by marketing carriers.

The data set covers 266 intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) that vary in size and substantive scope and includes data on IGO issue area and founding membership characteristics that complement the measures on voting rules. The article outlines the characteristics and categorization of voting rules in the data set and establishes the broader importance of voting rules by illustrating how they help states achieve four core institutional design objectives: control, compliance, responsiveness, and effective membership. The utility of the data set and patterns in the relationships between its variables are identified through the evaluation of preliminary propositions connecting institutional context and voting rule selection. The preliminary findings emerging from this analysis establish a platform for further analyses of voting rules in IGOs, as well as other dimensions of the design and function of IGOs.","[Blake, Daniel J.] IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain; [Payton, Autumn Lockwood] Alfred Univ, Alfred, NY 14802 USA",IE University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Alfred University,"Payton, AL (通讯作者)，Alfred Univ, Alfred, NY 14802 USA.",daniel.blake@ie.edu; lockwoodpayton@alfred.edu,,"Blake, Daniel Justin/0000-0002-5663-5545",,,,,63,44,49,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Regional factors appear to be particularly important. Focusing on the European Monetary Union, we detect no significant differences between countries current members and non-members in the sources of output variability.

Reliance on net trade flowsto account for horizontal intra-industry tradeand on unit valuesto capture within-product differentiationchanges the features of the product space. Based on a highly detailed data set of both trade value and volume and spanning over 144 countries, the amended product space put forth in this paper shows that China has indeed expanded its trade profile to now occupy also product areas that are typically associated with higher-income countries. However, China's remarkable success in expanding horizontally within the product space is strongly qualified by the introduction of the vertical dimension, which shows the country to be occupying mostly the low-unit value segment of product categories, more akin to the typical trade profile of a developing country.","[Ferrarini, Benno] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ London, Dept Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, London, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ Diritto & Ist, Rome, Italy",Asian Development Bank; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ferrarini, B (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Manila, Philippines.",,,"Scaramozzino, Pasquale/0000-0003-4917-6560","Swiss National Science Foundation, through the National Centre of Competence in Research-Trade Regulation","Swiss National Science Foundation, through the National Centre of Competence in Research-Trade Regulation","At the time of writing, Benno Ferrarini was Senior Research Fellow at the World Trade Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland, benefiting from financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation, through the National Centre of Competence in Research-Trade Regulation.

A revision based on testing super exogeneity with impulse-indicator saturation,EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Australia; Ricardian equivalence; Lucas critique; Super exogeneity; Impulse-indicator saturation,SELECTION; CONSUMPTION; POLICY,"Following the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis, many countries, including Australia, enacted fiscal stimulus packages in the hope of reviving their economies by encouraging aggregate demand. For the success of these efforts, it is vital that fiscal policies have some positive impact on the real economy. However, tax reductions and cash handouts are virtually ineffective if consumers are Ricardian and internalise the intertemporal budget constraint of the government. This paper aims to test the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis for Australia from 1960 to 2011 by exploiting the links between (1) Ricardian equivalence and the Lucas critique; (2) the Lucas critique and super exogeneity, and (3) testing for super exogeneity with impulse-indicator saturation. As there is no evidence of a structural break in the conditional model for the growth rate of per capita real gross domestic savings, we conclude that policy-regime shifts did not lead to substantial changes in the estimated relationship, so the Lucas critique does not apply. Consequently, our results indicate that during the past half-century Ricardian equivalence held in Australia. This implies that tax and cash bonuses of the government may not lead to the desired economic outcomes as Ricardian-type consumers tend to offset the dissaving of the government by saving more and leaving household consumption unchanged.","[Konya, Laszlo; Abdullaev, Bekzod] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Kónya, L (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",l.konya@latrobe.edu.au; b.abdullaev@latrobe.edu.au,"Konya, Laszlo/C-3118-2008","Konya, Laszlo/0000-0001-5613-7258",,,,,45,0,1,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Given Rosen's (1974) result that hedonic coefficients can be interpreted as the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the good, the hedonic model can be used to calculate the benefits of policies based on improving school performance or public safety. One of the key assumptions for this interpretation of the hedonic coefficients as MWTP is that the market is in equilibrium. The recent turbulence in the U.S. housing market has led many researchers to question the interpretation of the hedonic coefficients. Putting periods of significant market instability aside, housing markets go through cycles just as the economy does. One might expect, then, that hedonic coefficients will also vary over the housing cycle. A house price hedonic for the Greater Boston Area is estimated using transactions data over a long time period, 1987-2012, that covers multiple cycles with peaks in 1988 and 2005. The impacts of standardized test scores, crime rates, and job accessibility on house prices are estimated on an annual basis. Surprisingly, there is evidence that these estimates exhibit a counter-cyclical variation with the largest impacts occurring during the recent downturn. This can be explained by changes in the composition of buyers over the housing cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We suggest that one possible rationale behind this form of sanction is targeting group-specific deterrence. For some groups of agents, hybrid sanctions act indeed as a self-selection mechanism such that deterrence is obtained only after a critical threshold of infractions is reached. We apply our model to traffic law infractions and further test it, performing a micro-econometric analysis on a unique dataset of a representative sample of 50,000 Italian drivers, over six years (20032009), after the introduction of a penalty points system. Our findings empirically confirm our theoretical predictions. When repeated infractions are at stake, well-designed hybrid sanctions, such as the penalty point system designed for traffic law enforcement, may indeed increase overall deterrence. Our results shed new light on the role of the combined monetary and non-monetary sanctions to perform general and specific deterrence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

I scientifically replicate their empirical exercises to test the validity of the theory in Egypt, where there is also high prevailing son preference, but little research on its implications for child health investments. I additionally examine whether using the exclusive breastfeeding rate as an alternative outcome yields supportive evidence for the theory.

A number of scholars have suggested that between 1600 and 1900 Southeast Asian living standards declined significantly. The present article contributes to these issues by calculating long-term real wages for Java between 1680 and 1914, following Allen's subsistence basket methodology. New data on wages and prices were collected from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) archives and connected to data on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The resultant long-term real wage developments show a slightly different picture of Javanese living standards than that which has emerged from the literature to date.","[de Zwart, Pim] Int Inst Social Hist, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; International Institute of Social History (IISH-KNAW); Utrecht University,"de Zwart, P (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Hist, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pza@iisg.nl; jvz@iisg.nl,,,,,,,60,20,22,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Competing hypotheses about this influence, derived from economic, social psychological and sociological approaches, are tested. The findings indicate that information about bargaining outcomes elsewhere has no significant effect on the occurrence of conflict. However, if the information content of spillover refers to the conflict potential in other bargaining events and the sources of information are proximate, the probability of conflict is increased. This suggests that sociological mechanisms offer a compelling alternative to those invoked in economics for explaining the relationship between spillover and conflict.","[Lehr, Alex] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Polit Sci, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Akkerman, Agnes] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sociol Ind & Lab Relat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Akkerman, Agnes] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Polit Sci, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Torenvlied, Rene] Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm, Publ Management, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Twente,"Lehr, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Polit Sci, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.lehr@fm.ru.nl,"Lehr, Alex/P-3091-2019","Lehr, Alex/0000-0002-0136-9737","Conflict and Security programme of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [432-08-022]; Nijmegen School of Management, Radboud University, the Netherlands","Conflict and Security programme of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Nijmegen School of Management, Radboud University, the Netherlands","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Conflict and Security programme of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), grant #432-08-022 and from the Nijmegen School of Management, Radboud University, the Netherlands.",,65,5,8,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We assume that the cost of using these facilities depends on their congestion level and that there are two types of agents with different congestion costs: high-and low-cost agents. High-cost agents are affected by congestion more severely than low-cost agents. The theory of congestion games predicts that cost heterogeneity will not affect the facility choices of agents. We obtain experimental results that support this theoretical prediction, namely that cost heterogeneity influences neither the facility choices of agents nor the congestion levels of facilities. By using data derived from the laboratory experiment, we then develop state-action tables and computationally simulate the facility choices of subjects. We find that a subject decides whether he or she remains in the same facility or moves to the other facility in the next period according to the current congestion level.","[Maeda, Taiyo] Saitama Inst Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Fukaya Shi, Saitama 3690293, Japan; [Matsumoto, Shigeru] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo 1508366, Japan; [Murata, Tadahiko] Kansai Univ, Fac Informat, Takatsuki, Osaka 5691095, Japan",Saitama Institute Technology; Kansai University,"Matsumoto, S (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Shibuya Ku, Room 828,Bldg 8,4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",t71092@aoyamagakuin.jp,,"Matsumoto, Shigeru/0000-0002-8883-7926","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This work was partially supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan under Collaboration with Local Communities Project for Private Universities starting 2005, and a Promotion Project for Joint Research between the Humanities and Social Science starting 2008.",,10,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The key idea is that a shipping line's published schedule is the optimal decision that minimizes the sum of fuel cost and time-associated costs of the containers adopted by the shipping line. Using the proposed method, we find that the adopted values of transit time for nine trans-Pacific services operated by Orient Overseas Container Line and five trans-Pacific services operated by Maersk Line are between US$5/TEU/day and US$30/TEU/day. We further demonstrate how the adopted value can be used for designing the optimal transit times between ports, analyzing the viability of slow-steaming, checking whether ships should speed up to catch up to connecting ships on other services, and helping to predict the market share of less polluting fuels in view of rules on air emission.

Drawing on secondary data from Chinese government sources, electric bicycle industry websites, Chinese media sites and other sources, this exploratory paper positions the development of the electric bicycle market as occurring largely in the absence of positive policy intervention in stark contrast to the nurturing afforded the electric car sector world-wide. The paper develops a multi-scalar perspective of transitions theory in an institutional setting, with examples drawn from Beijing and Fuzhou, to explain the processes of change outside of the traditional reference context of technology policy and management. It is concluded that transitions theory has a greater flexibility and adaptability as an explanatory framework than previously shown, but empirically the electric two-wheeler is a weakly-embedded alternative to mainstream automobility.

Despite calls for increased domestic consumption, opinion remains divided as to the extent to which policy-makers will make a genuine departure with China's export-orientation. This paper argues, however, that the direction of the Chinese political economy will depend much on the transformative role of workers' struggles. Placed in a broader north-east Asian comparative perspective, we argue that China appears to be on the verge of a transition towards a limited labour supply, as evidenced in increasing labour shortages, rising wages costs and new forms of labour unrest. An in-depth case study of the strike at Nanhai Honda in 2010 suggests that China's migrant workers are beginning to develop a class consciousness and move from reactive to proactive demands. Furthermore, the response of the Chinese state and employers has shifted from one of outright repression to one of accommodation. These trends are likely to be highly significant in terms of China's uneven integration into the global economy.","[Gray, Kevin] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England; [Jang, Youngseok] Sungkonghoe Univ, Chinese Studies, Seoul, South Korea",University of Sussex,"Gray, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Arts B368, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England.",k.gray@sussex.ac.uk; jys80@skhu.ac.kr,"Gray, Kevin/IWL-9326-2023","Gray, Kevin/0000-0002-8456-8562",,,,,50,16,17,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The theory suggests that a foraging society's history of climatic shocks shaped the timing of its adoption of farming. Specifically, as long as climatic disturbances did not lead to a collapse of the underlying resource base, the rate at which hunter-gatherers were climatically propelled to experiment with their habitats determined the accumulation of tacit knowledge complementary to farming. Consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the empirical investigation demonstrates that, conditional on biogeographic endowments, climatic volatility has a hump-shaped effect on the timing of the adoption of agriculture.","[Ashraf, Quamrul] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Michalopoulos, Stelios] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Michalopoulos, Stelios] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Williams College; Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ashraf, Q (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,Hellman Fellows Program; National Science Foundation [SES-1338738],Hellman Fellows Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, Philippe Aghion, two anonymous referees, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Gregory Dow, Oded Galor, Nippe Lagerlof, Ashley Lester, Yannis Ioannides, Clyde Reed, David Weil, and seminar participants at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Brown University, the First and Second Conferences on Early Economic Developments, the 2010 DEGIT XV Conference, and the 2011 Annual Conference of the Royal Economic Society for their comments and suggestions.

Although such railway systems have been feasible in terms of construction technologies and economics, public acceptability must be considered for the successful introduction of such a new public infrastructure. Therefore, to perform the analysis of public acceptability, a telephone-based survey was conducted for residents in the vicinity of the planned the deep subterranean railway systems. As a result, about 70% of the respondents answered that they took a neutral or opposing attitude to introducing the deep subterranean railway systems. Awareness of the deep subterranean railway systems has a positive impact on its acceptability. In addition, the acceptability is found to show a negative relationship with environment and inconvenience factors. Based on the analysis results, an affective approach through soft measures such as awareness campaigns and advertisements is recommended to effectively address and mitigate the concerns and issues raised by the public.

The rule states that a player keeps on incrementing her strategy in the same direction if her utility increased and reverses direction if it decreased. The paper concentrates on games on the square as mixed extensions of games. We study in general the behavior of the system in the interior as well as on the borders of the strategy space. We then describe the system asymptotic behavior for symmetric, zero-sum, and twin games. Original patterns emerge. For instance, for the prisoner's dilemma with symmetric initial conditions, the system goes directly to the symmetric Pareto optimum. For matching pennies, the system follows slowly expanding cycles around the mixed strategy equilibrium.","[Laslier, Jean-Francois] Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, F-75014 Paris, France; [Walliser, Bernard] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"Laslier, JF (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",jean-francois.laslier@ens.fr; walliser@mail.enpc.fr,"Laslier, Jean-Francois/GSJ-2634-2022; Laslier, Jean-Francois/K-1539-2019","Laslier, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8334-1350;",,,,,31,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2015,79.0,1,,,,,51,93,,10.1007/s11238-014-9450-3,0.0,,,43,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CM9ZM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358070200004,0

Different from the previous empirical literature, we allow for long-run and short-run effects, testing for cointegration and accounting for cross-dependence among different commodities. An automatic model selection algorithm is used to obtain a dominant congruent econometric model, selecting among many potential explanatory variables. As the effects of commodity prices' determinants may vary over time and across commodities and we are estimating single conditional models, poolability and exogeneity issues are also evaluated. Our results indicate that commodity price formation in the long run is determined by supply and demand factors, apart from the US exchange rate. We find significant effects of individual commodity production and the demand-pull of China's economy. The economic growth of both emerging and developed countries as well as the dollar's depreciation, inventory changes, and easier monetary policies also have significant short-run effects on real commodity prices.","[Ahumada, Hildegart; Cornejo, Magdalena] Di Tella Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Cornejo, M (通讯作者)，Di Tella Univ, Ave Figueroa Alcorta 7350, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",hahumada@utdt.edu; mcornejo@utdt.edu,,,National Council for Scientific and Technological Promotion of Argentina [2008 1122],National Council for Scientific and Technological Promotion of Argentina,"This research was partially supported by grants from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Promotion of Argentina (Grant No. 2008 1122).

With that objective in mind, we specify and estimate a global vector autoregressive model (GVAR) for fourteen countries of the former EU15 and the United States (USA), using quarterly macroeconomic, monetary and fiscal data from 1978 to 2009. Unlike other GVAR models with fiscal variables, in our study we consider total public receipts and total public expenditure separately, and model not only the euro area economies but also all countries of the former EU15 (except Luxembourg) and the USA. The results of our simulations show that the responses of real GDP to a negative (positive) domestic/global shock to total public expenditure (total public receipts) seem to be negative (positive) for the analyzed economies. The effects of domestic shocks would be larger in the country of origin of the shock, while their spillover effects would be limited. The effects of global shocks reveal a remarkable degree of similarity in the cyclical behavior of the European economies. As policy recommendations, we suggest boosting the slow process of coordination of fiscal actions in the EU in order to avoid unwanted economic consequences.","[Ricci-Risquete, Alejandro; Ramajo-Hernandez, Julian] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Ricci-Risquete, A (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",alericci@unex.es; ramajo@unex.es,"RAMAJO, JULIAN/M-5515-2013","RAMAJO, JULIAN/0000-0002-3156-8315; Ricci-Risquete, Alejandro/0000-0001-6435-6688",,,,,27,14,16,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We show that their political trajectories can be explained by differences in their organizational structure and distribution of resources within the party's leadership. When a party depends on resources linked primarily to one individual, it will develop a personalized decision-making structure advantaging its leader, and the party's fortunes will be tied to the popularity (or lack of same) of the leader. By contrast, when a party relies equally on resources from several groups, a more consociational style of decision-making is likely to emerge. Using Ukraine as a case study, the article shows that personality-led parties will be more vulnerable to defections and less capable of absorbing potential competitors. On the other hand, coalition-led parties are better capable of surviving defeats, maintaining internal cohesion, and merging with like-minded parties.","[Kudelia, Serhiy] Baylor Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Kuzio, Taras] Univ Alberta, Canadian Inst Ukrainian Studies, Ctr Polit & Reg Studies, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Baylor University; University of Alberta,"Kudelia, S (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",Sergiy_Kudelia@baylor.edu,"Kuzio, Taras/R-9564-2019","Kuzio, Taras/0000-0002-5888-3892",,,,,71,26,29,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

To undertake the analysis, the article departs from a strictly intergovernmental-supranational study of institutional relations by building upon the concept of mandate overlap'. Additionally, the focus is on the constitutive policy approach of each institution. The EDA's approach is characterized as ad hoc and project-based in nature, and the European Commission's approach is structural and market-based. Once the two approaches are delineated, the article then investigates whether either of the bodies has deviated from their respective mandates over a period beginning in 1996 and ending in 2013. On this basis, the conclusion is that there is evidence of rivalry between the two bodies, especially when European Union Member States decide to use either entity to secure their interests.","[Fiott, Daniel] Vrije Univ Brussel, Res Fdn Flanders FWO, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Fiott, Daniel] Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Fiott, D (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, 1 Floor,5 Pl Laan, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",daniel.fiott@vub.ac.be,"Fiott, Daniel/ABB-2733-2020","Fiott, Daniel/0000-0002-2378-3568",,,,,28,17,17,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The findings provide evidence of non-linearity when windows with a fixed number of observations are considered. The non-linear specification that seems to do the best job of summarizing such non-linearity is the scaled specification, which considers not just whether oil prices increase or decline (and by how much) but also the environment in which the movements take place, highlighting more specifically the importance of controlling for the time-varying conditional variability of oil price shocks. An oil shock in a stable price environment is likely to have larger consequences on stock returns than one in a volatile price environment. Moreover, we find negative responses of real stock returns to oil price shocks for all countries. These responses are generally statistically similar between the North American countries considered, and between the European countries studied, although statistically different between the two groups of countries.","Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Jiménez-Rodríguez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Econ, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",rebeca.jimenez@usal.es,"Jimenez-Rodriguez, Rebeca/B-2190-2017","Jimenez-Rodriguez, Rebeca/0000-0002-7669-2467",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-38860-C02-01],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"I thank the editor, Robert Kunst, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The spatial relationship occurs because a worker's workplace is spatially separated from his/her residence. This separation imposes a geographic barrier to better understanding the interactions between housing and labor markets, especially at a micro level. Overlooking this spatial interdependency of workplace and residential locations in the existing empirical studies may explain their inconclusive or mixed results for job loss effect on foreclosure. Our paper develops a job loss vulnerability index to overcome this geographic barrier by using pair-wise home-work commute data between census tracts. After controlling for the endogeneity and measurement error problems, we find that job loss plays an important role in foreclosure decisions, particularly with rising negative equity. More specifically, estimated results suggest that when house prices drop by 10%, 30% and 50%, doubling job loss would increase foreclosure rate by about 15%-25%, 40%-60%, and 60%-100%, respectively.

We address it by applying a recently proposed Bayesian variable selection methodology to an encompassing linear mixed model that features, along with deterministic effects, additional random explanatory variables that account for the evolution of the underlying level, slope, seasonality and trading days. Variable selection is performed by estimating the posterior model probabilities using a suitable Gibbs sampling scheme. The paper conducts an extensive empirical application on a large and representative set of monthly time series concerning industrial production and retail turnover. We find strong support for the presence of stochastic trends in the series, either in the form of a time-varying level, or, less frequently, of a stochastic slope, or both. Seasonality is a more stable component, although in at least 60 % of the cases we were able to select one or more stochastic trigonometric cycles. Most frequently the time variation is found in correspondence with the fundamental and the first harmonic cycles. An interesting and intuitively plausible finding is that the probability of estimating time-varying components increases with the sample size available. However, even for very large sample sizes we were unable to find stochastically varying calendar effects.","[Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Proietti, Tommaso] CREATES, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Grassi, Stefano] CREATES, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Grassi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it; S.Grassi@kent.ac.uk,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN [prot. 2010J3LZEN]; CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78) - Danish National Research Foundation","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78) - Danish National Research Foundation","The authors wish to thank the reviewers and the editor for their careful review and constructive criticism that led to several improvements in the paper.

While economists stress the irrationality of the CAP and explain its striking persistence by rent-seeking behavior, a prominent interpretation among historians is that the CAP should be interpreted as welfare policy for farm households. I subject the latter hypothesis for the period 1962-92 to an empirical test and find that the combined benefits from subsidies, import protection, and political prices gave much more benefits to European agriculture than any welfare policy could have achieved. If one still wants to find arguments legitimizing the political rents (or part of them) that agriculture received through the CAP one has to consider non-economic arguments (food security in the Cold War) or external effects (protection of the environment or landscape).","Univ Regensburg, Hist Inst, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Spoerer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Hist Inst, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",mark.spoerer@ur.de,,"Spoerer, Mark/0000-0002-5549-6512",German Historical Institute Paris; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SP 948/4-1 579193],German Historical Institute Paris; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support of the German Historical Institute Paris and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SP 948/4-1 579193) is gratefully acknowledged.

Using instrumental variable analysis on data provided by an insurance firm in Israel (2001-2008), we find that each $100 reduction in accident costs results in a 1.7 percentage point increase in the probability of an accident. At an average accident rate of 16.3 percent, this 10 percent increase in auto accidents can be interpreted as the effect of moral hazard on car accidents.","Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Weisburd, S (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,"Weisburd, Sarit/0000-0002-9021-8294",Israel National Road Safety Authority Doctoral Fellowship,Israel National Road Safety Authority Doctoral Fellowship,"I thank Yehuda Shavit for his thoughtful advice on the nature of insurance data and its research potential.

A large literature modeling spatiotemporal autocorrelation in house prices assumes that the spatiotemporal dependence structure is isotropic: a function of only distances between observations, and therefore the direction effect is dismissed. If the importance of direction is dismissed or understated, an estimation result would be biased and therefore less precise unless the distribution of observations is in rare case of being directional homogeneous. This paper thus proposes a local anisotropic spatiotemporal approach to improve estimation performance. The methodology is illustrated by using data on single-family house transactions in the San Francisco Bay Area. The empirical results suggest that the proposed three-dimensional anisotropic modeling technique can reduce both in-sample estimation and out-of-sample forecast errors.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge,"Zhao, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",zhaojin720@hotmail.com,,,,,,,13,2,2,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It starts by showing that the classical RRM model is not scale-invariant, and that as a result - the degree of regret minimization behavior imposed by the classical RRM model depends crucially on the sizes of the estimated taste parameters in combination with the distribution of attribute-values in the data. Motivated by this insight, this paper makes three methodological contributions: (1) it clarifies how the estimated taste parameters and the decision rule are related to one another; (2) it introduces the notion of profundity of regret, and presents a formal measure of this concept; and (3) it proposes two new family members of random regret minimization models: the mu RRM model, and the Pure-RRM model. These new methodological insights are illustrated by re-analyzing 10 datasets which have been used to compare linear-additive RUM and classical RRM models in recently published papers. Our re-analyses reveal that the degree of regret minimizing behavior imposed by the classical RRM model is generally very limited. This insight explains the small differences in model fit that have previously been reported in the literature between the classical RRM model and the linear-additive RUM model. Furthermore, we find that on 4 out of 10 datasets the mu RRM model improves model fit very substantially as compared to the RUM and the classical RRM model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because many NGOs advocate liberal causes, such as human rights, democracy, and gender equality, they upset the political status quo. At the same time, a large number of NGOs operating in the Global South rely on international funding. This sometimes disconnects from local publics and leads to the proliferation of sham or 'briefcase' NGOs. Seeking to rein in the politically inconvenient NGO sector, governments exploit the role of international funding and make the case for restricting the influence of NGOs that serve as foreign agents. To pursue this objective, states worldwide are enacting laws to restrict NGOs' access to foreign funding. We examine this regulatory offensive through an Ethiopian case study, where recent legislation prohibits foreign-funded NGOs from working on politically sensitive issues. We find that most briefcase NGOs and local human rights groups in Ethiopia have disappeared, while survivors have either 'rebranded' or switched their work from proscribed areas. This research note highlights how governments can and do shape the population ecology of the non-governmental sector. Because NGOs seek legitimacy via their claims of grassroots support, a reliance on external funding makes them politically vulnerable. Any study of the NGO sector must include governments as the key component of NGOs' institutional environment.","[Dupuy, Kendra E.; Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dupuy, Kendra E.] PRIO, Oslo, Norway; [Dupuy, Kendra E.] CMI, Bergen, Norway; [Ron, James] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Ron, James] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Ron, James] Ctr Econ Res & Teaching CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO); University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Conscience capitalism encompasses projects emerging in both the for- and non-profit sectors that seek to connect neoliberal capitalism with concepts of morality and conscience. The article begins by unpacking conscience capitalism, showing how its for-profit advocates seek to transform capitalism by orienting it towards accounting for social and environmental externalities, and how its non-profit supporters seek to incorporate components of neoliberalism to serve their environmentally and/or socially focused agendas. Conscience capitalism appears to be a re-evaluation and call for reform of the prominent forms of neoliberalism. However, this article argues that, rather than comprising a hindrance, conscience capitalism offers a means of advancing the project. This is evident in its attempts to reconstitute social and environmental externalities in terms relatable to the market, and represent social and environmental problems in quantitative terms in which the success of market-based solutions can be read. Acknowledging some of the successes of conscience capitalist campaigns, the article concludes by arguing that this continued neoliberalisation of the non-profit sector favours campaigns consistent with neoliberalism and has the potential to undermine the democratic governance of non-profits.","Bournemouth Univ, Media Sch, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Farrell, N (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Media Sch, Weymouth House,Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",nfarrell@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,65,29,36,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We disaggregate the makeup of a pivotal state into two main components - capability and credibility - and underscore Japan's significant latent capabilities, but also its serious credibility shortcomings. The TPP's boost to Japan's credibility raised the possibility of significant economic, legal and political externalities for specific countries which responded by accelerating FTA initiatives that had long stalled: the trilateral China-Japan-Korea FTA, a 16-state East Asian FTA and the Japan-European Union trade negotiations.

We are able to rule out several alternative explanations for the distance finding, such as differences by continent, colonial origin, bilateral trade relationships, foreign aid flows, political regime forms, or the characteristics of the Cold War. We do not observe this geographical bias for non-military interventions, providing evidence that practical considerations could be important factors for UNSC decisions to intervene militarily. In fact, UNSC interventions are also more likely in smaller and poorer countries - both of which are indications of less costly interventions and higher chances of success, everything else equal.","[Duque, Juan C.] Univ EAFIT, Dept Econ, Res Spatial Econ RISE Grp, Medellin, Colombia; [Jetter, Michael] Univ EAFIT, Dept Econ, Medellin, Colombia; [Sosa, Santiago] Univ EAFIT, Res Grp Int Studies, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad EAFIT; Universidad EAFIT; Universidad EAFIT,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Dept Econ, Medellin, Colombia.",jduquec1@eafit.edu.co; mjetter7@gmail.com; ssosanor@eafit.edu.co,"Duque, Juan C./AAC-3331-2019","Duque, Juan C./0000-0002-4016-681X; Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200",,,,,51,1,1,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In order to shed light on the hierarchical structure of the banking system, we estimate different versions of a core-periphery model. Our main findings are: (1) the identified core is quite stable over time in its size as well as in many structural properties, (2) there is also high persistence over time of banks' identified positions as members of the core or periphery, (3) allowing for asymmetric 'coreness' with respect to lending and borrowing considerably improves the fit and reveals a high level of asymmetry and relatively little correlation between banks' 'in-coreness' and 'out-coreness', and (4) we show that the identified core-periphery structure could not have been obtained spuriously from random networks. During the financial crisis of 2008, the reduction of interbank lending was mainly due to core banks reducing their numbers of active outgoing links.","[Fricke, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Fricke, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Fricke, Daniel; Lux, Thomas] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Banco Espana Chair Computat Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Universitat Jaume I,"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",daniel.fricke@sbs.ox.ac.uk; lux@bwl.uni-kiel.de,,,"European Union [288501, 612955]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"The article is part of a research initiative launched by the Leibniz Community.

To capture the effects of a time-varying term premium on the term spread, the paper relies on an empirically attractive affine Gaussian dynamic term structure model which assumes that the term structure of interest rates is spanned by three unobserved state variables. To retrieve accurate values of these variables from interest rates series, the paper suggests a new method which can overcome the effects of measurement (or pricing) errors inherent in these series on the estimates of the model. This method is assessed by a Monte Carlo study. Ignoring these errors will lead to biased estimates of term structure models. The empirical results of the paper provide support for the suggested term structure model. They show that this model can efficiently capture the time-varying term premium effects embodied in long-term interest rates, which can explain the failures of term spread to forecast future changes in long-term rates.","[Argyropoulos, Efthymios; Tzavalis, Elias] AUEB, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Argyropoulos, E (通讯作者)，AUEB, Athens 10434, Greece.",efargyrop06@aueb.gr,,,,,,,45,3,3,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This paper examines these questions using hand-collected data from SEC merger filings. Four primary findings emerge from this study. First, REITs most often utilize a sales process resembling an auction, where an average of 19 potential buyers are contacted. Second, REIT mergers are on average just as competitive, or more so, as those in other industries. Third, the market for corporate control for REITs is more active than previously thought. Fourth, failure to account for publicly available signals that a REIT is for sale (which typically occur several months in advance prior to the official public merger announcement) results in omitting approximately one third of the total shareholder wealth effect produced by REIT mergers.","[Mulherin, J.

It is consequently argued that there is little formal entry bargaining among these actors. However, there are three primary weaknesses in this literature. First, the understanding of outcomes is limited to the terms of investment agreements. This static view ignores the dynamics of bargaining processes and decisions not to invest, which also deserve explanation. Second, it is MNC-centric, ignoring state's privileged role in relation to the governance of entry bargaining in domestic policy-making processes. Third, it views state as a monolithic entity, ignoring the bargaining that occurs inside states. To redress these issues, this article offers a state-centric bargaining model. It identifies administrative and institutional capacity as two critical components of state capacity. It chooses the entry bargaining from 2005, when Hyundai Motors Corporation considered establishing a USD1.5 billion car-manufacturing plant in Turkey.

It is then argued that whereas Monetarism brought about a revival of the quantity theory of money from the limbo into which Keynesianism had pushed it, RE-NC modelling was responsible for that theory's most recent disappearance. This happened despite the fact that, initially, RE-NC economics appeared to be a mainly technical extension and refinement of Monetarism, rather than a radically new economic doctrine.

With this purpose in mind, our research aim was to evaluate which is the best networking solution for 40 organic farmers in Calarasi County. This statistical approach was based on multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering methods that permitted us to identify three possible clusters in which to group the organic producers. The evaluation results of the agricultural patterns of each cluster demonstrated that only one cluster is viable for establishing a producers' group. The main characteristics of this cluster are: farmers are in a proximity range of maximum 40 km; at least 75% of farmers have similar farming system types; over 65% of farmers own big farms; the best place for a joint pooling, storing or selling point is the cluster centre (Calarasi). In this way, we consider that a statistical viable solution for clustering and the promotion of networking between farms with similar agricultural patterns can contribute to the creation and establishment of cost-effective supply chains and strong producers' groups.

Thus, this project investigated the impact of smartphone ownership and Internet search behavior on product purchasing related to gardening products and related items. Given the sharp rise in use of smartphones and mobile media use, how does this technological development impact retail-purchasing behaviors of green industry consumers? Differences were observed between those who had searched online for non-gardening information compared to those who had searched online for gardening information. Women were more likely to search online for both gardening and non-gardening information, but men were more likely to make online gardening purchases. Education level, ethnicity, and geographic location of residence had varying impacts on the likelihood of online search and purchase. Having searched online for non-gardening information increased the likelihood of an online purchase by 16%, while the likelihood of purchase increased to 19% for online gardening-related searches.","[Behe, B.

Particularly, it identifies and classifies the possible approaches adopted by companies on the basis of two dimensions: the intensity/proactivity of search efforts, and the source primarily used. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the approaches adopted by 15 Italian and Polish KIBS companies. It employs a multiple case-study method, which is justified due to the descriptive and exploratory nature of the research, and the complexity of the phenomenon under investigation. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews to entrepreneurs and executives of the investigated firms. KIBS companies were chosen as object of study because they are often highly innovative and, in turn, they contribute to their clients' innovative capability as well. Originality/value - The paper provides a better understanding of ways and sources of knowledge for innovation in KIBS. It has already been acknowledged that KIBS rely on various sources of knowledge for innovation, but not much is known about the approaches they adopt. The cases confirm that hardly ever KIBS use only one source knowledge for innovation. Customers are often uses as a key source of knowledge, but employees are also expected to provide innovative ideas. Therefore, KIBS companies can follow various models to acquire knowledge for innovation. In particular, some companies can have a passive approach (i.e. innovative ideas come as a kind of side-effect of their daily business), while others have an active approach (namely, they actively search for new ideas originating from various sources). In addition, some rely more on internal resources (i.e. their employees, internal departments, etc.), while others on external sources (clients, suppliers, service providers, universities, etc.). It is possible to combine these dimensions and to obtain four combinations, as is described in the paper. Practical implications - The outcomes of the study are important for both research and practice. As regards research, it contributes to the discussion regarding knowledge sources of innovation and the processes of their exploitation in KIBS firms. As regards the practice, the categorisation of the different possible approaches to innovative knowledge can help executives to identify and examine how their companies function. This can provide useful guidelines for selecting the most suitable situation-dependent approach.","[Bolisani, Ettore; Scarso, Enrico] Univ Padua, DTG Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy; [Bolisani, Ettore; Zieba, Malgorzata; Scarso, Enrico] IAKM Int Assoc Knowledge Management, Padua, Italy; [Zieba, Malgorzata] Gdansk Univ Technol, Div Management, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Paiola, Marco] Univ Padua, DSEA Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; University of Padua,"Bolisani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, DTG Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,"Zieba, Malgorzata/B-2788-2014","Zieba, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5138-9330",,,,,31,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1492,1503,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200115,0

Using this method, based on a fuzzy logic expert system, it is possible to generate a comprehensive rating for the assessment of the sustainability of a firm. In fact, to ensure that a firm is CSR-compliant, it is important to express CSR principles in terms of measurable variables. Up to now, measurement has been hampered by a lack of clarity in theoretical frameworks and empirical methods for the CSR construct. Design/methodology/approach- The analysis model is formalized through an FES (fuzzy expert system). The algorithm of the FES aggregates multicriteria evaluations of a problem. The assessments of behaviour and the resulting decisions are represented in blocks of rules, drawn up by an inference engine in fuzzy logic. The FES unites the ability of an expert system to simulate the decision-making process with the uncertainty typical of human reasoning, which is present in fuzzy logic. The main structure of the model is based on the aggregation of three components: human capital (HumanCap), strategy (Strategy) and reporting (ESGrep: Environmental, Social and Governance reporting). Originality/value - Despite the spread of CSR practices among firms, there is not a commonly accepted method of measuring sustainability. Moreover, although Environmental social governance (ESG) rating agencies provide CSR ratings, their methodologies have certain weaknesses. Considering the growing importance of socially responsible financial markets, this topic may prove to be of vital importance, above all for decision-makers in the management of their investments, by remedying the deficiencies in methodologies used by sustainability rating organizations. We also think that fuzzy logic methodology is an appropriate way of assessing sustainability because of the fuzzy nature of sustainability.

Traditionally, the model of heritage management is public, but in recent years the involvement of private profit-making enterprises increased. However, private has naturally tended to focus on the more attractive blockbuster sites, leaving Italy's extraordinarily widespread cultural heritage unprotected. Our work intend to contribute to this field of study by focusing on the emergence of a new logic in the cultural heritage field. Through a case study analysis we would describe the emergence of a new logic in the Italian cultural heritage field. Design/Methodology/Approach - Our research deals with projects and initiatives aimed at protecting and promoting the widespread cultural and natural heritage which has been re-functionalised, preserved and made accessible to local communities and visitors. These initiatives have applied the concepts of social innovation to the management of cultural field. The research is based on a qualitative investigation using the case study approach. The collection of empirical data is carried out using a heterogeneous plurality of instruments. The methods include: document analysis, semi-structured interviews and participant observations. Originality/value - The Italian cultural heritage is characterized by two coexistent logics: the conservation logic and the market logic. These logics did not allow the establishment of models for the efficient and effective management of cultural heritage. We can identify a new emerging logic in this field. The participation logic is the way to find new models to manage social issues. Indeed it takes shape in the context of social innovation initiatives. Social innovation could fill the gap of welfare state fulfilling the social need to promote cultural and creative initiatives. Practical implications - Downstream of the first phase of research we have defined the characteristics of social innovation initiatives related to the cultural heritage. We can, therefore, make a mapping of the organizations that respond to those characteristics. In addition to this, the research aim to identify the economic impact of the social innovation initiatives object of study in term of people employed, type of contract, amount of resources necessary for sustainability, impact on community and territory. It could become an important tool for policy makers to promote and develop new initiatives.","[Consiglio, Stefano; Ricchezza, Daniela] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management Inst, Naples, Italy; [Mercurio, Lorenzo; Berni, Alessia] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Management, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Parthenope University Naples,"Berni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Management, Palazzo Pacanowski,Via Generale Parisi,13 NA, Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1728,1738,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200132,0

The study adopted correlational research design with balanced panel data of 14 banks as sample of the study using multiple regression as a tool of analysis. The result reveals that firms attributes (leverage, profitability, liquidity, bank size and bank growth) has as significant influence on earnings quality of listed deposit money banks in Nigeria after the adoption of IFRS, while the pre period shows that the selected firm attributes has no significant impact on earnings quality.

All territories are divided into four types in accordance with their ability to withstand shock or recover from initial decline. A number of factors that may be associated with observed levels of resilience: sectoral composition and export-orientation of regional economies, urbanization level, and availability of adaptive workforce with higher levels of skills and qualification, is considered.

Citrus is among the top three fruits in the region. With a population of 1597 million, the per capita / annum citrus fruit availability is 7.67 kg. Mandarin and sweet orange are the major citrus fruits constituting 84%, followed by acid lime, lemon and other citrus (16%). Postharvest management is mostly on conventional lines. In north-west India and Pakistan, Kinnow (King x Willowleaf hybrid) is sorted, washed, waxed and packed in modern packing houses. Harvesting is done by clippers for Kinnow, by snapping for 'Nagpur' mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and by bamboo harvesters for 'Khasi' mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco). Total losses from farm to retail level in the region are 25-35% and vary with season and commodity. Acid lime losses increase with the onset of monsoon. Wooden boxes are used for mandarins. Oranges and acid limes are packed in jute bags. Bamboo containers 'doko' are used in Nepal, Bhutan and North-East Hill (NEH) region of India for 'Khasi' mandarin. Transportation of loose fruit in trucks is common. Refrigerated storage warehouses and modern packinghouses are being established. Citrus fruits are sold in supermarkets. Modified atmosphere packaging increased shelf life of mandarins up to 3 weeks. The use of evaporative cool chambers (1.5-8 tonnes capacity and very low energy consumption) extended the storage life of Nagpur mandarin, Mosambi orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), acid lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle), Kinnow and grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) up to 21, 40, 30, 60 and 77 days in respect to 10,14, 5, 14, and 27 days at ambient condition, respectively. Cellar stores are used in Nepal and Bhutan. The export of Kinnow from Pakistan is increasing. India exported nearly 55260 tonnes of citrus fruits in 2010. The value chain and postharvest overview in south Asia including postharvest research, conventional and innovative handling, storage structures, modern infrastructure and future challenges and prospects are discussed in this review paper.","ICAR Res Complex, Natl Res Ctr Citrus, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Citrus Research Institute,"Ladaniya, MS (通讯作者)，ICAR Res Complex, Natl Res Ctr Citrus, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",msladaniya@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,14,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1669,1676,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.214,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600214,0

The working distance and the family population structure exert remarkable efforts to enhance the singleness of rural migrants working alone. We show that the longer working distance the more probability induces the rural migrants to leave home without spouse and children accompany. We also find that the large family surplus population increases the possibility that the spouse and children accompany with them. In particular, this study also indicates that spouse and children accompanying have been gradually improved in recent years in China. Although children accompanying is lagged compare to spouse accompanying, both spouse and child accompanying is increasingly becoming an important transition model of Chinese rural migrants' permanent migration.

The main goal of this paper is to define a model for building the academic library as the vault of organized digital collections. The digital library mission implies systematic acquisition and organization of digital collections, managing collections and ensuring long-term access for users according to pre-established rules. The future of digital libraries depends on the ability of self-organization and transformation, in order to become the main centre of knowledge and distance learning, using complex software systems and constantly developing into flexible network structures. Digitization of the existing library materials, development of institutional repository, electronic publishing and organization of collections in open access, taking into account copyright regulations, should be in the focus of building a digital library. There are many significant digital library projects worldwide, but in Croatia, they are just starting. This article explores the possibilities of developing a model of the academic digital library that will be horizontally and vertically networked with other libraries, and thereby contribute not only to its own academic institution, but also to the entire creative industry on which it relies through its innovative activities and partnership with the economy.","[Mihaljevic, Jasminka] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mihaljevic, J (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasminka.mihaljevic@efos.hr,"Mihaljevic, Jasminka/J-4992-2018",,,,,,19,2,2,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,405,415,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100039,0

Heritability coefficients represent a property not only of a character, but of a population and the environment that population lives in. The aim of the researches was the study of the genetic determinism of the growth and development process in a large hen line, for two characters: body weight and breast muscle at 7 weeks old, separately by gender. The researches were carried out in Avicola Bucharest S. A. on individuals in Plymouth Rock 010 maternal line. The studied individuals owed to 40 half-sib families, respective 384 full-sib families, on a total number of 2332 males and 2462 females. To establish the causal compounds of variance it was used the statistic model with three variation sources, which leads to the genetic parameters establishing. To estimate the values of the phenotypic correlations it started from their basic formulas and there were introduced the values of the phenotypic variances and covariance. It was established the value of the genotypic correlations using the values of inter familial variance and covariance. It is necessary to know the phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations between the two studied characters to establish a correct selection base, having in view the simultaneous improvement of those.

Health expenditure increases every year together with their share in total household expenditure. The increase in drug consumption, rising supply of private health services, as well as the aging of the population, seem to decide on the increase in households health expenditure.

Rather than studying these indicators separately, we look at their interaction and carve out child health dynamics. Considering height-for-age a child's health stock and weight-for-lagged height a proxy for nutritional inputs, we develop a child health production function that features self-productivity of past health stocks and contemporaneous nutritional inputs. We test the model on a Senegalese panel of 271 children between 0 and 5 years employing dynamic panel methods to control for endogeneity in the production function. In line with previous evidence, we find that children can partially catch-up from malnutrition spells. Yet, child health stocks also deplete quickly and need constant updating in the form of nutrition. This demonstrates the importance of health memory and that malnutrition cannot be fought with snapshot interventions. Consequently, sustainable nutrition interventions have to be long term and yield higher returns the earlier they reach children. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Since abscisic acid (ABA) is a key regulator of the dehydration response, understanding how the hormone is perceived will help to identify targets to improve drought hardiness in horticultural crops. To study the involvement of the ABA perception system in the dehydration response of citrus fruit, we have performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of the ABA-signalosome components in water-stressed fruit of 'Navelate' orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) and its fruit-specific ABA-deficient mutant 'Pinalate', which is more prone to dehydration. No significant differences in the expression levels of ABA receptors (CsPYR/PYL/RCAR) were found between wild-type and mutant fruit, while those of the negative regulators (CsPP2CA) were slightly lower in the mutant. Low differences in ABA receptors and downstream protein kinases (CsSnRK2s) transcript levels were found in response to dehydration. Contrarily, CsPP2CAs gene expression was highly regulated by ABA content and showed differences between cultivars, which suggest that CsPP2CAs play a key role regulating ABA response in citrus fruits to water stress. Results obtained by ABA application indicate that although the mutant may sense ABA, the hormone signal could be impaired because of reduced CsPP2CAs levels. Overall these results highlight these components as potential targets to improve drought hardiness in citrus fruits.","[Romero, Paco; Rodrigo, Maria J.; Lafuente, Maria T.] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ciencia Alimentos, E-46010 Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Lafuente, MT (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ciencia Alimentos, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",mtlafuente@iata.csic.es,"Romero, Paco/E-8865-2017; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/H-7720-2012; Lafuente, Maria/K-7944-2014","Romero, Paco/0000-0002-7811-0897; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/0000-0003-2668-0684; Lafuente, Maria/0000-0002-6987-1440",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1483,1489,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600188,0

The economic aspects of lifelong education are little researched, although the European Commission has emphasised since 1995 that lifelong education contributes to employment and economic competitiveness, but since 1998 the term lifelong education has been associated with employment policies in Europe. The urgency of lifelong education in Europe was determined by the increasing role of education in economies, which was caused by changes in the stage of economic development in the 21st century, transiting from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Therefore, the nature of the phenomenon of lifelong education in economic reality is associated with transition to a knowledge economy in which human knowledge becomes a real factor of production in a free market, generating high value added. The role of lifelong education in an economy may be researched as a driver in the formation of a knowledge society, while its role in a national economy is associated with: 1) formation of labour (human resources); 2) it is an information source necessary for an economy; 3) it is one of the economic sectors with considerable finances. Knowledge belongs to two types of knowledge markets: the market of factors of production and the commodity market. Preparing a labour force appropriate for labour market requirements, which is one of the tasks of lifelong education, is an important prerequisite for the competitiveness of the country, its regions and enterprises. In Latvia, with a relatively small population and limited natural resources, the quality of human resources, which is also characterised by knowledge, becomes one of the factors contributing to its economic potential and its competitiveness in the global market. The research aim is to examine the specifics of lifelong education knowledge market and give a description of the situation in Latvia. However, research studies indicate that the participation rate of residents aged 25-64 in lifelong education is not high in Latvia, as the indicators of participation in lifelong education for Latvia's population were considerably lower in Latvia than on average in the EU-28 in the period 2003-2012; besides, in Latvia unlike in the other EU Member States, the participation of adults in lifelong education during the past decade followed the economic development trend (European Commission, 2013), and it was very low during the crisis in 2010, at 5.0%.","[Sannikova, Aija; Dobele, Aina; Zvirbule-Berzina, Andra] Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Sannikova, A (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Riga, Latvia.",,"Zvirbule, Andra/AAN-8223-2020; Zvirbule, Andra/AAF-5649-2019; Dobele, Aina/AAG-6002-2019","Zvirbule, Andra/0000-0001-7206-7608; Dobele, Aina/0000-0003-2264-909X",,,,,7,2,2,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,123,130,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400016,0

Apart from on-farm measures to increase water use efficiency, government intervenes through policy instruments to influence water use behaviour. Citrus growers need to take heed of these changes in policy as the majority of citrus orchards are irrigated and more detailed information on seasonal water requirements and irrigation scheduling is needed to justify the quantity of water needed for the production of citrus. Models, which are formidable tools to predict water use and crop performance, are therefore vital to provide accurate estimates of citrus water use across different climatic regions. In order to model citrus water use, a thorough understanding of the factors governing citrus water use is required. Results from measurements performed in a number of citrus orchards across climatic zones in South Africa indicated that citrus water use, under conditions of unlimited soil water supply, is not solely governed by atmospheric demand, but also by internal resistances to water movement within the plant, which limits the amount of water that a citrus tree can transpire on hot dry days. We will report on the institutional arrangements regarding water use and results from current and previous research on the water use in citrus in South Africa.","[Vahrmeijer, J.

Women, and women in rural areas in particular, are one of the most vulnerable social groups exposed to a high risk of poverty and social exclusion. At the same time, findings have shown that women do not lag far behind men regarding generation of business ideas and perceiving and exploiting business opportunities. Although a relatively new concept and phenomenon, social entrepreneurship in Croatia has already shown its potential in addressing the needs of marginalized social groups and has therefore emerged as a model that might contribute to women's empowerment. The important characteristic of social entrepreneurship is its collective nature. Solidarity, mutual support and sharing of risks and responsibilities, which are provided through social entrepreneurship, might encourage women in rural areas to enter and sustain in entrepreneurial activities. To assess the role of social entrepreneurship in empowerment of rural women, the paper will focus on two case studies of social enterprises led by women from two different rural regions of Croatia. By employing focus groups and in-depth interviews with representatives and participants of the chosen social enterprises, the empirical research will focus on the assessment of the role social enterprises might play on various dimensions of women's empowerment in local rural community.","[Vidovic, Davorka; Jozanc, Nikolina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Polit Sci, Lepusiceva 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Peric, Julia] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Vidovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Polit Sci, Lepusiceva 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",dvidovic@fpzg.hr; julia@efos.hr; njozanc@fpzg.hr,"Perić, Julia/AAC-3447-2022","Perić, Julia/0000-0001-8031-7435",,,,,41,2,2,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,713,726,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100071,0

Results from a complete blood (cell) count (CBC), serum chemical profile, and urinalysis submitted at that time were abnormal. The patient had hyperglycaemia (Glu-164mg/dl), acute renal failure (Crea-3.4mg/dl, BUN-117mg/dl) and acute liver failure (ALT-744U/L, TBIL-11.8mg/dl). The ALKP was 155U/L. The rectal temperature was 37,4 degrees C, the patient presented anaemic mucous membranes, mild dehydration (persistent skin fold thickness 2-3 seconds) and slight sensitivity to palpation in the renal lanyard. The established treatment consisted in peritoneal dialysis, rehydration and electrolyte balance, parenteral nutrition. We used PD4 peritoneal dialysis Dianeal 200 ml (1000ml /sqm). The patient was submitted to intravenous fluidotherapy with 5% Dextrose, Sodium Chloride 0.9 %, Aspatofort, Ondansetron, Metoclopramide and Duphalyte, CRI for 18 days. Abdominal ultrasound showed bile duct obstruction, abundant sludge in the gallbladder and mild modification in kidneys. Recommendation for oral treatment: Ipakitine bid, Azodyl bid and kidney diet food. The patient started to eat voluntary after 8 days of treatment. TBIL went up to 23.3mg/ml after the first 7 days and then started to decrease until it reached 0.9mg/dl at the end of the parenteral treatment. BUN and Creatinine values decreased to normal after the first 7 days of peritoneal dialysis and parenteral treatment. Peritoneal dialysis therapy plays an important role in renal failure in cats, especially in the elderly and weighing up to 10 kg. Elevated levels of creatinine and urea, hyperkalemia, hyper phosphatemia, or metabolic acidosis which do not yield to treatment can be solved using peritoneal dialysis. It also has a good effect in acute liver failure, cleaning the high levels of bilirubine. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Fleet-managed AVs relieve such concerns, managing range and charging activities based on real-time trip demand and established charging station locations, as demonstrated in this paper. This work explores the management of a fleet of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) in a regional, discrete-time, agent based model. The simulation examines the operation of SAEVs under various vehicle range and charging infrastructure scenarios in a gridded city modeled roughly after the densities of Austin, Texas. Results based on 2009 NHTS trip distance and time-of-day distributions indicate that fleet size is sensitive to battery recharge time and vehicle range, with each 80-mile range SAEV replacing 3.7 privately owned vehicles and each 200-mile range SAEV replacing 5.5 privately owned vehicles, under Level II (240-volt AC) charging. With Level III 480-volt DC fast-charging infrastructure in place, these ratios rise to 5.4 vehicles for the 80-mile range SAEV and 6.8 vehicles for the 200-mile range SAEV. SAEVs can serve 96-98% of trip requests with average wait times between 7 and 10 minutes per trip. However, due to the need to travel while empty for charging and passenger pick-up, SAEV fleets are predicted to generate an additional 7.1-14.0% of travel miles. Financial analysis suggests that the combined cost of charging infrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity, insurance, and registration for a fleet of SAEVs ranges from $0.42 to $0.49 per occupied mile traveled, which implies SAEV service can be offered at the equivalent per-mile cost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage households, and thus be competitive with current manually-driven carsharing services and significantly cheaper than on-demand driver-operated transportation services. When Austin-specific trip patterns (with more concentrated trip origins and destinations) are introduced in a final case study, the simulation predicts a decrease in fleet empty vehicle-miles (down to 3-4% of all SAEV travel) and average wait times (ranging from 2 to 4 minutes per trip), with each SAEV replacing 5-9 privately owned vehicles.

But does the visibility of inequality matter? Using data from a horticultural-foraging society of native Amazonians in Bolivia (Tsimane'), we examined whether village inequality in resources and behaviors with greater cultural visibility is more likely to bear a negative association with health than village inequality in less conspicuous resources. We draw on a nine-year annual panel (2002-2010) from 13 Tsimane' villages for our main analysis, and an additional survey to gauge the cultural visibility of resources. We measured inequality using the Gini coefficient. We tested the robustness of our results using a shorter two-year annual panel (2008-2009) in another 40 Tsimane' villages and an additional measure of inequality (coefficient of variation, CV). Behaviors with low cultural visibility (e.g., household farm area planted with staples) were less likely to be associated with individual health, compared to more conspicuous behaviors (e.g., e.xpenditurds in durable goods, consumption of domesticated animals). We find some evidence that property rights and access to resources matter, with inequality of privately-owned resources showing a larger effect on health. More inequality was associated with improved perceived health - maybe due to improved health prospects from increasing wealth - and worse anthropometric indicators. For example, a unit increase in the Gini coefficient of expenditures in durable goods was associated with 0.24 fewer episodes of stress and a six percentage-point lower probability of reporting illness. A one-point increase in the CV of village inequality in meat consumption was associated with a 4 and 3 percentage-point lower probability of reporting illness and being in bed due to illness, and a 0.05 SD decrease in age-sex standardized arm-muscle area. In small-scale, rural societies at the periphery of market economies, nominal economic inequality in resources bore an association with individual health, but did not necessarily harm perceived health. Economic inequalities in small-scale societies apparently matter, but a thick cultural tapestry of reciprocity norms and kinship ties makes their effects less predictable than in industrial societies.

To test this proposition, an original rich data set covering 4702 respondents and 58 public transport operators of 13 cities for the period 2013-2014 is used. We firstly estimate the passenger satisfaction based on customer satisfaction theory and PLS-SEM, and then take into consideration the mixed logit model to assess the effect between them. Conclusions drawn from the study are summarized as follows: (:) The effect of organizational forms on the passenger satisfaction of public transport service is confirmed. 0 Public transport services franchised to public ownership offer higher passenger satisfaction than those franchised to private ownership and mixed ownership. Public transport services regulated by the management contracts incite more passenger satisfaction than those regulated by net cost contracts and gross cost contracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we document several features of boys versus girls' relative performance in math. First, we note that the gender gap appears to increase with age (doubles between fourth grade and eighth grade). Second, we test whether commonly proposed explanations such as parental background and investments, unobserved ability, and classroom environment (including teacher gender) help explain a substantial portion of the gap. While none of these explanations help in explaining a large portion of the gender gap, we show that boys and girls differ significantly in perceptions about their own ability in math. Conditional on math scores, compared to boys, girls are much more likely to state that they dislike math or find math difficult. We highlight differences in self-assessed ability as areas for future research that might lead to a better understanding of the gender gap in math.","[Bharadwaj, Prashant] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Fed Reserve Bank New York, ICREA MOVE, BREAD, CEPR,BGSE, New York, NY USA; [Hansen, David] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Neilson, Christopher A.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Neilson, Christopher A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bharadwaj, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,"Neilson, Christopher/0000-0001-6180-2451","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-20110075, ECO2011-28822]; European Union through the Marie Curie CIG grant [FP7-631510]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD; European Union through the Marie Curie CIG grant(European Union (EU))","Giacomo De Giorgi acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R&D (SEV-20110075) and ECO2011-28822, and the European Union through the Marie Curie CIG grant FP7-631510.

The standard approach for evaluating empirical evidence is to equate low p-values with a high degree of credibility and to refer to findings with p-values below certain thresholds (e.g., 0.05) as statistically significant. The p-value is also referred to as error probability. Both terms are problematic as they invite serious misconceptions. In addition, researchers' fixation on obtaining statistically significant results may introduce biases and increase the rate of false discoveries. Misinterpretations of the p-value as well as the introduction of bias through arbitrary analytical choices (p-hacking) have been critically discussed in the literature for decades. Nonetheless, they seem to persist in empirical research and criticisms of inappropriate approaches have increased in the recent past-mainly due to the non-replicability of many studies. Unfortunately, the critical concerns that have been raised in the literature are not only scattered over many academic disciplines but often also linguistically confusing and differing in their main reasons for criticisms. Against this background, our methodological comment systematizes the most serious flaws and discusses suggestions of how best to prevent future misuses.","[Hirschauer, Norbert; Gruener, Sven] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Unternehmensfuhrung Agribusiness, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Frey, Ulrich] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Agr Umwelt & Ernahrungspolit, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wagner, Peter] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Hirschauer, N (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Unternehmensfuhrung Agribusiness, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",norbert.hirschauer@landw.uni-halle.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Theesfeld, Insa/AAE-2214-2020","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Theesfeld, Insa/0000-0002-0200-756X; Frey, Ulrich J./0000-0002-9803-1336; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889; Gruener, Sven/0000-0001-5794-7076",,,,,38,7,7,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We create an hourly panel of the fuel use of NYC's generators and use a semi-parametric approach to identify the fuel-price spread that induces the switch from oil to gas. We find that NYC's pollution emissions decrease significantly after generators switch to natural gas. Around two-thirds of these emission reductions come from reduced emission intensity within plants, while the remaining third comes from less intense dispatch of oil fired generators. To illustrate the policy impact, we simulate the introduction of a real time pricing (RTP) program in NYC. The results suggest that the environmental benefits of the RTP decreased by nearly 30% due largely to fuel switching. While we focus on RTP, these results can be used to evaluate any energy policy that has a heterogeneous impact across time or the demand profile.","[Holladay, J.

When exposed to such abuse, employees may go absent from work. We propose two possible explanations for employee absence in response to managerial abuse: a sociological explanation based on perceptions of organizational justice and a psychological explanation based on psychological strain. Both are tested using data from a sample of 1472 mental health workers. The occurrence, duration and frequency of absence are investigated using a hurdle model. Managerial abuse is found to be associated with the occurrence of absence through both perceptions of organizational justice and psychological strain. Distributive justice and depression are especially significant in explaining the relationship between abuse and absence. Once absent, duration of absence is not further affected by managerial abuse but is still linked to depression and distributive justice, whereas frequency of absence is linked to bullying and depression.","[Wood, Stephen] Univ Leicester, Management, Leicester, Leics, England; [Niven, Karen] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Braeken, Johan] Univ Oslo, Ctr Educ Measurement, Psychometr, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Leicester; University of Manchester; University of Oslo,"Wood, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Room 514,Ken Edwards Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sjw111@leicester.ac.uk,,"Braeken, Johan/0000-0002-2119-3222",NIHR [08/1604/142],NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),The collection of the data used in this article was funded by the NIHR as part of the in-patient staff morale project [Grant number 08/1604/142].,,35,6,9,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This highlights the need for a better understanding of the dynamics of the housing market and the mechanisms that drive and sustain periods of disequilibrium. In this analysis, I develop a dynamic model of the housing market where vacancies naturally arise as the error correction mechanism. I estimate this model using annual U.S. panel data at the MSA level for 1990-2011. The results show that when there is excess demand, prices rise when vacancies fall but prices do not fall when there is excess supply and vacancies rise. This is consistent with the belief that prices are sticky downwards and hence prolong housing downturns. On the other hand, when there is excess supply, there is a relatively stronger decline in new housing in response to a rise in vacancies and much less of a new housing reaction when there is excess demand and vacancies fall. Furthermore, when I allow for a structural shift in the housing market brought on by the Great Recession (2006-2011), I find that the housing market became more responsive on both sides - excess supply and demand - during this period.","[Zabel, Jeffrey] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Zabel, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",jeff.zabel@tufts.edu,,,,,,,17,8,10,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We focus on weight-for-height and weight-for-age in different survey quarters characterized by very different food price inflation rates. Using propensity score matching techniques, we find that these nutrition measures, which are sensitive in the short run, improve significantly in the fourth quarter of the survey, when the inflation rate for basic food products is low, compared to the first semester or three quarters, when food price inflation was generally high. The prevalence of underweight, in particular, falls by about 40 percent. We conclude that the best available evidence points to food penury, driven by the food and fuel price crisis combined with a short agricultural production year, as substantially increasing malnutrition amongst under-five children in Mozambique.

Successful interventions would imply a higher growth rate, not only during the treatment (when the region benefits from the transfers), but also after the expiry of the program (when the financing terminates). We investigate to what extent this happened in the case of Italy's Abruzzi region, which entered into the Objective 1 (Convergence) program in 1989 and exited it in 1996 (without a transitional regime). More specifically we focus upon the post expiry period by implementing a synthetic control approach. Our results indicate that exiting the program had a negative effect on regional per-capita GDP growth. This result is a confirmation of the widespread evidence that during their implementation EU regional policies help boost the economic performance of the treated regions. However, additional evidence suggests that the permanent effect of the treatment is negligible: the policies fail to transfer the treated regions to a permanently higher GDP growth path.

Tests of this hypothesis have previously been performed as misspecification tests after fitting a GARCH model to the original series. It is found by simulation that the positive size distortion present in these tests is a function of the kurtosis of the GARCH process. Adjusting the size by numerical methods is considered. The possibility of testing the constancy of the unconditional variance before fitting a GARCH model to the data is discussed. The power of the ensuing test is vastly superior to that of the misspecification test and the size distortion minimal. The test has reasonable power already in very short time series. It would thus serve as a test of constant variance in conditional mean models. An application to exchange rate returns is included.,"[Terasvirta, Timo] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Silvennoinen, Annastiina] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",CREATES; Aarhus University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Teräsvirta, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",tterasvirta@econ.au.dk,"Terasvirta, Timo/J-1621-2019; Silvennoinen, Annastiina/KCL-0694-2024","Silvennoinen, Annastiina/0000-0001-6371-771X",CREATES - Danish National Research Foundation [DNFR78]; National Centre for Econometric Research,CREATES - Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); National Centre for Econometric Research,"This research has been supported by CREATES, funded by the Danish National Research Foundation, Grant Number DNFR78, and the National Centre for Econometric Research.

Depending on whether or not a risk-neutral agent's confidence in the superior being, as measured by a subjective probability assigned to the move order, exceeds a threshold or not, one obtains the one-box outcome or the two-box outcome, respectively. The findings are extended to an agent with arbitrary increasing utility, featuring in general two thresholds. All solutions require only minimal assumptions about the being's payoffs, and the being is always sure to predict the agent's choice in equilibrium. The relevant Nash equilibria are subgame-perfect, except for risk-seeking agents where for intermediate beliefs, the being may be unable to ensure perfect prediction without relying on noncredible threats. Lastly, analogies of Newcomb's problem to the commitment problem on a continuum are discussed.","[Weber, Thomas A.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CDM ODY 3-01,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Weber, TA (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CDM ODY 3-01,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",thomas.weber@epfl.ch,"Weber, Thomas A./C-3892-2018","Weber, Thomas A./0000-0003-2857-4754",,,,,47,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2016,81.0,3,,,,,339,356,,10.1007/s11238-016-9543-2,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DX7PW,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384581700003,0

This approach encounters problems when (1) sales are infrequent or (2) when these differ systematically from the overall market (selection bias). Relative to the number of properties sold on the market, a much greater number of properties have borrowers who need to make monthly mortgage payment decisions. Therefore, each month borrowers cast a vote of confidence or no confidence in their price relative to the loan balance. Based on this behavior, we invert the relation between mortgage performance and prices to derive a latent price index. Using a large sample of individual mortgages across the 10 cities investigated, the latent index in each city has a high correlation with the respective Case-Shiller index. In addition, the latent index is partially explained by the housing expectations (derived from futures on the respective Case-Shiller index) which indicates that it is not a purely reactive measure. Overall the results show that the latent index has potential to boost information resources for tracking the important real estate sector.","[Pace, R.

Evidence from late-modern military revolutions in Europe and North America,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WAR; STATE; DEMOCRACY; REVENUES; TAXATION; WARFARE,"Warfare and military competition have been defined as important driving forces for the expansion of fiscal capacity during late-modern times. However, the empirical evidence remains inconclusive, and we still lack a historical narrative that explains how warfare has affected the evolution of late-modern fiscal systems. This article aims to fill this gap by analysing the effects of warfare on fiscal development in the light of the so-called Revolutions in Military Affairs that took place in Western countries since the mid-nineteenth century to the present. The results suggest that the interplay between warfare and fiscal expansion has followed an inverted U-shape pattern, in which changes in military tactics and technology have pushed public revenues up until the destructive power has passed the nuclear threshold level. Additionally, the results pose that politics is relevant to complete this war-led narrative.","[Sanate, Oriol] Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist Econ Inst Polit & Econ Mundial, Espai Recerca Econ, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona, Spain; [Sanate, Oriol] Univ Leicester, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Sanaté, O (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist Econ Inst Polit & Econ Mundial, Espai Recerca Econ, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona, Spain.;Sanaté, O (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",oriol.sabate@ub.edu,,"Sabate, Oriol/0000-0001-6533-8174",,,,,49,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Neoliberalism has transformed social and financial relations in Europe but it has not given rise to a sustained profit-led growth process. Instead, growth has relied either on financial bubbles and rising household debt ('debt-driven growth') or on net exports ('export-driven growth'). In Europe the financial crisis has been amplified by an economic policy architecture (the Stability and Growth Pact) that aimed at restricting the role of fiscal policy and monetary policy. This neoliberal economic policy regime in conjunction with the separation of monetary and fiscal spheres has turned the financial crisis of 2007 into a sovereign debt crisis in southern Europe.","[Stockhammer, Engelbert] Univ Kingston, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",e.stockhammer@kingston.ac.uk,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",,,,,65,74,81,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The traditional harvest method involves burning the field to facilitate access to the canes, resulting in well-documented negative effects on health. The existing studies do not consider the effects on health in the surrounding areas. This article presents a new variety of a spatial diff-in-diff model to control for the effects of sugarcane production in neighboring non-producing regions. This method is an addition to the Spatial Econometrics literature, as it includes spatial effects on treated and untreated regions, so that the effects on both producing and surrounding non-producing regions can be properly estimated. The results indicate that the effects on the producing regions are 78% larger than if the effects on the surrounding areas were ignored. Moreover, the effects on the surrounding areas, typically ignored in other studies, are relevant, and almost as large as the effects on the producing areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings suggest that age is positively associated, but at a diminishing rate, with driving when health and functional limitations are controlled for; women have lower propensities than men for driving; those who drive have higher overall mobility; driving is negatively associated with mixed land uses near home; housing tenure (duration in years) is positively associated with driving. Weather-related variables are not statistically significant, but this does not diminish the potentially significant impacts of extreme weather events on mobility among older adults.

The article argues that the European Commission requires professional networks to advance the European Union (EU) acquis in Morocco and Algeria regarding climate change mitigation. However, certain conditions determine its network-building efforts outside Europe. Functional interests and sectoral interdependence provide the Commission with increased bargaining power in Morocco. Thus, market access and expertise offers trigger Morocco to develop technical dialogue over renewable energies. Instead, a Commission-led technical network over renewable energies creates antagonistic relations with the Algerian state elite. An alternative energy relationship with Europe beyond conventional resources could incur revenue losses for the state and a shift towards a different economic model. As a result, state hierarchies intervene in network-building and lead professionals to stagnant outcomes.

Analyses are performed using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor along with the Visual Analogue Scale of the EQ-5D-5L instrument as an overall health rating. The results show that business owners are healthier than wage-workers, which is in line with the findings from studies in developed countries. Furthermore, better health is associated with a lower likelihood for fear of business failure to be a deterrent to new business formation, a greater likelihood of self belief in having the skills to run a business, and an increased recognition of start-up business opportunities among wage-workers. These positive associations between health and entrepreneurial perceptions provide new evidence about why less healthy individuals refrain from entrepreneurship. Finally, we find that the healthiest business owners run the companies with the highest growth expectations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The unobserved components are trend inflation and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). Our model also incorporates a time-varying Phillips curve and time-varying inflation persistence. What sets this paper apart from the existing literature is that we do not use unbounded random walks for the unobserved components, but rather bounded random walks. For instance, NAIRU is assumed to evolve within bounds. Our empirical work shows the importance of bounding. We find that our bounded bivariate model forecasts better than many alternatives, including a version of our model with unbounded unobserved components. Our model also yields sensible estimates of trend inflation, NAIRU, inflation persistence and the slope of the Phillips curve. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Chan, Joshua C.

On the other hand, our forecast combination methods are benchmarked with a simple average and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The statistical performance of our models is estimated throughout the period of 1972-2012, using the last 7 years for out-of-sample testing. The results show that the radial basis function neural network statistically outperforms all models' individual performances. The forecast combinations are successful, since both Kalman filter and support vector regression techniques improve the statistical accuracy. Finally, support vector regression is found to be the superior model of the forecasting competition.

In many countries, statutory rates, the number of tax brackets, and the incidence of tax allowances have been reduced for income taxes; in the developing world, international liberalization has also been associated with reduced revenues from trade taxes and increased pressures for expansion of the value added tax and income tax revenue intake. Yet, competition for mobile assets and new opportunities for tax avoidance potentially constrains taxation of corporate and personal income. Thus, contemporary conditions create especially severe challenges for the pursuit of greater income equality and enhanced public goods provision in developing nations. The present paper situates this special issue's contributions within the theoretical and empirical literatures that seek to explain contemporary changes in taxation. I argue that we know quite a lot about the tax effects of globalization, domestic politics, and their interaction in rich democracies; we know much less about how international forces and domestic factors influence tax reforms in the developing world. In this context, I highlight how each paper in this volume contributes to our understanding of the impacts of globalization and domestic politics on tax policy choices and, in turn, the challenges and opportunities for revenue mobilization in developing nations.","[Swank, Duane] Marquette Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Marquette University,"Swank, D (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",,,,"Graduate School; Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences, Marquette University","Graduate School; Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences, Marquette University","Graduate School; Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences, Marquette University.",,71,23,25,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We focus on recent developments in the FTI certification system, including the split of Fair Trade USA from FTI and the emergence of the Small Producer's Symbol (SPP) as an alternative to FTI certification. We highlight the role of the three regional Producer Networks, in particular the Latin American Producer Network, the CLAC, in the politics and governance of the FTI system. In order to analyse these issues we employ an alternative reading of Karl Polanyi's work in relation to Fair Trade. We problematise the claim made by some in the literature that FTI certification is an example of Polanyi's concept of re-embedding. Instead, we draw on Polanyi's concept of oversight to analyse Fair Trade certification.

The first implementations of the egalitarian equivalence criterion follow an approach where the preferences are captured at the group level (based on socio-demographic variables) rather than at the individual level. Our contribution is to extend these models by using information on individual preferences, derived from the potential discrepancy between the group level optimal choice and the revealed choice of the individuals. We implement and compare the conditional equality and egalitarian equivalence criteria on a 2004 US microeconomic dataset and find that these criteria are relatively consistent in the identification of the worst-off. We also show that up to 18 % of the worst-off are no longer categorized as worst-off when the empirical approach accounts for individual preferences.","[Carpantier, Jean-Francois] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Sapata, Christelle] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Luxembourg; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Carpantier, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",jf.carpantier@gmail.com; chrissapata@gmail.com,"Carpantier, Jean-François/H-5786-2012","Carpantier, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-2620-2503",,,,,25,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2016,46.0,3,,,,,521,542,,10.1007/s00355-015-0927-y,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020900004,0

Earlier works, such as McFadden (Frontier in econometrics, 1973), Yellott (J Math Psychol 15:109-144, 1977), and Strauss (J Math Psychol 20:35-52, 1979) have discussed random utility representations under the assumption that utilities are additively (or multiplicatively) separable in a deterministic and a random part. Under various conditions, they have established that a separable and independent random utility representation exists if and only if the random terms are type III (type I) extreme value distributed. This paper analyzes independent random utility representations without the separability condition and with an infinite universal set of alternatives. Under these assumptions, it turns out that the most general random utility representation of the Luce model is a utility function that is an arbitrary strictly increasing transformation of a separable utility function (additive or multiplicative) with extreme value distributed random terms.","[Dagsvik, John K.] Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Dagsvik, JK (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",john.dagsvik@ssb.no,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2016,80.0,3,,,,,495,499,,10.1007/s11238-014-9479-3,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DG7OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372272800010,0

Better performance of the Bayesian network model is particularly salient with class imbalance, higher dimensions and a rejection sample.

The results from the empirical models suggest that the wage premia associated with high housing costs and long commutes are substantial.

Advanced countries specialized in the generation and exploitation of knowledge because of its relative abundance stemming from their sophisticated knowledge governance mechanisms and the large stock of knowledge. In turn, this had strong positive effects on total factor productivity. The empirical analysis confirms that in advanced economies the specialization in knowledge-based activities substituted for the previous specialization in mass manufacturing activities supporting the increase of total factor productivity. The new specialization in knowledge-intensive activities has been stronger in cases where patent activities have been more intense and the exposure to international trade and the revenue per capita have been larger.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Turin, Coll Carlo Alberto, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Fassio, Claudio] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Lund University,"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023",,European Union [266959],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under Grant Agreement No. 266959.",,34,9,11,1,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The long lasting discussion on the appropriate collective decision mechanism is based on the merits of the rules consistent with these two approaches. Focusing on conformity with qualified majority, we propose single-approval multiple-rejection (SAMR) as a plausible flexible scoring rule narrowing the gap between the two approaches. Given k alternatives, such a mechanism permits approval of a single alternative and rejection of at most (k - 2) alternatives allowing any relative significance of the approved vs. the rejected alternatives. SAMR is the unique type of rule that spans the whole spectrum of the qualified majority-based utilitarian rules, independent of k. Our first characterization result exposes the relationship between its consistency with any predetermined a-majority based rule, alpha > 1/2, and the best/worst (approval/rejection) relative weight p. Our second result establishes that the plurality rule is the unique scoring rule consistent with any alpha-majority, alpha < 1/2. These results imply the impossibility of universal scoring-rule consistency with any ideal or real alpha-majority.","[Baharad, Eyal; Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",baharad@biu.ac.il; nitzans@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2016,46.0,2,,,,,287,299,,10.1007/s00355-015-0913-4,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020700003,0

This way, there is a need to develop more efficient and inexpensive methods of collecting information about citizens' travel patterns. In this line, this paper presents a generic methodology that allows to infer the origin and destination zones for an observed trip between two public transport stops (i.e., bus stops or metro stations) using socioeconomic, land use, and network information. The proposed zonal inference model follows a disaggregated Logit approach including size variables. The model enables the estimation of a zonal origin-destination matrix for a city, if trip information passively collected by a smart-card payment system is available (in form of a stop-to-stop matrix). The methodology is applied to the Santiago de Chile's morning peak period, with the purpose of serving as input for a public transport planning computational tool. To estimate the model, information was gathered from different sources and processed into a unified framework; data included a survey conducted at public transport stops, land use information, and a stop to -stop trip matrix. Additionally, a zonal system with 1176 zones was constructed for the city, including the definition of its access links and associated distances. Our results shows that, ceteris paribus, zones with high numbers of housing units have higher probabilities of being the origin of a morning peak trip. Likewise, health facilities, educational, residential, commercial, and offices centres have significant attraction powers during this period. In this sense, our model manages to capture the expected effects of land use on trip generation and attraction. This study has numerous policy implications, as the information obtained can be used to predict the impacts of changes in the public transport network (such as extending routes, relocating their stops, designing new routes or changing the fare structure). Further research is needed to improve the zonal inference formulation and origin-destination matrix estimation, mainly by including better cost measures, and dealing with survey and data limitations.

In a crowdfunding campaign, a seller solicits financial contributions from a crowd, usually in the form of pre-buying an unrealized product, and commits to producing the product if the total amount pledged is above a certain threshold. We provide a model of crowdfunding in which consumers arrive sequentially and make decisions about whether to pledge or not. Pledging is not costless, and hence consumers would prefer not to pledge if they think the campaign will not succeed. This can lead to cascades where a campaign fails to raise the required amount even though there are enough consumers who want the product. The paper introduces a novel stochastic process - anticipating random walks-to analyze this problem. The analysis helps explain why some campaigns fail and some do not, and provides guidelines about how sellers should design their campaigns in order to maximize their chances of success. More broadly, Anticipating Random Walks can also find application in settings where agents make decisions sequentially and these decisions are not just affected by past actions of others, but also by how they will impact the decisions of future actors as well.","[Alaei, Saeed] Google Res, Mountain View, CA USA; [Malekian, Azarakhsh] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Mostagir, Mohamed] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Google Incorporated; University of Toronto; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Alaei, S (通讯作者)，Google Res, Mountain View, CA USA.",,,,,,,,0,15,17,0,19,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,363,363,,10.1145/2940716.2940777,0.0,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300031,0

As will be demonstrated later, by such mechanisms, among others, we may mean leadership and internal marketing, which in the case of project-oriented management should get a substantial transformation and thus become important factor for sustainable development of the enterprise. The result of empirical researches is a conceptual model of the management of sustainable development through a combination of operational management and project-oriented management.

This article aims to analyze the design and use of nonlinear modification of BCWS (Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled) parameter within EVM (Earned Value Management) for monitoring project planned progress respecting human factor impact on the actual work effort. Duration of project activities is very often measured by the EVM tools, where the BCWS is a key parameter. Because BCWS is derived from the work effort in a project, work effort has a hidden influence on EVM. Consequently, in the real world of human resources, the BCWS is not usually linear. To express the BCWS parameters, Non-Linear mathematical models are used in this paper, describing the course of different work contours incorporating the Student Syndrome phenomenon. The human agent impact is apparent especially in the work contours of the resources allocated to the project. At the same time, the human agent impact manifests itself in the form of the Student Syndrome phenomenon. Hence, planning and progress of the project is burdened by the variability of the resources work effort affected by both different work contours and the Student Syndrome phenomenon.

We trace causal mechanisms whereby a cause (or set of causes) produces an outcome to both: (1) make stronger evidence-based inferences about causal relationships because the analysis produces within-case evidence of each step of the causal process (or absence thereof) in between a cause and outcome, and (2) because tracing mechanisms gives us a better understanding of how a cause produces an outcome. Yet, when we look at the methodological literature on PT, there is considerable ambiguity and discord about what causal mechanisms actually are. The result of this ambiguity and discord about what mechanisms are clearly maps onto existing applications of PT, with most PT case studies completely ignoring the underlying theoretical causal processes. In the few PT applications where mechanisms are unpacked, they are typically only developed in a very cursory fashion, with the result that there is considerable ambiguity about what theoretical process the ensuing case study actually is tracing. If we want to claim we are tracing causal mechanisms, the causal processes in between X and Y need to be unpacked theoretically. How can we claim we are tracing a causal 'process' when we are not told what the process (i.e. mechanism) actually is? To alleviate this problem, the article attempts to develop a clearer definition of causal mechanisms to provide scholars with a framework for theorising mechanisms in a fashion that is amenable to in-depth empirical analysis using PT.","[Beach, Derek] Univ Aarhus, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Beach, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aarhus, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.",derek@ps.au.dk,,"Beach, Derek/0000-0003-1869-0145",,,,,39,67,87,3,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

L-moments, having been introduced as a robust alternative to classical moments of probability distributions, provide some theoretical advantages over conventional moments. However, L-moments and their estimations lack some robust features associated with TL-moments that represent an alternative robust version of the former, called trimmed L-moments. This paper focuses on the use of TL-moments in the construction of models of the wage distribution. Three-parametric lognormal curves represent the basic theoretical distribution whose parameters were estimated simultaneously by three methods of point parameter estimation - those of TL-moments, L-moments and maximum likelihood in combination with Cohen's method, their accuracy being then evaluated. 328 wage distributions formed the subject of the research, whose purpose is to highlight the advantages of the trimmed L-moment method over the classical method of L-moments in its application to economic data, namely in modelling the wage distribution. Another objective of the research is to verify the higher accuracy of the classical L-moments method compared to the maximum likelihood one, despite the latter being considered one of the most accurate parameter estimation methods. Both the higher accuracy of the trimmed L-moments method in comparison to that of L-moments and advantages of the latter over the maximum likelihood method have been demonstrated.","[Bilkova, Diana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",diana.bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,30,43,,,,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100004,0

Disciplinary barriers between social disciplines are nonetheless repeatedly challenged by attempts to cross boundaries and hybridization processes. In economics, we can detect two distinct methodological practices - an imperialistic one and a pluralistic one. The former aims at interdisciplinarity in a limited range of hybridization. The latter supports more possibilities, feasible with the evolution of disciplines, but it remains largely mono-disciplinary. In this respect the aims of this paper are twofold: (1) to show that, unlike natural sciences, there are no ontological reasons for disciplinary divisions in the social sciences; and (2) to outline some implications of all this, by contrasting the pluralism project in heterodox economics and the parochial methodology of economic imperialism. There is a tendency among economists to fear overmuch for the integrity of their science and to try to maintain its borders intact by carefully avoiding encroachment on the fields of other sciences. Specialization has its advantages, as the economist has good occasion to know, but unorganized specialization means confusion instead of co-operation.","[Chafim, Fernando] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Chafim, F (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Econ, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",fernandochafim@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The only form of taxation, which, in our opinion, can contribute to an optimal attracting foreign capital (that includes the investment in knowledge, production technology and innovation), is the corporate tax. Certainly, it is not devoid of weaknesses in its structure (especially in developing countries), but it only imposes the need for its reform in order constituting the optimal tax structure. The problems that its implementation carries in domestic law (complexity and lack of transparency) and international law (the problem of unfair tax competition and legal illegitimate tax evasion) are complex, but not irresolvable. The thesis of the so-called the inappropriateness of tax incentives in modern tax law must be seriously reconsider, because in the conditions of financial crises tax incentives can be an effective tool for the long-term economic policies of developing countries (such as Serbia). The structure of the tax incentive was determined in the function of stimulating economic growth, development of small enterprises and employment. In order for tax incentives to be effective, it is essential that their incorporation into legal norms provide that they act as automatic stabilizers, as this reduces investment uncertainty, administrative costs and favouring less profitable investments. In the area of corporate taxation in Serbia, tax incentives are usually seen as intention of the legislator to encourage capital investment in certain area. The abolition of tax credit in Serbian tax law will affects the overall level of investment in the country and prevents the undermining already undertaken investment projects. In addition, it remains unclear how these changes will affect the location of the tax base and changes firms' legal status (mergers, divisions and joint ventures agreements).","[Dimitrijevic, Marko] Univ Nis, Fac Law, Nish, Serbia",University of Nis,"Dimitrijevic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Law, Nish, Serbia.",markod1985@prafak.ni.ac.rs,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,210,218,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400021,0

The earnings equations were estimated controlling the source of sample selection bias when using Heckman maximum likelihood procedure with the main Mincerian earnings equation, while the selection equation is a probit estimate of the probability to be employed rather than unemployed. We tested the hypothesis that educational and job mismatched workers earn less due to their lower competencies and skills in relative terms. We estimated earnings penalties associated to job and educational mismatches controlling for sample selection. The earnings penalty associated to educational / job mismatch is equal to 32.2 % and. 8.2 %, respectively. This finding supports the hypothesis there is positive selection into employment of the most skilled among workers whose individual characteristics are less on demand on the labour market.","[Dlouha, Zuzana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dlouhá, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",zuzana.dlouha@vse.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,155,159,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500027,0

Natural character of mortality begins to prevail at higher ages (approximately 60 years and higher). But especially at very high ages we can observe significant deviations in mortality. That is why it is important to smooth mortality curve for obtaining better results. Due to the aging population it is very important to have the best imagination about development of mortality at the highest ages. In this paper will be presented methodology which is used for modelling of the intensity of mortality by the Czech Statistical Office. These results will be compared with the methodology which use the modified Gompertz-Makeham function.

While the free movement of people guarantees to any natural person who is a national of a Member State of the European Union to work and be employed in another Member State under the same conditions as nationals of that State, in the light of freedom to provide services the possibility to work in another Member State as a posted worker was established. The free movement of workers is limited by the workers'rights arising from the social systems coordination rules as defined in Regulation 1408/07 and Regulation 88/2004. These Regulations are generally based on the principle lex loci laboris by which the workers'rights are defined by the Member State law where the work is performed, with the exception of the posted workers. The applicable law to posted workers is that of their home Member State from which workers are sent to perform a service for their employer. In this sense, the possibility to achieve a more flexible cross-border movement of workers is the possibility of posting workers in another EU Member State by an employer in order to provide service while being protected by the home Member State law regarding social and other rights that are defined by their working contract. The right of the employer to post workers in another Member State is governed by the provisions of Directive 96/71/EC which essentially determines the rights of employees to work in another Member State. Posted workers actually represent the realization of the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment where their rights still remain doubtful in comparison with rights guaranteed by the free movement of workers. The posted workers rules de facto represent an exception to the application of the coordination procedure regulated between different social security schemes in the Member States and an exception to the rules for the application of national law of the Member State in which the work is performed. In the paper the author analyses the rights and obligations of workers and employers arising from the Directive 96/71/EC and its amendments introduced by the implementing Directive 2014/67/EU. It is the Directive 2014/67/EU, which was adopted after more than 20 years, that is conceived as a guarantor of protecting the rights of posted workers. The article discusses the scope and possibilities of implementation of the provisions of this directive in practice of the Member States, as well as future developments in this area with a special analysis of the relationship of these directives and directives governing the coordination of social systems in the Member States.

Understanding how such social cascades spread in a network is crucial for many applications ranging from viral marketing to political campaigns. The behavior of cascade depends crucially on the model of cascade or social influence and the topological structure of the social network. In this paper we study the general threshold model of cascades which are parameterized by a distribution over the natural numbers, in which the collective influence from infected neighbors, once beyond the threshold of an individual u, will trigger the infection of u. By varying the choice of the distribution, the general threshold model can model cascades with and without the submodular property. In fact, the general threshold model captures many previously studied cascade models as special cases, including the independent cascade model, the linear threshold model, and k-complex contagions. We provide both analytical and experimental results for how cascades from a general threshold model spread in a general growing network model, which contains preferential attachment models as special cases. We show that if we choose the initial seeds as the early arriving nodes, the contagion can spread to a good fraction of the network and this fraction crucially depends on the fixed points of a function derived only from the specified distribution. We also show, using a coauthorship network derived from DBLP databases and the Stanford web network, that our theoretical results can be used to predict the infection rate up to a decent degree of accuracy, while the configuration model does the job poorly.","[Gao, Jie; Ghasemiesfeh, Golnaz] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Schoenebeck, Grant; Yu, Fang-Yi] Univ Michigan, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Gao, J (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",jgao@cs.stonybrook.edu; gghasemiesfe@cs.stonybrook.edu; schoeneb@umich.edu; fayu@umich.edu,,"Yu, Fang-Yi/0000-0002-3697-8807; Schoenebeck, Grant/0000-0001-6878-0670",Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1452915] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,30,5,9,1,6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,617,634,,10.1145/2940716.2940778,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300051,0

A simple illustrative comparison of both approaches (RCIM vs. GAMMI) was conducted on Poisson counting data of 4 rows x 5 columns. The defiance analysis was provided by log-likelihood of the model and ones of the residual. Deviance analysis will provide a way to determine the complexity of interaction component in the model, named by rank of model. The Biplot of both approaches seem not quite different. Finally, we did show that RCIMs be relied upon to fit well the GAMMI model and then applied it in an illustrative example to a real dataset.

To this end, we use numerical modelling and apply the Global Gas Model. We investigate three pathways of future natural gas consumption: i) a decreasing natural gas consumption, following the scenarios of the EU Energy Roadmap 2050; ii) a moderate increase of natural gas consumption, along the lines of the IEA's New Policies Scenario; and iii) a temporary increase of natural gas use as a bridge technology, followed by a strong decrease after 2030. Our results show that current import infrastructure and intra-European transit capacity are sufficient to accommodate future import needs in all scenarios. This is despite a pronounced reduction of domestic production and a strong increase in import dependency. However, due to strong demand in Asia, Europe must increasingly rely on exports from Africa and the Caspian region, leading to new infrastructure capacity from these regions. When natural gas serves as a bridge technology, short-term utilisation rates of LNG import capacity temporarily increase instead of instigating large scale pipeline expansions.","[Holz, Franziska; Richter, Philipp M.] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Richter, Philipp M.] Dresden Univ Technol TU Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Dresden, Germany; [Egging, Ruud] NTNU Ind Econ & Technol Management, Trondheim, Norway",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technische Universitat Dresden; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Holz, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",fholz@diw.de,"Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/AAF-3005-2020","Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/0000-0002-5061-636X",German Ministry of Education and Research; Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies-FME CenSES from the Research Council of Norway [209697],German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies-FME CenSES from the Research Council of Norway,"We thank Hanna Brauers, Daniela Griese and Daniel Huppmann for research assistance and/or comments on the paper, and three anonymous referees for very detailed remarks.

We use the contingency and institutional theories to explain the background. The conclusion of our research implies that the changes in the management accounting system of the Czech companies took place in the same time with the institutionalisation of some of its elements, which were based already in the previous regime and newly modified with opening of the country and internationalization of economic flows. Corporations 'management accounting systems were modelled by contingencies. The results show that there is only minor impact of the IFRS implementation process on managerial accounting in the Czech Republic but management accounting on its own has a long tradition and even nowadays it helps to solve practical in-company problems and provides approaches to increase the firm value. The practical in-company problems are based on particular firm's contingencies stemming for management style and ownership structure of each specific business.","[Jindrichovska, Irena] Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Kubickova, Dana] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Jindrichovská, I (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 1, Czech Republic.",irena.jindrichovska@seznam.cz; dana.kubickova@centrum.cz,"Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019; Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013",,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,745,754,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100074,0

Contrary to prior research on the impact of mass media, in this experiment government agents do not provide greater benefits to citizens whose exposure to community radio increased their demand for those benefits. Households with greater access to community radio were more likely to pay for government-provided bed nets to combat malaria than to receive them for free. Mass media changed the private behavior of citizens-they invested more of their own resources in the public health good of bed nets-but not citizens' ability to extract greater benefits from government. While the welfare consequences of these results are ambiguous, the pattern of radio's effects that we uncover has implications for policy strategies to use mass media for development objectives.","[Keefer, Philip] IADB, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Khemani, Stuti] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; The World Bank,"Keefer, P (通讯作者)，IADB, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",pkeefer@iadb.org; skhemani@worldbank.org,,,Knowledge for Change Program,Knowledge for Change Program,"We thank Peter Lanjouw and the two anonymous referees.

However, promoting students into grades for which they are not prepared may backfire, leading to early dropouts. An econometric decomposition of promotion decisions into a component that is based on merit (attendance and achievement in tests) and another component that is uncorrelated with those indicators allows a test of whether parental decisions to keep their child in school is influenced by merit-based or nonmerit-based promotions. Results suggest that the enrollment decision is significantly influenced by whether learning has taken place. The effect of grade promotions uncorrelated with merit on persistence in school is only 20 to 33 percent as large as the effect attributed to merit-based promotion.","[King, Elizabeth M.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Paterno, Elizabeth M.] Govt Ontario, Minist Community & Social Serv, Toronto, ON, Canada",Brookings Institution; Iowa State University,"King, EM (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",bethking1818@gmail.com; pfo@iastate.edu; Elizabeth.Paterno@ontario.ca,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089; King, Elizabeth M./0000-0003-3609-1736",World Bank; Economics Department of Iowa State University,World Bank(The World Bank India); Economics Department of Iowa State University,"Useful comments on earlier versions of this paper from Felipe Barrera-Osorio, Halsey Rogers, Guilherme Sedlacek, and participants at meetings of the Population Association of America and the Midwest Economics Association are gratefully acknowledged.

The data indicate the existence of problems in the implementation of the principles of Islamic finance though in terms of prospects it has big potential. Islamic economic principles which have inherent values of justice, divinity, freedom and responsibility, should be the right system in a democratic economy for the economic empowerment of the poor. Some of the reasons for its slow implementation, based on field analysis are first, people are still accustomed to a conventional system that has been around longer; second, Islamic financial institutions are not ready to completely adopt the Islamic financial system in particular Profit & Lost sharing (PLS); third, implementation of Islamic financial system tends to require relatively high operating costs.

We show that free allowances allocated to price-regulated firms effectively act as a subsidy to output, distort consumer choices, and generally induce higher output and emissions by price-regulated firms. This provides a cost-effectiveness argument for an auction-based allocation of allowances (or equivalently an emissions tax). For real-world economies such as the Unites States, in which about 20 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions are generated by price-regulated electricity producers, our quantitative analysis suggests that free allowances increase economy-wide welfare costs of the policy by 40-80 percent relative to an auction. Given large disparities in regional welfare impacts, we show that the inefficiencies are mainly driven by the emissions intensity of electricity producers in regions with a high degree of price regulation.","[Lanz, Bruno] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Econ, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ctr Int Environm Studies, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Integrat Risk Management & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] ETH Zurich CER ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rausch, Sebastian] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Econ, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@graduateinstitute.ch; srausch@ethz.ch,,"Rausch, Sebastian/0000-0002-6379-8406",,,,,62,10,10,1,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2016,37.0,1,,,,,195,232,,10.5547/01956574.37.1.blan,0.0,,,38,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DA2OD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367634800009,0

If the resulting time series show presence of a unit-root, it has far reaching consequences for tourism policy making, as shocks (policies) can have permanent effects on the tourism. For that purpose we test the seasonally adjusted time-series for the presence of a unit root, through the KPSS stationary test with two breaks using monthly data from 2003 to 2015, and allowing for the presence of deterministic structural breaks. We show, that taking account structural breaks in time-series of tourism activity might be crucial when deciding whether the series is stationary or not. First, our results have suggested, that the first breaks occurred around the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 (except Slovak Republic). The second break in the series occurred latter, after the economies started to make a fast recovery. Second, when structural breaks were not taken into account, we found that each of the tourism activities appears to be non-stationary.","[Lyocsa, Stefan] Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Lyocsa, Stefan; Litavcova, Eva; Vasanicova, Petra] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov,"Lyócsa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.;Lyócsa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Presov, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia.",stefan.lyocsa@gmail.com; eva.litavcova@unipo.sk; petra.vasanicova@smail.unipo.sk,"Lyocsa, Stefan/ABE-7961-2021; Litavcova, Eva/JAN-6178-2023; Vasanicova, Petra/AAS-3645-2020; Litavcova, Eva/Q-3792-2018; Vasanicova, Petra/D-4573-2018","Lyocsa, Stefan/0000-0002-8380-181X; Vasanicova, Petra/0000-0001-7353-2057; Litavcova, Eva/0000-0002-5323-4359; Vasanicova, Petra/0000-0001-7353-2057",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1091,1098,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100108,0

Corruption is an institutional dysfunction caused by the relationship between private and governmental sector consisting of an act of abuse of power by governmental employees for the purpose of private gain. Corruption was, until recently, mainly analysed as an independent variable. We permit for endogeneity of both variables when regressing the composite index of perception of freedom from corruption against the composite index of property rights enforcement. The choice of variables and the model follows from the theoretical background of the Economic analysis of law and property rights literature.

The analysis is based on the data retrieved from the UN Comtrade Database. Africa is more significant trading partner for the European Union than Latin America. During analysed 15 years, the value of the EU's bilateral trade with Africa was 1.5 bigger than with Latin American countries. The average annual growth rate of trade with Africa was higher than with Latin America. However, the EU faster increased its trade with Latin American countries than with Africa after the outbreak of the global financial crisis. Africa and Latin America were mainly the EU's import market but the EU had a surplus in trade with Latin American countries in the years 2013-2014. The European Union is a major trading partner for Africa. It increased its advantage over the US in trade with the African continent but it has been steadily losing its advantage over China. Since 2010, China has been more significant trading partner for Africa's 34 least developed countries than the EU. The European Union is still the second (after the US) important trading partner for Latin America. However, China's trade with South America surpassed the EU's one in 2014.

Stress is an inevitable part of human activity. The factors that cause it are called stressors. Stress can cause the development of serious illnesses (anxiety, depression, reduced functioning of the immune system). When it comes to the workplace, and today it is often the case, workers are insecure, which is an indicator of stress. Sudden changes in the workplace, necesity of performing additional tasks at home, burnout syndrome, insufficient holidays and low wages is what affects the mental health of workers. This leads to anxiety, concentration problems, constant fatigue, social isolation, bitterness and finally taking psychoactive substances. Work then becomes a heavy burden for worker.

Or did economic growth trigger these infrastructure developments? To answer these questions, we develop a simple model of production capacity constraints and use China's Western Development Strategy (WDS) as an example to investigate how the relationships among energy investment, transportation infrastructure expansion and economic growth differ in the pre- and post-WDS periods. Our Granger causality analysis uses a panel data sample for China's 30 provinces in the Western and non-Western regions for the period of 1991-2012. We find Granger causality only in the post-WDS period from transportation infrastructure expansion to economic growth and from economic growth to energy investment.

Two possible causes are the poor's lack of local access to financial institutions and low capability to solve poverty. Riau provincial government has introduced a community-based microfinance institution called Village Empowerment Program which includes economic empowerment, to be organized by local people. To ensure that the new local institutions are effective and community empowerment is achieved, the government appointed pendamping desa (village mentor). This study aims to understand the role of pendamping desa in empowering local community and institutions through communication approach. Method: This research focuses on four different parts in Riau province. Data were collected through interviews with six informants who directly involved with the UED-SP program. Results: Pendamping Desa are university graduates who are recommended by village leaders to be selected, appointed, trained by the provincial government and placed in areas close to their areas of origin. Communication skills of pendamping desa becomes the most important factor in improving community acceptance and in implementing community empowerment, and they also became a bridge between elements of society and simultaneously drives the various activities to increase the capability of local communities and institution. A participatory approach is the most suitable technique in empowering community and building the UED-SP institution. Conclusion: Communication skill of pendamping desa plays a significant role in connecting all parties involved in community empowerment activities.","[Venus, Antar] Fac Commun, Dept Commun Management, Sumedang, Indonesia; [Siregar, Adiatma] Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Sumedang, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Venus, A (通讯作者)，Fac Commun, Dept Commun Management, Sumedang, Indonesia.",antar.venus@unpad.ac.id,"Siregar, Adiatma Y.M/AAB-9617-2021","Siregar, Adiatma Y.M/0000-0003-0747-1596",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-264-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,18.0,,,,,,162,168,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390913100025,0

To manage their risk, the company can use derivatives on emissions allowances (in particular futures and options), in addition to spot values of allowances. We solve the decision problem for the case of an real-life Czech steel company for different levels of risk aversion and different scenarios of the demand. We show that the necessity of emissions trading generally, and the risk caused by the trading in particular, can influence the production significantly even when the risk is decreased by means of derivatives. The results of the study show that even for low levels of the risk aversion, futures on allowances are optimal to use in order to reduce the risk caused by the emissions trading.","[Zapletal, Frantisek] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; [Smid, Martin] CAS, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Zapletal, F (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",fran-tisek.zapletal@vsb.cz; smid@utia.cas.cz,"Zapletal, František/AAL-7815-2020; Zapletal, Frantisek/C-6677-2018","Zapletal, Frantisek/0000-0002-3223-3138",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,916,921,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500157,0

The asymptotic distribution of the generalized forecast error variance decomposition components and the corresponding standard errors are also derived. Our empirical results, based on a data set covering a twelve-year period (2000-2012), suggest a high level of total return and volatility spillover effects throughout the sample period. Stock markets across the Euro area countries are identified as the main transmitters of price spillovers, with the periphery countries transmitting the largest amount of spillovers during the crisis periods. Stock markets also play a key role in uncertainty transmission, but now, the propagation mechanism includes the core Euro area countries, which transmit volatility spillovers diachronically. The money, FX and bond markets are constant receivers of spillovers, with the exception of the Greek bonds, which transmitted spillovers during the peak of the Greek sovereign debt crisis in 2011-2012.","Bank Greece, Financial Stabil Dept, Athens 10564, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Louzis, DP (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, Financial Stabil Dept, 3 Amerikis Str, Athens 10564, Greece.",dlouzis@aueb.gr,,,,,,,34,22,22,1,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Following a review of time allocation theories, a time allocation model for general travel behavior is proposed as a further elaboration of Evans' (1972) activities analysis. There are relationships among activities that can be expressed using a linear inequality to show the constraints on the arrangement of activities. This model indicates that two or more activities can be simultaneously rearranged to improve time management, which may be a source of variation in VTTS. This time allocation model can explain why large-scale high-speed rail construction in China faces significant market risks and a high likelihood of economic loss. Data from a new ticket sales and booking system for railway passengers indicate that passengers prefer conventional overnight sleeper trains, rather than high-speed trains, for long-distance travel, which supports the analysis of the time allocation model.

In 2009, when the crisis hit hardest, Lithuania saw its budget deficit expand substantially, while Estonia managed to keep the deficit under 3% of GDP and consequently was invited to join the Eurozone, to which it acceded in 2011. The experience of these countries presents an interesting puzzle, as the divergent fiscal performance cannot be attributed to purely economic factors. Both countries have a similar economic structure, and both were similarly affected by the crisis. Furthermore, both pursued similar expenditure and tax policies during the crisis. Based on quantitative and qualitative evidence, it is argued that higher tax compliance and subsequently higher tax revenues can explain the difference. In turn, this compliance gap can be attributed to different levels of trust in political institutions in Estonia and Lithuania.","[Kuokstis, Vytautas] Vilnius State Univ, Dept Sociol, Fac Philosophy, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kuokstis, Vytautas] Vilnius State Univ, Inst Int Relat & Polit Sci, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vilnius University,"Kuokstis, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Dept Sociol, Fac Philosophy, Vilnius, Lithuania.",kuokstis@gmail.com,"Kuokstis, Vytautas/ABF-6630-2020","Kuokstis, Vytautas/0000-0001-9455-9953",European Union Structural Fund project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan [VP1-3.1-SMM-01],European Union Structural Fund project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan,This work was supported by a Postdoctoral fellowship funded by European Union Structural Fund project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania within the framework of the Measure for Enhancing Mobility of Scholars and Other Researchers and the Promotion of Student Research [VP1-3.1-SMM-01] of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan.,,21,9,9,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

It argues that - counter to notions of state-led internationalization - the going abroad of NOCs reflects a pattern of coopetition,' i.e., the co-existence of cooperation and conflict between increasingly entrepreneurial NOCs and partially supportive and interventionist home governments. In China, the state has predominantly assumed the role of resource supplier, rarely stepping in as a veto player. In India, the NOC-government relationship has been more adversarial, with the state intervening more often as a veto player than its Chinese counterpart and only slowly emerging as a resource supplier. These patterns of internationalization can be explained by how two major trends have been playing out in the two countries: (1) the marketization of NOCs, and (2) the reform of the governance of overseas investments. The findings matter to theory and policy. First, they unpack the relational dynamics of business-government relations in hybrid models of capitalism beyond notions of top-down and bottom-up dynamics. Second, our analysis shows that the state intervenes in the international energy strategies of emerging economies as the occasional veto player rather than actively leveraging NOC internationalization for geopolitical goals.","[Meckling, Jonas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kong, Bo] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Int & Area Studies, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Madan, Tanvi] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Brookings Institution,"Meckling, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,74,24,27,3,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Hayek anticipated the notion of recursive utility' and analytically reconstructs his informal exposition of the optimal saving process. The scope of analysis is restricted to Hayek's largely unrecognised contribution in Utility Analysis and Interest in 1936, restated as chapters 17 and 18 in The Pure Theory of Capital, first published in 1941. It is shown that Hayek characterised efficient dynamic choice as an infinite series of two-period optimality conditions by transforming an infinite-horizon optimisation problem into a perpetual confrontation of current and prospective utility, that he hinted at the axiomatic base of stationary and weakly separable dynamic preferences, and that he endogenised the subjective discount rate to substantiate his claim that the interest-rate path in a perfect-foresight equilibrium is unidirectionally determined by the marginal productivity of investment (and not by thrift). Hayek's vision of dynamic social efficiency and dynamic equilibrium is completely characterised.","[Vassei, Arash Molavi] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Vasséi, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",arash.molavi.vassei@gmail.com,,,,,,,65,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

By using the proposed methodology, we can measure environmental technical efficiency, the shadow prices of emissions, and inter-factor substitution possibilities.

We discuss a model where consumers have preferences for the quality of a set of differentiated varieties. Firms do not only develop and sell manufacturing varieties in a monopolistic competitive market but also determine the quality level of their varieties by investing in research and development. We explore the price and quality equilibrium properties when firms are immobile. We then consider a footloose capital model where capital is allocated to the manufacturing firms in the region offering the highest return. We show that the larger region produces varieties of higher quality and that the quality gap increases with larger asymmetries in region sizes and with larger trade costs. Finally, the home market effect is mitigated when firms choose their product quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Picard, P.

More specifically, we examine networks of employer and employee organizations that participate in the Civil Society Forum of the Eastern Partnership and in TRESMED, a Mediterranean project. We find that networks are successful at disseminating principles and good practices of economic and social partnership, but also that dissemination proceeds slowly. In addition, we detect more co-operation among employer than among employee organizations, which reflects collective action difficulties facing organized labour more generally. Last, we find that inter-organizational co-operation is more intense in the Southern than in the Eastern neighbourhood, which is explained by contextual differences as well as by the EU's longer-term engagement with the Mediterranean than with the countries on its Eastern frontier.","[Turkina, Ekaterina] HEC Montrealrefere, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kourtikakis, Kostas] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Turkina, E (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Edifice Cote St Catherine 3000, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",ekaterina.turkina@hec.ca,,,European Center of Excellence at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,European Center of Excellence at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,The authors would like to thank two anonymous JCMS reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an active school attendance intervention tackling school dropout in Dutch secondary education. The intervention consists of increased care for, and interaction with, at-risk students by, for example, visits at home. It relies on professional mentors, teachers, case managers, social workers, and compulsory education age consultants. We analyze the effect of the intervention by a difference-in-differences analysis in combination with matching estimation techniques. The results indicate that the intervention schools significantly reduced school dropout with % points in the school year 2009-2010 compared to the control schools and the school year 2008-2009. The highest impact ( % points) of the intervention was estimated for the least able students.","[Cabus, Sofie J.; De Witte, Kristof] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [De Witte, Kristof] Univ Leuven KUL, Fac Econ & Business, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Maastricht University; KU Leuven,"Cabus, SJ (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",s.cabus@maastrichtuniversity.nl; kristof.dewitte@kuleuven.be,,"De Witte, Kristof/0000-0003-0505-8642",Platform31,Platform31,"We are grateful to LVO-group Limburg, Wiel Cals, Wim Groot, Henriette Maassen van den Brink, and TIER seminar participants, the two anonymous referees and the managing editor.

This study aims to identify the less well-known lifestyle along with more popular built environment as the main factors which shape travel behaviors. Employing data from 900 respondents of 22 urban areas in city of Shiraz, Iran, this paper explores travel behaviors as non-working trip frequencies by different modes. Results of structural equation model indicate a strong significant effect of individual's lifestyle patterns on their non-working trips. However, built environment impact on travel behavior is small compared to lifestyle. Besides, other variables such as travel attitudes and socio-economic factors stay crucial in the mode choice selection. These findings indicate the necessity of regarding lifestyle orientations in travel studies as well as objective factors such as land use attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have noted the problem of low power and size distortions in unit root tests, and spurious rejections that plague unit root tests which treat structural breaks asymmetrically. The proposed methodology used in this paper enables robust detection and estimation of breaks, and reliable inference regarding the presence of unit roots conditional on the presence or absence of breaks. We find that the periods of War, the Great Depression and oil price shocks to be possible reasons for the occurrence of breaks. The unit root test results indicate limited evidence of stochastic income convergence. We find none of the current upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries to show convergence, while high-income countries such as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and USA show signs of convergence toward the world average.","[Ghoshray, Atanu] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Khan, Faiza A.] Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, The Mall, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",Newcastle University - UK,"Ghoshray, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",Atanu.Ghoshray@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,3,3,1,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The study summarises the socio-demographic characteristics as well as the activity-travel behaviour of non-workers using a primary activity-travel survey data collected by the authors. Where possible, the research also compares the analysis findings with the case studies on activity-travel behaviour of non-workers, carried out in developed and developing countries. This gives an opportunity to understand the differences/similarities in the activity-travel behaviour of non-workers across diverse socio-cultural settings. The preliminary exploratory analysis shed light on the differences in activity participation, trip chaining, time-of-day preference for trip departure, and mode use behaviour of non-workers in Bangalore city. Statistical models were developed for investigating the effects of individual and household socio-demographics, land use parameters, and travel context attributes on activity participation, trip chaining, time-of-day choice, and mode choice decisions of non-workers. A few important results of the analysis are the influence of viewing television at home on out-of-home activity participation and trip-chaining behaviour, and the impact of in-home maintenance activity duration on time-of-day choice. Further, based on the findings of the initial analyses, an attempt has been made in this study to develop an integrated model that links time allocation, time-of-day choice, and trip chaining behaviour of non-workers. The study also discusses the implications of the research findings for transportation planning and policy for Bangalore city. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Many believe strategies to 'push' and 'pull' individuals out of private automobiles will reduce emissions and mitigate the need for parking. This study focuses on UC Berkeley's evaluation of a program that conducts targeted outreach to encourage shifts away from driving. The program provides customized information on commute alternatives, and is evaluated using descriptive as well as inferential statistics, focusing on effectiveness. Although the sample size is small, the findings show that a large component of program participants (8%) changed modes. Interviews with commuters evaluated potential barriers, including the adequacy, safety and convenience of alternatives. The study concluded that information alone is not adequate to draw individuals away from autos; other efforts to reach patrons must make driving alternatives easy and appealing. More research is needed on the interplay between outreach efforts and mode shift. Additional research and policy outcomes for urban campuses include: (1) a focus on information technology aided ride matching or carpooling; and (2) an increased focus on the telework environment. These strategies can assist urban campuses to refine comprehensive transportation demand management programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The increase in volatility spillovers after 2001 correlates with the progressive financialization of the commodities. Further, increasing spillovers from volatility among petroleum commodities substantially change their pattern after 2008 (the financial crisis and advent of tight oil production). After 2008, asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of total as well as directional spillovers. In terms of asymmetries we also show that overall volatility spillovers due to negative (price) returns materialize to a greater degree than volatility spillovers due to positive returns. An analysis of directional spillovers reveals that no petroleum commodity dominates other commodities in terms of general spillover transmission.","[Barunik, Jozef; Kocenda, Evzen; Vacha, Lukas] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18200, Czech Republic; [Barunik, Jozef; Kocenda, Evzen; Vacha, Lukas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Baruník, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18200, Czech Republic.",barunik@utia.cas.cz; kocenda@fsv.cuni.cz; vachal@utia.cas.cz,"Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Vacha, Lukas/G-6896-2014; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169; Vacha, Lukas/0000-0002-4032-3096; Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607",,,,,58,83,83,4,52,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3,,,,,309,329,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.jbar,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100014,0

Apart from economic and identity-based theories, there may also be a religious dimension that could help to explain why some countries are principally pro-European while others are largely eurosceptic. It is argued that differences between nations are embedded in historical alliances between Catholic and Protestant denominations and political systems. Hierarchical linear model analyses of data from the European Social Survey (ESS) show that: (1) citizens from Catholic countries are more likely to support European unification than the inhabitants of Protestant countries; and (2) this effect conditions the individual-level effect of welfare attitudes. This suggests that in Protestant countries support for welfare redistribution is associated with low support for the EU, while in Catholic countries support for welfare redistribution is associated with high support for the EU.","[Scherer, Margarete] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Scherer, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",margarete.scherer@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,42,8,8,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The tourism sector is captured through the proxy of 'tourism receipts'. In addition, investment and productivity growth are selected as sources of economic growth, in accordance with post-Keynesian growth theory. The paper uses time series quarterly data, covering the period 1995:Q1-2011:Q4, and employs time series estimation techniques, including structural vector autoregressive modelling and impulse response analysis, to describe the macroeconomic responses to sudden shocks in the tourism sector. The results indicate that the growth benefits of an increase in tourist expenditure are positive and statistically significant. Moreover, as suggested by the analysis of impulse response functions, a positive shock to tourist expenditure provides positive, substantial and rather long-lived implications regarding productivity and investment decisions.","[Chaiechi, Taha] James Cook Univ, Econ & Mkt Acad Grp, Coll Business Law & Governance, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Pryce, Josephine] James Cook Univ, Governence & Management Acad Grp, Coll Business Law & Governance, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Bhati, Abhishek] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Singapore, Singapore",James Cook University; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Chaiechi, T (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Econ & Mkt Acad Grp, Coll Business Law & Governance, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",taha.chaiechi@jcu.edu.au,"Bhati, Abhishek/P-9715-2015; Bhati, Abhishek/AAK-2754-2021; Pryce, Josephine/P-5739-2018; Chaiechi, Taha/M-2595-2018","Bhati, Abhishek/0000-0001-5890-8394; Pryce, Josephine/0000-0001-7211-0995; Chaiechi, Taha/0000-0002-9976-972X",,,,,21,3,3,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

To obtain more accurate results, the study adopted three improvements over previous research: consideration of both supply and demand; direct expenditure surveys of participants and hosts; and re-categorization of related business sectors. The results of the input-output analysis showed that per capita expenditure for international and domestic participants was US$2,432.4 and US$459.3, respectively, and the per capita average budget was US$562.1. Based on these findings, the total contribution of the international meeting industry to the Korean economy exceeds US$1,343.2 million in output, US$236.6 million in personal income, US$589.3 million in value added, US$61.5 million in tax revenue and 16,336 full-time-equivalent jobs. These results provide two key implications, providing evidence of the importance of both the supply and demand sides and the relative importance of each sub-industry for increasing economic benefit.","[Kim, Dae-Kwan] Kyung Hee Univ, MICE Stat & Informat Ctr, Dept Convent Management, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Kim, Hak-Jun] Kyung Hee Cyber Univ, Dept Sport Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Min] Hannam Univ, Dept Convent & Hotel Management, Coll Econ & Business Adm, Taejon 306791, South Korea; [Choe, Yeongbae] Univ Florida, Dept Tourism Recreat & Sport Management, Natl Lab Tourism & eCommerce, Gainesville, FL USA; [Song, Soo-Yeop] Kyung Hee Univ, MICE Stat & Informat Ctr, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Hannam University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, SM (通讯作者)，Hannam Univ, Dept Convent & Hotel Management, Coll Econ & Business Adm, 70 Hannam Ro, Taejon 306791, South Korea.",kdk@khu.ac.kr; hjkim7@khcu.ac.kr; lsm6516@hnu.ac.kr; ychoe@ufl.edu; greematha@khu.ac.kr,"Choe, Yeongbae/E-1525-2015","Choe, Yeongbae/0000-0003-3225-469X; Kim, Dae-Kwan/0000-0002-1822-6599",,,,,51,4,4,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It concludes that conceptions of Russia as an energy security guarantor have changed since Bulgaria's EU accession and that Bulgarian energy policy has undergone a qualified reorientation away from a positive dependence on Russian energy sources, towards a convergence with EU priorities of diversification and a single energy market.","Kings Coll London, Int Polit, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Maltby, T (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Int Polit, Dept Polit Econ, Strand Bldg, London WC2R 2LS, England.",tomas.maltby@kcl.ac.uk,"Maltby, Tomas/J-6798-2016","Maltby, Tomas/0000-0002-8434-9749",ESRC [ES/H015418/1],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the ESRC, grant number ES/H015418/1.

But is there any vicious circle? And if so, will resolution tools be able to break it? In literature, the circular nature of the relationship between banking and sovereign debt crises has not yet been properly addressed. Indeed, most papers exclusively focus on one channel of transmission, either quantifying the effects that banking crises have on public finances or analyzing when banking crises may cause sovereign debt crises (or vice-versa). In this paper we propose a computational approach to quantify the effects of this circular relationship and to highlight how sovereign and bank riskiness may increase because of their interconnection. We quantify the effects of bank distress on the banking system itself, passing through the higher public deficit induced by State support, and the subsequent haircut in government bonds. We then test the effectiveness of the bail-in tool proposed in the Single Resolution Mechanism context. The method is tested on four European countries. Results show that, while limited crises tend to be absorbed by the system, serious crises tend to exacerbate at each turn, so that it becomes impossible to stop them without external intervention. Moreover, results show that a bail-in of 8 % of total bank balance sheet can be really effective in breaking the vicious circle and preventing contagion between banks and public finances. This finding supports the bail-in as a valid instrument to avoid taxpayers paying the bill of banking crises.","[Zedda, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Galliani, Clara] Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs DG ECFIN, Unit Countries G20 D3, IMF,G Grp, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",University of Cagliari,"Zedda, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Via S Ignazio 74, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",clara.galliani@ec.europa.eu; szedda@unica.it,"Zedda, Stefano/AAH-3121-2020","Zedda, Stefano/0000-0002-3663-8028",,,,,27,16,17,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

While most of the existing literature has focused on the effects on labour demand and productivity, the effects on domestic R&D have largely been neglected. Using Swedish firm-level data, we analyse the effects of material offshoring on the R&D intensity of domestic firms. The results suggest that the overall impact of offshoring on R&D is negative. The negative effect on home country R&D stems from offshoring by small firms from other high-income countries. Conversely, offshoring increases home country R&D among large firms. As large firms perform the bulk of Swedish R&D, the net effect of offshoring on R&D is positive.","[Karpaty, Patrik] Univ Orebro, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson] Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Orebro University,"Karpaty, P (通讯作者)，Univ Orebro, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",,,,Torsten Soderbergs Research Foundation,Torsten Soderbergs Research Foundation,"We thank Ari Kokko, Linda Andersson, Fredrik Sjoholm and seminar participants in Lund, Molle, Stockholm, Orebro and Rome and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

Our goal is to assess whether the hourly bids of market participants, together with information on thermal unit characteristics and power output, suggest that the five suppliers were behaving in line with Nash supply function competition, bidding close to their marginal costs or restraining quantities relative to the Nash level. The analysis of residual demand inverse elasticities suggests that the five thermal generators had an incentive to exercise unilateral market power that was not always fully exploited. A comparison of market-clearing prices, estimated marginal costs and marginal revenues finds that firm conduct was broadly consistent with Nash supply function competition or more competitive than Nash behavior in most of our sample.","[Lo Prete, Chiara] Penn State Univ, Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Environm Energy Sustainabil & Hlth Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Johns Hopkins University,"Lo Prete, C (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, 110 Hosler Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",chiaraloprete@psu.edu,,,National Science Foundation under NSF-EFRI [0835879]; Harvard University Center for the Environment,National Science Foundation under NSF-EFRI; Harvard University Center for the Environment,"Funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation under NSF-EFRI grant 0835879 and the Harvard University Center for the Environment.

Two kinds of behavioural economics - classical and modern - are attributed, respectively, to the two pioneers. The mathematical foundations of classical behavioural economics are identified, largely, to be in the theory of computation and computational complexity; the mathematical basis for modern behavioural economics is claimed to be a notion of subjective probability. Individually rational economic theories of behaviour, with attempts to broaden - and deepen - the notion of rationality, challenging its orthodox variants, were decisively influenced by these two mathematical underpinnings.","[Kao, Ying-Fang] Univ Trento, Sch Social Sci ASSRU, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Velupillai, K.

To better understand this phenomenon we examine the cross-sectional dispersion of REIT returns during this time period with a particular focus on the influence of their capital structures. By looking at both the debt ratio and the maturity structure of the debt, we separate the pure leverage effect from the effect of financial distress. Consistent with leverage and financial distress costs amplifying the price decline, we find that the share prices of REITs with higher debt-to-asset ratios and shorter maturity debt fell more during the 2007 to early-2009 crisis period. Although REIT prices rebounded with the bounce back in commercial real estate prices, financial distress costs had a permanent effect on REIT values. In particular, we find that REITs with more debt due during the crisis period tended to sell more property and issue more equity in 2009, when prices were depressed.","[Sun, Libo] Cal Poly Pomona, Coll Business Adm, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Titman, Sheridan D.; Twite, Garry J.] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Sun, LB (通讯作者)，Cal Poly Pomona, Coll Business Adm, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",lsun@csupomona.edu; titman@mail.utexas.edu; garry.twite@mccombs.utexas.edu,,"Twite, Garry/0000-0001-8730-9411",,,,,16,43,46,1,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2015,43.0,1,,,,,8,36,,10.1111/1540-6229.12055,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CI3IY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354642600002,0

Yet, empirical studies of income inequality are typically based on observations of income for one or a few years. In this paper, we exploit a unique data set with nearly career-long income histories to assess the role of so-called life-cycle bias in empirical analysis of income inequality that uses current income variables as proxies for lifetime income. We find evidence of substantial life-cycle bias in estimates of inequality based on current income. One implication is that cross-sectional estimates of income inequality are likely to be sensitive to the age composition of the sample. A decomposition of the life-cycle bias into income mobility and heterogeneous profiles reveal the importance of two explanations that have been put forth to explain the disagreement between current and lifetime inequality.","[Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, Res Dept, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Aaberge, Rolf] Univ Oslo, ESOP, Oslo, Norway; [Mogstad, Magne] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, Chicago, IL USA",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Chicago,"Aaberge, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Res Dept, Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",rolf.aaberge@ssb.no; magne.mogstad@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,12,13,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,217,230,,10.1007/s00355-014-0838-3,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000001,0

The test statistics and the estimators are computed using mixed integer programming methods. It is found that in the worst-case scenario index, GHG emissions contribute the most (with a weight around 68 %), net forest depletion contributes with around 30 %, and water pollution contributes the least (with a weight around 2 %).

The landowner incurs up-front development costs that are irreversible and thereafter receives stochastic urban rents. A tighter density ceiling control will extend the urban boundary and decrease housing prices.

Existing evidence suggests that increased access to information technology has improved agricultural market efficiency for consumer markets and certain commodities, but there is less evidence of its impact on producer markets. Building on the work of Aker (2010), we estimate the impact of mobile phone coverage on producer price dispersion for three commodities in Niger. Our results suggest that mobile phone coverage reduces spatial producer price dispersion by 6 percent for cowpea, a semi-perishable commodity. These effects are strongest for remote markets and during certain periods of the year. The introduction of mobile phone coverage has no effect on producer price dispersion for millet and sorghum, two staple grains that are less perishable and are commonly stored by farmers. There are no impacts of mobile phone coverage on producer price levels, but mobile phone coverage is associated with a reduction in the intra-annual price variation for cowpea.

Trunk shakers are commonly used in mechanical harvesting to detach olives. Field trials showed that with this equipment less than 100% of the production is detached, usually 70% to 90% (Michelakis, 2002). It is important to increase the percentage of fruits harvested, to reduce losses. To achieve this goal factors affecting mechanical olive harvesting must be known, to be used in the definition of harvest season. Some of these factors are the result of the orchard management, like tree shape, canopy density, pruning methods. Others depend on the cultivar, such as fruit removal force (FRF), fruit weight (P) and the ratio between them. FRF and P are considered decisive in the detachment process. Results of field trials carried out in the Northeast of Portugal with Cobrancosa Transmontana cultivar show the FRF, P and their ratio evolution in the ripening period. They have potential to become indicators of the mechanical olive harvest season.

Anti-import lobbying, combined with media attention, has raised consumers awareness on the safety issues associated with imported vegetables. This study investigates consumers' food safety concerns and possible responses to such concerns. A total of 1,370 questionnaires were administered through 17 organisations in South East Queensland in 2013 to achieve a response rate of 63%. Ordered logit regression analysis was performed to examine the factors influencing consumers' attitudes towards their willingness-to-pay for Australian vegetables. Results revealed that 37% of respondents considered vegetables as 'very safe' and 25% considered food inspection schemes in Australia to be 'very reliable'. Consumers' beliefs on the impact of unsafe food, safety concerns and prior knowledge of food safety incidents influenced their attitudes and hence most were willing to pay more for domestically produced fresh/processed vegetables. Time spent living in Australia and gender also influenced the willingness-to-pay. This study shows that vegetable consumers do respond to food safety concerns and there is an opportunity for the vegetable industry to respond to these concerns.","[Ariyawardana, A.; Ganegodage, K.

At examples it is shown that the period of transition from an unlimited growth of the market agents to the stage of competitive growth takes quite a long time and may be characterized as monotonic. During this period two main strategies of competitive selection coexist: 1) capture of maximum market space with any reasonable costs; 2) saving by reducing costs. The obtained results allow concluding that the competitive strategies of companies must combine two mentioned types of behavior, and this issue needs to be given adequate attention in the academic literature on management. The created numerical model may be used for market research when developing of the strategies for promotion of new goods and services.","[Berg, D. B.; Beklemishev, K. A.; Medvedev, A.

We show that this policy contributed to a shift in demand away from free schools, where net enrollment stagnated after 2003, toward fee-charging private schools, where both enrollment and fee levels grew rapidly after 2003. These shifts had mixed distributional consequences. Enrollment by poorer households increased, but segregation between socio-economic groups also increased. We find evidence that the shift in demand toward private schooling was driven by more affluent households who (i) paid higher ex ante fees and thus experienced a larger reduction in school funding, and (ii) exited public schools in reaction to increased enrollment by poorer children.

The importance of the urban and public spaces in the communication of identity might be seen as one aspect of the broad area of research into the meaning of the urban space and its relationship to the physical form in Algiers. Typically, the urban and public spaces symbolize accepted notions of the appropriate function of the plaza and preferred public relations, such notions are in themselves profoundly important in structuring gender relations. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on two methodologies: Deductive: a theoretical investigation based on the properties of the city structure, definitions, principles of design, and the dilemma of achieving modernization is as much cultural as technical. This combines information from literature reviews and the ideas of key figures in the urban development field and the place-identity, social identity and identity process as theories for cultural models of the city. Inductive: a study of Algiers as example of historical settlements that have undergone much change processes. The study looks to elicit the images of the city main structure to support the theoretical propositions of surface and deep structural city elements. The conclusion to this part is based on an analysis of the case study. Originality/value - The city of today differs from its past in several respects: size and scale, street layout, land use patterns, architectural style and type of housing. Traditional urban form and building which would have provided information about regional and national identity have been largely replaced by forms characterizing the international and universal buildings and spaces. These changes have altered the city's form and have given rise to questions about the impact of these changes on the image of the city in terms of size and cultural values. So the concept of urban space becomes a determinant of the ability of planners, architects, engineers and administrators to provide an environment which is adequately structured to avoid chaos and to maintain an acceptable quality of life. Practical implications - How people experience places, what constitutes a place and how identity is formed.","Ajman Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architectural Engn, Ajman, U Arab Emirates",Ajman University,"Boudiaf, B (通讯作者)，Ajman Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architectural Engn, POB 346, Ajman, U Arab Emirates.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2155,2178,,,,,,24,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200170,0

In this new perspective, organizational culture is one of the nonlinear integrators that contributes directly to the transformation of the potential innovation capital into the operational innovation capital. Design/methodology/approach - My approach is based on a metaphorical interpretation of knowledge and intellectual capital as being organizational fields, and by considering the hypothesis of thermodynamic transformation of the potential of innovation capital into the operational innovation capital, which is generating through the innovation process a competitive advantage. That means a conceptual analysis supported by a literature search and adopting an entropic perspective. The great majority of knowledge and intellectual capital interpretations are based on metaphors that use a Newtonian perspective. Based on the new thermodynamic paradigm I propose a new interpretation of knowledge and intellectual capital as fields, which constitutes a better representation of their intangible nature. Also, by using the theory of nonlinear integrators, I can evidence the role of organizational culture in promoting innovation. Organizational culture is not a simple key success factor but a nonlinear integrator able to influence both the inputs and outputs of the innovation process. Originality/value - The proposed entropic model of innovation is based on the previous research of metaphorical analysis of knowledge and intellectual capital, and it is integrated into a more general perspective of thermodynamic transformations of the potential of innovation capital into the operational innovation capital through the work of nonlinear integrators. Cultural values play an important role in creating a shared vision and a successful corporate strategic thinking. Practical implications - The proposed entropic model of innovation contributes to a better understanding of the innovation process within the organizational intellectual capital, and allows new interpretations for the entropic transformations of rational, emotional, and spiritual knowledge and intellectual capital from one form into another. Also, managers can understand better the role played by organizational culture as a nonlinear integrator in stimulating innovation.","Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept UNESCO Business Adm, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest 010731, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept UNESCO Business Adm, Fac Business Adm, Calea Grivitei 2,Sect 1, Bucharest 010731, Romania.",,"CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018","CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384",,,,,53,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1705,1715,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200130,0

The study employs the previous studies and engages an interview session with the staff of Ar Rahnu Bank Rakyat. In the early stage of Ar-Rahnu establishment, the demand was influenced by the Muslim societies to obtain financing based on the Shariah principle. Simultaneously, with the effort of the Malaysian government to promote the development of Islamic pawn broking industry, the demand for Ar-Rahnu services increase continuously. The industry has tremendously contributed to the Muslim economy because it plays an important role as a means of community service that fulfil the desperate needs of low income families. It also acts as a source of capital to small businesses that provides quick and easy source of financing as compared to loans from commercial banks. More importantly, this paper also attempts to highlight on the existing challenges of Ar Rahnu, with respect to its growth and development.","[bt Bahari, Nor Fadilah; dt Fisal, Shafina; dt Shahar, Wan Shahdila Shah] Selangor Int Islamic Univ Coll, Dept Banking & Finance, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [bin Shahadan, Hj Tajul Azli] Sultan Azlan Shah Islamic Univ Coll KUISAS, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Kuala Kangsar 33000, Perak, Malaysia",,"bt Bahari, NF (通讯作者)，Selangor Int Islamic Univ Coll, Dept Banking & Finance, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",norfadilah@kuis.edu.my; shafina@kuis.edu.my; wanshahdila@kuis.edu.my; tajulazli@kuisas.edu.my,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,230,238,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900034,0

An overall evaluation of the living mulch system is performed taking into account environmental and economic aspects in the frame of a decision making process aimed to assess a trade-off between positive and negative effects. This paper reports on the preliminary results obtained during the first year in four field experiments carried out in a range of European environments growing living mulched cauliflower. Yield, yield quality parameters, crop/weeds interaction, risk of nitrate leaching, harmful and beneficial arthropod populations, and energy consumption in living mulch and sole cropped systems were compared to verify the hypothesis that the introduction and the proper management of living mulch provides economically and environmentally outstanding agro-ecosystems. The results indicated that the growing of a well-managed living mulch, i.e. by late sowing relative to cauliflower transplanting and/or root cutting of permanent mulches, did not reduce cauliflower yield and yield quality and created an unfavourable environment for weeds, avoiding crop suppression. Smaller positive effects were observed as far as mitigation of the risk of nitrate leaching and reduction in energy consumption.","[Canali, S.; Campanelli, G.; Ciaccia, C.; Tittarelli, F.] Consiglio Ric Sperimentaz Agr, Rome, Italy; [Bavec, F.] Univ Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia; [von Fragstein, P.] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany; [Burgio, G.] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Ortolani, L.] Italian Assoc Organ Agr, Turin, Italy; [Kristensen, H.

We adopt as a benchmark a common specification in the literature, a BVAR with variables entering in levels and a prior modeled along the lines of Sims and Zha (International Economic Review 1998; 39: 949-968). We then consider optimal choice of the tightness, of the lag length and of both; evaluate the relative merits of modeling in levels or growth rates; compare alternative approaches to h-step-ahead forecasting (direct, iterated and pseudo-iterated); discuss the treatment of the error variance and of cross-variable shrinkage; and assess rolling versus recursive estimation. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the results to the VAR size and composition (using also data for France, Canada and the UK, while the main analysis is for the USA). We obtain a large set of empirical results, but the overall message is that we find very small losses (and sometimes even gains) from the adoption of specification choices that make BVAR modeling quick and easy, in particular for point forecasting. This finding could therefore further enhance the diffusion of the BVAR as an econometric tool for a vast range of applications.

Due to the major importance of sustainability issues within all Tourism Policies adopted by the European Commission, great importance has been given to the creation of benchmarking tools for sustainable destinations. The paper advances the idea of developing a friendly ICT instrument to support the implementation of such European benchmarking tools in order to actively contribute to the sustainable development of more and more tourist destinations in Europe. Two qualitative research methods were used within the present paper: the literature review and innovation. The first part of the article synthesizes the information on tourist destination benchmarking, based on tourism literature review. A short presentation regarding the initiatives of the European Commission for the benchmarking of tourist destinations was included. The paper than focuses on the most recent benchmarking tool launched by the European Commission in 2010, the European Tourist Indicators System for Sustainable Destinations. Through comparison between this tool and the Dashboard of Sustainability, we advanced the idea of the necessity to develop the European Tourist Indicators System for Sustainable Destinations into an ICT instrument offering attractive visual representations for better implementation within European destinations.","[Cismaru, Laura] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Food & Tourism, Brasov, Romania; [Bratucu, Gabriel] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Cismaru, L (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Food & Tourism, Brasov, Romania.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,259,266,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400033,0

At the border of Ghana and at the end of the 1980s, large discontinuities are detected for consumption, child stunting, and access to electricity and safe water. Border discontinuities in consumption can be explained by differences in cash crop policies (cocoa and coffee). When these policies converged in the 1990s, the only differences that persisted were those in rural facilities. In the North, cash crop (cotton) income again made a difference for consumption and nutrition (the case of Mali). On the one hand, large differences in welfare can hold at the borders dividing African countries despite their assumed porosity. On the other hand, border discontinuities seem to reflect the impact of reversible public policies rather than intangible institutional traits.","[Cogneau, Denis] Paris Sch Econ, IRD, Paris, France; [Mesple-Somps, Sandrine] Univ Paris 09, IRD, UMR DIAL 225, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Spielvogel, Gilles] Univ Paris 01, IRD, UMR Dev & Soc 201, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Spielvogel, Gilles] DIAL, Paris, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Paris School of Economics; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Cogneau, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, IRD, Paris, France.",denis.cogneau@psemail.eu; mesple@dial.prd.fr; gilles.spielvogel@univ-paris1.fr,"Cogneau, Denis/JCO-4775-2023",,,,,,45,3,4,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Our analysis is part of the Italian research project OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A (ORganization of Cultural HEritage for Smart Tourism and Real-time Accessibility) meant to develop a crowdsourcing community in the city of Naples (Italy). Successful crowdsourcing solutions require activities that both fulfill the communities administrators' needs and - by utilizing various motivation mechanisms - account for individual contributors' needs. Thus, understanding and analyzing the incentives that spur users to contribute are critical to designing crowdsourcing applications (Cuel and Zamarian, 2014). In this study we set up a field experiment, in order to understand which types of incentives are useful to engage users to produce contents for OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A and better address a specific behavior. Methodology - In order to understand the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation with respect to individual behaviours, we administrate a questionnaire to university students related to their education and cultural background and consumptions, and social status, their internet usages, and we follow their behaviour on the OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A community. We explore through multivariate methods the characteristics of our users looking for clusters. Furthermore through our hypothesis we test the impact of the two different motivations taking into account some of the relevant individual behaviours. Originality/value - Our contribution is to provide reflections on extrinsic and intrinsic incentive mechanisms, in order to explore the extent to which incentives are able to engage and to motivate users in community building processes. Second, through the field experiment we shed light on a partly jagged topic and we provide some normative suggestions on how to design a crowdsourcing application. In particular, we try to explain results and emerging issue needed to create a model of incentive mechanisms that could be used in the OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A web platform. Practical implications - OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A falls within the field Smart Culture and Tourism and is part of several valorisation projects of the city of Naples. The community aims to be a benchmark of the production of UGC, the engage of the crowd and the users interaction. Many touristic and cultural communities began huge business all over the world thanks to user-generated contents. In fact over the years it has become clear that users handle the review tool for the destinations they visit or for commercial products and services, and for supporting or criticizing the hospitality of some structures.","[Consiglio, Stefano; Cicellin, Mariavittoria; Scuotto, Adriana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Management, Inst,CU Monte SantAngelo, Naples, Italy; [Ragozini, Giancarlo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Scuotto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Management, Inst,CU Monte SantAngelo, Via Cinthia, Naples, Italy.",,"Ragozini, Giancarlo/AAE-2923-2021; Ragozini, Giancarlo/JDW-0130-2023; Scuotto, Adriana/HOF-1391-2023","Ragozini, Giancarlo/0000-0002-2385-4645; Ragozini, Giancarlo/0000-0002-2385-4645; Scuotto, Adriana/0000-0002-1110-0539",,,,,48,0,0,1,30,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1404,1418,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200108,0

'Alborea' was obtained from an open pollinated 'Fortune' mandarin. Fruits reach optimum maturity at the beginning of January, although they can be harvested from December until the end of January. Fruits are easy-to-peel, with a diameter of 50-60 mm, and rind is deep orange red in color. 'Albir' was obtained from a cross between 'Fortune' and 'Kara' mandarins. Fruits reach optimum maturity at the beginning of February, although they can be harvested from January until second half of February. Fruits are easy-to-peel with a diameter of 60-70 mm and fruit rind is orange red in color. This variety has the same origin as 'Safor', a previously released triploid hybrid. The fruits of the two varieties are somewhat similar, but 'Albir' matures one month earlier. With these cultivars, 'Albir' and 'Safor', it will be possible to supply similar fruits to the market from January to the end of March.","[Cuenca, Jose; Aleza, Pablo; Juarez, Jose; Pina, Jose A.; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lnavarro@ivia.es,"Aleza, Pablo/M-3710-2014; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Aleza, Pablo/ABF-4339-2020; Cuenca, Jose/N-7047-2014","Aleza, Pablo/0000-0002-8936-1448; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0003-3554-5337; CUENCA, JOSE/0000-0002-3094-9933",,,,,17,3,4,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,209,214,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600022,0

This study examines the role of internal and external pressures in encouraging corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting among financial institutions in Malaysia. The sample for the study comprised of 20 financial institutions in Malaysia over a four-year period from 2008 - 2011. Content analyses of annual and sustainability reports were undertaken to measure the quality of ethical and social responsibility reporting among the financial institutions. An un-weighted CSR quality disclosure index was developed to measure the quality of information reported. The findings of the study revealed that the quality of CSR information disclosed improved over the four-year period. This is a positive development suggesting that the financial institutions are becoming more socially responsible. The results of the study also revealed that it is the external pressure in the form of concentrated ownership and customers' pressure that can either inhibit or motivate the quality of CSR reporting while the internal pressure prove not to be a significant driver in promoting the quality of CSR reporting.

Since it is takes place almost throughout the whole year, diving tourism can affect overcoming the strong seasonality of the Croatian tourism. Researches indicate that due to the climatic conditions, diving tourism in Croatia is becoming more and more popular. Global trends indicate that this type of tourism is a rapidly growing industry that generates significant revenues and that is why states at the seaside try to make the most of its potential, creating additional preconditions for this. In Croatia, thoughts about such possibilities are in the initial stage, despite significant natural and human resources.

It analyzes Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns in the innovation process under the four different perspectives proposed in the theoretical framework of the CKI model (Palmieri and Giglio, 2013; Palmieri and Giglio, 2014). It aims to identify determining factors and impacts of the technology platform at urban, regional or national level. This application of the CKI model is geared to prove how its comprehensive slant supports the design, monitoring and assessment of innovation plans. Design/methodology/approach - This work is based on a case study approach and on a qualitative research involving literature review activities. Its design is compliant with the theoretical framework of the CKI model in order to identify the aforementioned four perspectives and capture the outcomes of the innovation process for all possible stakeholders. It utilizes a mixed methodology consisting of a panel of experts, geared to perform a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of impacts of the entrepreneurial initiative, and the participation observation methodology, for a complementary analysis of interaction patterns throughout the process. Originality/value - The study proposes a very recent theoretical framework to analyze entrepreneurial initiatives with a broader perspective than the prevailing one in literature. Applying the CKI model to the case study at hand proves how deep can be the impacts of a start-up initiative and helps deepening the impacts of Creativity vs Knowledge interaction patterns at the initial stage of the innovation process. Moreover, it provides a hitherto unexplored methodological approach consisting of a complementary analysis of interaction patterns in innovation processes by mixing the participation observation and the panel of experts methodologies. Practical implications - The end result of this study shows the real-world impacts of such a research project focusing on the value creation for different stakeholders and the community as a whole. It deepens also how Creativity vs Knowledge dynamics play as determinants and affect the end result of the innovation process. This work includes also a methodology tool for scholars since it is endowed with two complementary approaches - i.e. participation observation and panel of experts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with the first guide about the application of the CKI in order to conduct similar studies in other contexts.","Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Giglio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, Cubo 42-C-8 Piano, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",,"Giglio, Carlo/C-5853-2016","Giglio, Carlo/0000-0001-7244-1049",,,,,42,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,306,322,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200024,0

Unemployment rate constitutes an excellent example in this matter. Its basic variant is defined as the quotient of unemployed people number and the working population (unemployed and employed), however, sometimes it is indicated that this relationship is based on the number of unemployed people and the production age population. Solving this alternative does not seem difficult. Adopting conventional definitions of unemployment rate components is much more complicated, i.e. the definition of an unemployed and an employed person. Different interpretations of meanings ingrained in these concepts result in an indicator value variation which, by assumption, is supposed to describe accurately the intensity of unemployment phenomenon in a given population. This problem is well visible based on the example of Polish regions (unemployment rate measurement within the framework of Labour Force Survey and national employment offices). Therefore, it seems founded to pose a question - what should be done to make national and/or international unemployment statistics more credible?

Search and matching theory offers a potential explanation: if education systems are such that graduates find it difficult to signal competence and achievement through grades and the quality of their institution, then employers might have difficult matching with suitable candidates, resulting in high unemployment. We developed and tested a labor market screening and matching service in Amman, Jordan, which aimed to generate higher employment for educated youth by reducing these matching frictions. This paper examines the first step in this process, which involved testing unemployed, tertiary-educated, youth on mental ability, English proficiency, soft skills, Excel ability, and also measuring their big five personality traits. We show that these measures have predictive power for subsequent employment and for earnings conditional on employment, even after conditioning on major, university, and other controls. Psychometric testing therefore offers the potential to reduce information asymmetries that result in labor market matching frictions.","[Groh, Matthew; McKenzie, David; Vishwanath, Tara] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Groh, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Groh, Matthew/KCK-4483-2024; Jani, Arpit/B-5376-2017","Groh, Matthew/0000-0002-9029-0157;",TFESSD trust fund; Knowledge for Change (KCP) trust fund; Research Support Budget (RSB) of the World Bank,TFESSD trust fund; Knowledge for Change (KCP) trust fund; Research Support Budget (RSB) of the World Bank,"We thank the TFESSD trust fund, the Knowledge for Change (KCP) trust fund, and the Research Support Budget (RSB) of the World Bank for their generous support of this project; Dr Marwan Al-Zoubi for his collaboration on developing the psychometric measures used here; the Business Development Center (BDC) and Dajani Consulting for their work in project implementation; and Nandini Krishnan and Nour Shammout for their collaboration on related aspects of this project.

If slack resources are available from previous financial performance, better financial performance would be a predictor for better social performance. However, past studies have documented inconsistent evidence of the relationship between with financial performance (FP) and social performance (SP). To improve the theoretical framework, this study introduces moderator variables, director ownership that expected to enhance the relationship between financial and social performance. This argument is on their ability of influencing company decision making since they are the owner of company. They have voting right to make decision this will help to the increase of slack resources allocation in social activity. Past study documented positive relationship between director ownership and social performance this provide evidence that when director of company have positive view toward SP this will help to increase to allocation available slack resources in social activity that will lead better SP. Sample of this study comprises of 262 public listed companies in Bursa Malaysia for the year 2012. The results of the regression analysis provide a support for slack resource theory, that is, financially strong companies have a positive and significant relationship with social performance. Furthermore this study is expected to supports the board ownership in influencing the relationship. This study contributes new knowledge by introducing director ownership as moderator of the relationship between social performance and financial performance.","[Ismail, Sarifah; Tajuddin, Teh Suhaila; Aman, Zainab] Kolej Univ Islam Antarabangsa Selangor KUIS, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia",,"Ismail, S (通讯作者)，Kolej Univ Islam Antarabangsa Selangor KUIS, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",sarifah@kuis.edu.my; tehsuhaila@kuis.edu.my; zainab@kuis.edu.my,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,221,229,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900033,0

The very setup was closely surveyed by researchers of knowledge architecture TU Dresden regarding two central parameters of collaborative group work: 1) creative production, as the goal of the summer school was the creation of new concepts on future urbanism; 2) spatial arrangement, as the space in case was a large open office, allowing for multiple re-arrangements of spatial elements (e.g. furniture, work groups, technical equipment) and types of use (presentation mode, concentration modes). Creative Production: The 2-week workshop design comprised various individual and group activities in different spatial settings (single cabinets, work group arrangement, or presentation and panel settings), and has led to the production of 50 co-created ideas by the 20 summer school participants. These ideas were eventually developed into three different formats: project sketches (3), paper sketches (4), and proposal sketches (4). The summer school setting stated to be a starting point for long-lasting collaboration ships. Socio-spatial arrangement (Workshop Design) The 2-week event was video-recorded, thus allowing for time-lapse analysis of layout changes and utilization. Different, bevor developed, methods were now used to enhance co-creation under certain conditions. 1) constant conditions: time (2-weeks) and group constellation (20 members), and 2) adjustable condition: spatial work environment. From the analysis, parameters of spatial arrangement and group activity could be directly inferred, which in turn indicated soft social parameters like group spirit, trust and engagement. With the combination of data on the creative output on the one hand, and the data about socio-spatial arrangement on the other, the impact of purposefully designed work program and work environment on co-creation can be systematically tested and validated. A co-creation methodology is derived from this data-set.","[Jannack, Anja; Noennig, Joerg Rainer] TU Dresden Dresden Univ Technol, Knowledge Architecture Lab, Dept Architecture, Dresden, Germany",,"Jannack, A (通讯作者)，TU Dresden Dresden Univ Technol, Knowledge Architecture Lab, Dept Architecture, Dresden, Germany.",,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2381,2400,,,,,,20,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200187,0

The cost of excessively high levels of urban concentration can be very high in terms of overpopulation, congestion, and productivity growth. One strand of the theoretical literature suggests that such high levels of concentration may be the result of restrictive trade policies that trigger forces of agglomeration. Another strand of the literature, however, points out that trade liberalization itself may exacerbate urban concentration by favoring the further growth of those large urban centers that have better access to international markets. The empirical basis for judging this question has been weak so far; in the existing literature, trade policies are poorly measured (or are not measured, as when trade volumes are used spuriously). Here, we use new disaggregated tariff measures to empirically test the hypothesis. We also employ a treatment-and-control analysis of pre-versus post-liberalization performance of the cities in liberalizing and non-liberalizing countries. We find evidence that (controlling for the largest cities that have ports and, thus, have better access to external markets) liberalizing trade leads to a reduction in urban concentration.

Based on in-depth interviews with managers of five companies we found out that marketing managers in SMEs tend to use hard indicators of company performance, whereas they ignore soft ones. Furthermore, the reward system used by SMEs supports their short-term orientation. Moreover, this study also points out that SMEs do not systematically monitor the activities of competition on the market and do not connect this information into neither short-term nor long-term company strategy. Last but not least, we found differences in objective setting between companies with and without a foreign mother company. Whereas companies with foreign mother company prepare their strategy and expected results in advance, companies without foreign mother company assess performance according to the last period. All of these findings denote that the level of market orientation of Czech companies is far from optimal, and that the performance measurement and reward systems do not support market orientation.","[Marik, Jiri; Novinsky, Marek; Karlicek, Miroslav] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Marík, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jiri.marik@vse.cz; marek.novinsky@vse.cz; miroslav.karlicek@vse.cz,"Karlicek, Miroslav/AAK-2659-2020",,,,,,11,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1097,1106,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000104,0

To this end, we researched the differential expression of proteins related to these processes between on-crop and off-crop 'Moncada' mandarin leaves. Samples were collected in November and proteins were extracted. From 2D DIGE gel of these extracts, 33 spots related to primary metabolism were isolated: 26 spots being associated with photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, 4 spots related to Krebs cycle, 1 spot related to pentose phosphate pathway, and 2 spots related to nutrient reservoir activity. These spots were identified by MALDI-MS or LC-MS-MS. Between the proteins related to photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, 16 were up-expressed in off-crop leaves, such as NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, RuBisCO large subunit, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, and carbonic anhydrase; while 10 proteins were up-expressed in on-crop leaves such as NADP-dependent malic enzyme, and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone kinase. The isolated proteins related to pentose phosphate pathway (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) and to nutrient reservoir activity (Granule-bound starch synthase Ib precursor) were up-expressed in off-crop leaves. Regarding the proteins related to Krebs cycle, only malate dehydrogenase was up-expressed in off-crop leaves, while the other proteins were up-expressed in on-crop leaves (citrate synthase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase). According to these results, the primary metabolism seems to be more active in off-crop leaves, suggesting that fruit load inhibits the primary metabolism in 'Moncada' mandarins.","[Munoz-Fambuena, Natalia; Mesejo, Carlos; Agusti, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo IAM, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Tarraga, Susana] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas IBMCP, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Iglesias, Domingo J.; Primo-Millo, Eduardo; Carmen Gonzalez-Mas, M.] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular de Plantas (IBMCP); Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"González-Mas, MC (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia, Spain.",gonzalez_mde@gva.es,"Iglesias, Domingo J./C-9000-2014; Primo-Millo, Eduardo/D-8584-2014; González-Mas, Maria Carmen/E-6230-2014; González-Mas, M.

This paper builds a multi-sector endogenous growth model to study the influence of trade liberalisation on innovation and, by extension, on sector and aggregate productivity growth under sectoral heterogeneity. I find that differences in the degree of competition generate substantial differences in firms' innovative responses to trade liberalisation. A movement from autarky to free trade promotes innovation and productivity growth in those sectors which are initially less competitive. This result is robust to an alternative scenario in which the economy is open to trade, but the degree of trade openness is common across sectors. Finally the paper outlines the importance of reallocation effects within sectors and across sectors that are the result of differences in product market competition across sectors. A movement towards zero trade costs has a smaller effect on aggregate innovation when the sectors are heterogeneous in terms of competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, an empirical analysis is made for the ecological civilization construction situations and coordination degree in 14 divisions of Xinjiang Corps in 2013. The evaluation results present the following conclusions. (1) Ecological civilization construction presents regional difference in Xinjiang Corps and ecological civilization construction is a progressive course from north Xinjiang to south Xinjiang. The coordination degree of ecological civilization construction in north Xinjiang is higher than that in south Xinjiang, which almost reflects the regional situations of ecological civilization construction in Xinjiang Corps. According to various subsystems, the ecological system pressure in south Xinjiang is smaller than that in north Xinjiang, the health status of ecological system in north Xinjiang is better than that in south Xinjiang, and the management level of ecological environment in north Xinjiang is higher than that in south Xinjiang. (2) North Xinjiang is the population and economic center of Xinjiang Corps and it bears the main area of social & economic construction and resident gathering. Therefore, a great effort should be made to realize a healthy ecological system and enhance resource and energy utilization efficiency in north Xinjiang. At the same time, the ecological environment must be protected and ecological civilization system construction should be strengthened. South Xinjiang should aim to protect the vulnerable ecological environment, preserve its original ecological environment, and improve its resource and energy utilization efficiency and environmental pollution control ability.","[Pan Shasha] Tarim Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Alar City of Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang Chuanhui] Tarim Univ, Dept Ideol & Polit Educ, Alar City of Xinjiang, Peoples R China",Tarim University; Tarim University,"Pan, SS (通讯作者)，Tarim Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Alar City of Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",chuanhui@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-97-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2015,29.0,,,,,,123,128,,,,,,6,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BD9JW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364788100028,0

Tests during freezes between 1980 and 2010 showed that microsprinklers were effective in protecting the lower 0.9 m of young citrus trees, thereby saving the bud union and allowing later regrowth. Microsprinklers also benefit mature trees. The amount of air temperature warming depends on several factors, including volume of water applied, dew point temperature, and wind speed. Microsprinkler irrigation is more effective for cold protection when higher volumes of water are applied. Irrigation rates of 18.7 m(3) ha(-1) h(-1) have been recommended. At these rates, average air temperature warming at a 1.2 m height is 0.6 to 1.4 degrees C. At tree heights of more than 2.4 m, warming is commonly less than 0.5 degrees C. In windy, low humidity freezes, evaporative cooling can damage trees, particularly if the emitter is on the downwind side of the tree. Protection is better if the microsprinkler is placed on the upwind (north or northwest in Florida) side of the tree. Microsprinklers elevated to a height of 0.6 to 0.9 m protect more of the tree than those at 0.2 m. While it was initially thought that microsprinklers provided no frost protection to the fruit, recent research has shown that this irrigation can promote better production of juice and kg of soluble solids than when no irrigation is used. Microsprinkler irrigation has become the most commonly used form of frost protection in Florida citrus.","Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Parsons, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",lparsons@ufl.edu,,,,,,,19,2,2,1,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1437,1442,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.182,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600182,0

However, the attention paid to the issues of slavery and the slave trade in Spanish economic literature was decreasing: from having a place in scholastic texts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to becoming something completely marginal for the economists of the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century The aim of this article is to highlight this paradox by analyzing the few texts of scholastic theologians, arbitristas and economists of the Enlightenment that addressed slavery and the slave trade. The question is interesting, since in these three centuries the Spanish economic debates reached a good level, as reflected in the translations into other European languages of numerous Spanish economic works.

Erratic bacterial accumulation was observed in both sweet orange and Tahiti lime. After detection in one quadrant of the plant, the continued presence of the bacterium in the same quadrant was not verifiable a few months later. In sweet orange trees, the quadrants expressing more severe symptoms had higher bacterial titer, with Ct values between 18 and 33. Similar results were found for Tahiti lime.

The economic revenues generated by these forms of academic entrepreneurship are becoming more and more attractive for higher education institutions in order to develop new revenue value streams and sustain financial viability (Shane 2004b; Wright et al. 2007; Wong 2011). In addition, it is pointed out that academic entrepreneurship plays an important role toward the creation of societal value (Botes 2005). This paper aims to prospect academic entrepreneurship as a way to connect academia with external stakeholders in order to jointly create value (Kingma 2011). The stakeholders' value network centred on academic entrepreneurship can respond to different wants and needs, not necessarily aligned, and focusing on various forms of value to be created. The holistic integration of such value network is a key issue. This paper draws insights from the investigation of how SENSEable City Lab - an academic lab nested within the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA) - uses design as a translational mechanism to connect and align different stakeholders in the process of value creation in academic entrepreneurship. Design materials such as sketches, data visualization and interactive prototypes are used at various stages to coordinate the stakeholders: through the design process, ideas and concepts undergo semiotic translations and are materialized into visual, audio, tangible formats. Design can even be employed to facilitate participatory design session where all the stakeholders directly contribute to the design process, jointly creating visual representations and prototypes (Simonsen and Robertson 2013). Design/methodology/approach - The study is the result of an investigation - also based on ethnographic methods - conducted over a period of 4 years (2011-2014) at SENSEable City Lab of MIT (USA). This research methodology to investigate a real case study has proven to be an appropriate method to investigate particularly complex phenomena that require a direct involvement of researchers in the field (Czarniawska 2012). Originality/value - This paper analyses the role of design-as-translation and enabling factor in academic entrepreneurship. This is a perspective currently under-investigated in design research. Practical implications - Design can play a relevant role in supporting entrepreneurial activities in academia. These entrepreneurial activities are nowadays particularly important, especially at a time when in most countries public funding for academic institutions is decreasing.","[Simeone, Luca] Malmo Univ, S-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Simeone, Luca; Secundo, Giustina] Univ Arts London, Innovat Insights Hub, London, England; [Secundo, Giustina] Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Lecce, Italy; [Schiuma, Giovanni] Univ Basilicata, DiMIE, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Schiuma, Giovanni] Univ Arts Innovat Insights Hub, London, England",Malmo University; University of Arts London; University of Salento; University of Basilicata,"Simeone, L (通讯作者)，Malmo Univ, O Varvsg 11 A, S-20506 Malmo, Sweden.",,"Schiuma, Giovanni/AAO-9916-2020","Schiuma, Giovanni/0000-0003-4990-9330",,,,,44,0,0,0,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,93,105,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200007,0

Life-long learning became crucial to the future of our society. In order to foster more effective and collaborative learning and knowledge exchange it is necessary to utilize modern information technologies and services. If used in the right way, information technology can transform and energize educational process, stimulate learning in anyplace and anytime, promote creative thinking, and make better use of existing individual and organizational resources. The rationale of this paper is to introduce the innovative open educational model and supporting software system which is capable to answer the major challenges of modern education. Design/ methodology/approach - Although modern web technologies and open educational resources (OER) have great potential to bring new opportunities for learning and knowledge exchange, at the same time, developing successful OER systems is very challenging. Design of an innovative and open learning software environments needs a holistic approach, which comprises specific methodology, software architecture, and various services, applications and tools. This paper describes methodological approach, software architecture, services and features of the innovative software solution, which address important issues that face organizations when designing and implementing OER systems. The modular design and composite architecture enable flexibility in terms of the infrastructure and platform, available services, scalability, and integration. Originality/value - Traditional educational systems cannot completely meet current educational requirements. On the other hand, many of the existing OER and e-learning initiatives didn't fulfil high expectations. The OER model proposed in this paper provides a novel approach to design and utilization of different cutting-edge technologies that are seamlessly combined to provide flexibility, scalability, personalization, collaboration, content management, searching, and social networking. The proposed OER model and software platform enables creation of agile and adaptable educational ecosystem that can transform the learning experience, and connect individuals, educational institutions and companies. Practical implications - The presented OER software architecture is multi-layered and seamlessly combines various services and technologies that enable creation of integrated and feature-rich open educational environments. It is a flexible, customizable, and extensible software environment that can support various OER scenarios. The new application model and software solution are architected and designed in such a way to provide the following advancements in terms of: alignment, agility, adaptivity, manageability, functionality, interoperability, performance, and security. This enables establishing flexible, adaptable, cost-effective and sustainable OER environment where individuals, educational institutions, companies and government collaborate, create, share and discover learning resources and knowledge.","[Stefanovic, Nenad; Milosevic, Danijela] Univ Kragujevac, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Tech Sci, Cacak 32000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Stefanovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Tech Sci, Svetog Save 65, Cacak 32000, Serbia.",,"Stefanovic, Nenad/Q-9913-2019","Stefanovic, Nenad/0000-0002-0339-3474",,,,,14,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1789,1800,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200138,0

Accomplishing these growth or survival strategies often involves collaborative purchasing and marketing with supply chain partners. The horticultural industry, among others, is abuzz with sustainability, emphasizing it as the original green industry. Sustainability encompasses three components: societal or community wellbeing, economics and profitability, and environmental quality. Hence, adopting a strategic alliance among industry partners should enhance the horticulture supply chain sustainability and profitability; but does it? The formation of horticultural crops producer strategic alliances, evaluating the supply chain participation within each of the alliances, and conducting a life cycle assessment to determine the carbon neutrality and sustainability of the supply chain was the impetus of this study. Net results of five transportation alliances established among small-to mid-sized greenhouse (floriculture) and container nurseries (annuals and perennials) in Georgia indicated a 12% average annual total cost savings to participating firms in each alliance, a 23% average annual total miles driven reduction and savings, an 18% average annual vehicle ownership expense savings to the alliance partners, a 31% average annual savings in driver labor and hours of drive time, and a 19% overall (system-wide) reduction in total carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions-reducing the carbon footprint, but not reaching carbon neutrality.","[Stegelin, F.

Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of eight medicinal plants were evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity against G. candidum. Cistus villosus, Ceratonia siliqua and Halimium umbellatum methanol extracts proved to be the most effective, totally inhibiting arthrospore germination of G. candidum at concentrations below 2.5 mg/ml. The methanol extracts of H. umbellatum, C. villosus and C. siliqua exhibited strong antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging between 0.156 and 1.25 mg/ml, and minimum fungicidal concentration values ranging from 2.5 to 5 mg/ml. Incidence of sour rot was reduced to 0.00, 3.33 and 11.66% when mandarin fruits were treated with 50 mg/ml of C. villosus, C. siliqua and H. umbellatum methanol extracts, respectively, compared with 95% incidence in the untreated control.

Design/methodology/approach - Systematic analysis of published empirical studies and theoretical models about mindfulness in organizational contexts. The summary of analysis is listed below. Collective mindfulness, defined by Weick et al. (1999) as the capability to induce a rich awareness of discriminatory detail and a capacity for action is a fundamental resource for effectively respond to environment changes (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002; Levinthal and Rerup, 2006; Weick and Sutcliffe, 2006). If so, in an ever-changing environment to promote collective mindfulness is to develop and support a crucial key to organizational success and survival. Therefore, one might ask what can organizations do to cultivate collective mindfulness? What are the fundamental conditions under which it emerges? The body of literature on collective mindfulness describes two different ways of fostering mindfulness within organizations. One answer rests in Weick's and colleagues (Langer 1989 and Weick et al. 1999) theory about mindfulness in High Reliable Organizations (HRO). In this approach mindfulness is promoted through processes of improving quality and quantity of attention towards work processes and organizational environment. A different answer argues that artistic processes can also promote collective and individual mindfulness, by removing objects from the automatism of perception, by defamiliarizing predominant beliefs and assumptions and allowing people to see more and see differently (Langer 1989, 2005; Barry & Meisiek, 2010. Moreover, art as one of the most important ways of expression of human feelings and values can provide processes and tools to approach emotional dynamics and aesthetic aspects within organization, which are also expected to broaden people's perception and people's willingness to be open to new ways doing things (Schiuma, 2011; Barry, 1994; Barry, 1996; Berthoin Antal, 2009). Originality - We integrate into a single model of mindfulness in organizations, two separate and apparently disparate theories about mindfulness in organizations which hitherto have been developed separately (Arts and High Reliability Organizations). Practical implications - The most important implication is to identify the key conditions and processes under which collective mindfulness can be developed within organizations.","[Tavares, Susana Vasconcelos] Univ Europeia Laureate Int Univ, Dept Management, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal; [da Cunha, Viera Joao] Univ Europeia Laureate Int Univ, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Europeia; Universidade Europeia,"Tavares, SV (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia Laureate Int Univ, Dept Management, Estr Correia 53, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal.",,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,20,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1338,1349,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200103,0

Most of it is exported to third countries. Indeed, according to FAO, Spain is considered the first citrus exporter worldwide. Spanish citrus production is mainly destined to fresh market. Due to the high fruit quality standards demanded by this market, citrus pest management has to provide fruit with almost no pest presence or damage and at the same time, with minimal pesticide residues. International market demands place Spanish citrus industry in an unbeatable position to implement area-wide Integrate Pest Management (aw-IPM) programs. In the last years the citrus producing area that adopted IPM programs has dramatically increased. In 2012 more than 19% of the production already followed IPM regulations and that was a 5-fold increment relative to 2005. The current trend indicates that the number of growers adopting IPM systems will keep increasing over the coming years. The present article summarizes the current status of Spanish citrus IPM, how pests are hierarchized according to their biological control and which are the available IPM tools for growers. Large scale implementation of this management approach will permit Spanish citrus production to make a qualitative leap in a society that seeks for healthier eating habits and more environmental friendly production systems.","[Urbaneja, Alberto; Tena, Alejandro; Monzo, Cesar] IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Moncada, Spain; [Jacas, Josep A.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Unitat Associada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Urbaneja, A (通讯作者)，IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Moncada, Spain.",urbaneja_alb@gva.es,"Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011; Monzo, C./O-5248-2019; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014","Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685; Monzo, C./0000-0003-3247-7412; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334",,,,,17,2,3,0,16,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1075,1082,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600135,0

In order to reverse the negative trends various forms of association in the wood industry have been proposed to propel growth of this important economic sector. In the last fifteen years in Croatia a significant interest has been dedicated to strategic alliances. Policymakers believe there is a great potential in clusters. The wood industry has been identified as one of the key strategic industries; different activities have been developed and a number of measures have been adopted by the Government to support the establishment of clusters. So today we have as many as 12 active clusters, which can be divided into two groups: operational clusters and clusters that represent advisory bodies and as such have no productive function. The main objective of this paper is the presentation of mapping of clusters in Croatia's wood industry with a specific purpose of assessing clusters from the eastern part of Croatia (Wood Cluster of Vukovar-Srijem County, and Wood Cluster of Slavonia). If we compare the findings of our research with data obtained by the relevant international institutions, it follows that most of the clusters in Croatia do not have the required characteristics for mapping which makes their statistical monitoring and eventually management difficult. The paper includes an example of managing operational cluster in Austria with the aim to highlight the possibilities and benefits which can be achieved by clustering. For the purpose of this paper the method of deck research was used. All relevant scientific and professional papers by domestic and foreign authors related to the research topic were studied. The results were interpreted by using the methods of comparative analysis, compilation, description, classification, inductive and deductive analysis and case study method. The aim of this research is to compare strategic management of wood clusters in Croatia with successful wood clusters in European union (Austria).","[Zekic, Zdravko; Samarzija, Luka; Dukic, Nikolina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zekic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",zzekic@efri.hr; luka.samarzija@efri.hr; ndukic@efri.hr,"Samaržija, Luka/R-1808-2018; Zekić, Zdravko/R-1848-2018; Dukic Samarzija, Nikolina/S-4727-2018","Dukic Samarzija, Nikolina/0000-0002-5158-5809; Zekic, Zdravko/0000-0002-2865-8731; Samarzija, Luka/0000-0001-7286-2126",,,,,8,0,0,1,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,133,141,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100013,0

We have shown by Monte Carlo experiments that the concentration in an norm entropy-based procedure improves considerably the other suggested entropy-based determination of the optimal decomposition level considered. The simulation results also show that the concentration in an norm entropy-related criterion and the maximum scale decomposition method performs better in most cases and provides evidence of the power of the wavelet methods.

Drawing on new research (including previously unpublished interview data), the article first discusses established modes of environmental governance before examining the growth of China's renewables sector through the theoretical lens of the developmental state'. The article then analyses renewable energy policy design and implementation in China, illustrating how top-down command and control strategies have successfully diffused renewable energy technology from a standing start. We argue that (1) China's distinct approach to the sector differs from Western modes of environmental governance and (2) this has revealed a new path towards renewable energy diffusion that authoritarian states in particular might regard as an attractive alternative to participatory models.","[Chen, Geoffrey C.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Polit Wissensch, Essen, Germany; [Lees, Charles] Univ Bath, Dept Polit Languages & Int Studies, Bath, Avon, England",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Bath,"Chen, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Polit Wissensch, Essen, Germany.",c.s.j.lees@bath.ac.uk,"Chen, Geoffrey C./M-4930-2017","Chen, Geoffrey C./0000-0002-0868-3745; Lees, Charles/0000-0002-3517-2211",,,,,75,72,77,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It views social constructivism as a profoundly normative mode of political inquiry which seeks to discern, interrogate and elucidate the contingency of social, political and economic change - restoring politics (broadly understood) to processes and practices typically seen to be inevitable, necessary and non-negotiable. More controversially, perhaps, it also sees social constructivism, after both Berger and Luckmann and Searle, as ontologically institutionalist. Social constructivism, it is argued, has its origins in the attempt to establish the ontological distinctiveness of institutions as social' (as distinct from natural or brute') facts. This leads it to a distinct understanding of the relationship between actors and the environment (both natural and social) in which they find themselves and to its characteristic emphasis on the ideational mediation of that relationship. That in turn leads it to a particular type of analytic purchase on political economic realities, reflected in its distinctive emphasis on interpretive ambiguity, the social construction of political and economic imperatives and on disequilibrium. The argument is illustrated and developed further through an elucidation of the implications of such a social constructivism for the analysis of the period of crisis through which we now acknowledge ourselves to be living.","[Hay, Colin] Sci Po, Polit Sci, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Hay, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Polit Sci, Paris, France.",colin.hay@sciencespo.fr,,"Hay, Colin/0000-0001-6327-6547",,,,,37,79,94,4,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Differences include how causal and spurious correlates are separated, how business cycle and stimulus effects are distinguished, and under what circumstances parameter estimates can be modified.","[Heim, John J.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Heim, John J.] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Heim, JJ (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA.;Heim, JJ (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",jheim@albany.edu,,,,,,,49,4,4,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

As evidence for Germany is still scarce, the purpose of this study is to identify the effect of maternal employment on childhood overweight in Germany using two sets of representative micro data. We further explore potential underlying mechanisms that might explain this relationship. In order to address the selection into maternal full-time employment, we use an instrumental variable strategy exploiting the number of younger siblings in the household as an instrument. While the OLS models suggest that maternal full-time employment is related to a 5 percentage point higher probability of the child to be overweight, IV estimates indicate a 25 percentage points higher overweight probability due to maternal full-time employment. Exploring various possible pathways, we find that maternal full-time employment promotes unhealthy dietary and activity behavior which might explain the positive effect of maternal employment on child overweight to some extent. Although there are limitations to our IV approach, several sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We consider rankings of any type (i.e., with any number of candidates at each rank), and define a class of success functions that assign probabilities to all rankings of a given type for each configuration of candidates' efforts. Our framework can be interpreted as the probabilistic choice of a committee that allocates a given set of prizes following a mix of objective and subjective criteria, where the former depend on candidates' efforts while the latter are random.

Due to the importance of cotton production for the Greek primary sector and national economy, a field research was conducted in August 2015 in the Region of Thessaly, central Greece, where half of Greek cotton is traditionally produced. The results prove that there is a significant environmental awareness from cotton producers, showing a strong preference in using coated cotton seeds instead of granular insecticides. This preference is more intense for younger farmers with large agricultural holdings. This is the first field research conducted for this issue, which verifies the need for further examination of farmers' beliefs, perceptions and attitudes on similar issues for different crops, like maize.","[Vlontzos, George; Athanassiou, Christos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytoko, Volos, Greece; [Duquenne, Marie Noelle] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Volos, Greece",University of Thessaly; University of Thessaly,"Vlontzos, G (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Fytoko, Volos, Greece.",gvlontzos@agr.uth.gr,"Duquenne, Marie Noelle/ABH-5240-2020; Athanassiou, Christos/ABE-8867-2020","Duquenne, Marie Noelle/0000-0002-3189-5658; Vlontzos, George/0000-0002-0735-2274",,,,,44,1,1,1,4,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2016,15.0,4,,,,,90,96,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW1DD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402229200010,0

To this end, we employ several forecasting models to test for REITs predictability under a flexible framework that captures parameter instability. Apart from the traditional factors examined in relevant studies, we also account for a series of sentiment and uncertainty indicators that may be significant predictors of REITs returns, especially during turbulent times when sentiment determines investment decisions to a greater extent. The empirical results indicate that the good predictors of REITs returns vary over time and over the forecast horizons. Our results suggest that economy-wide indicators, monetary policy instruments and sentiment indicators are among the most powerful predictors of REITs returns. In economic terms, an investment strategy that is based on our forecasts outperforms a buy and hold strategy. The issue of the most suitable forecasting method is also discussed in detail.

Second, we employ real-time data in addition to commonly used revised vintages. Third, we investigate the role of consumer confidence in a rich information context. We produce forecasts of consumption expenditures with and without consumer confidence measures using a dynamic factor model and a large, real-time, jagged-edge dataset. In a robust way, we establish the important role of confidence surveys in improving the accuracy of consumption forecasts, manifesting primarily through the services component.

Instead, a more flexible approach to acte clair requirements is taking shape, while the Court is simultaneously reminding national courts that its discretion on preliminary reference issues is not unlimited.

Each subgroup uses the simple majority rule; a correct decision benefits the subgroup. This study demonstrates that, assuming all individuals' equal competence for all tasks and a sufficiently large group size, when each individual's probability of making a correct decision exceeds one-half, the optimal group composition is an equal number of individuals per subgroup. Conversely, it is less than one-half, the assignment produces the lowest benefit. We also find that when decision-making costs exist, if the competence is greater than one-half, the possibility that the performance of division of labor outweighs that of plenary voting increases as the cost increases. On the other hand, if the competence is less than one-half, division of labor is always more beneficial than plenary voting.

Findings show poor working conditions are the most significant determinants of accidents and illnesses occurring at work, while having a fixed-term (temporary) contract is not significant. Other significant determinants of work safety are: not being new to the workforce; dissatisfaction with the current job; gender; and a latent proneness observed with occurrence of accident on the way to work.

We use a choice-based stated preference survey where crowding levels are represented by means of specially designed pictures, and use these data to estimate flexible discrete choice models. We assume that the disutility associated with travelling under crowded conditions is proportional to travel time. Our results are consistent with and extend previous findings in the literature: passenger density has a significant effect on the utility of travelling by public transport; in fact, the marginal disutility of travel time in a crowded vehicle (6 standing-passengers/m(2)) is 2.5 times higher than in a vehicle with available seats. We also compare the effects of different policies for improving bus operations, and the effect of adding crowding valuation in cost-benefit analysis. In doing that, we endogenise the crowding level as the result of the equilibrium between demand and supplied bus capacity. Our results indicate that important benefits may be accrued from policies designed to reduce crowding, and that ignoring crowding effects significantly overestimate the bus travel demand the benefits associated with pure travel time reductions.

I provide new evidence on the impact of obesity on employment status by treating the dependent variable as a as a multinomial choice variable. Using data from a representative English survey, with measured height and weight on parents and children, I define employment status as one of four: working; looking for paid work; permanently not working due to disability; and, looking after home or family. I use a multinomial logit model controlling for a set of covariates. I also run instrumental variable models, instrumenting for Body Mass Index (BMI) based on genetic variation in weight. I find that BMI and obesity significantly increase the probability of not working due to disability. The results for the other employment outcomes are less clear. My findings also indicate that BMI affects employment through its effect on health. Factors other than health may be less important in explaining the impact of BMI/obesity on employment.

We also estimate whether, controlling for beauty, body size measures are related to hourly wages. We find that anthropometric attributes play a significant role in wage regressions in addition to attractiveness, showing that body size cannot be dismissed as a simple component of beauty.

Often local job creation policies focus on increasing capital through grants, low-interest financing, and other economic development incentives. Theory predicts that capital subsidies induce firm behaviors that limit their job creation effects. This paper employs the Incentives Environment Index, constructed from state constitutional provisions that limit and structure the ability of state and local governmental entities to aid private enterprises, and county panels to test theoretical predictions on county capital expenditure and input mixes as well as industry establishment shares. The results indicate the act of increasing capital subsidy tools is associated with capital-labor substitution, decreased employment density, and changes in local industry mix. Results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and measures of capital subsidy availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

(Measuring the Effect of Political Uncertainty. Working Paper, Stanford University, 2012) and Baker et al. (Political Uncertainty: A New Indicator. CentrePiece 2012; 16(3): 21-23), who estimate the dynamic effects of a shock to a newly constructed surrogate measure of political uncertainty (PU) on the US economy. Comparable to their results we demonstrate that a shock to PU has pervasive effects on the dynamic evolution of the US economy. Using an estimated structural dynamic factor model we find that more globally integrated markets exhibit significantly more pronounced responses than other measures of real economic activity. Impulse responses reveal a small but statistically significant flight-to-safety' effect, depressing government bond yields across the entire term structure following a shock to PU. Forecast error variance decompositions are predominantly composed of supply, demand, and PU shocks over all horizons, with PU shocks contributing less and supply shocks contributing more to forecast errors at longer horizons. Technology shocks, by contrast, are found to affect forecast accuracy closer to impact with quickly decaying contributions over extended forecast horizons.

It discusses different types of non-injury incident collected in a recent survey of UK cyclists. These are everyday occurrences that in some cases have a substantially negative impact on cycling experiences. This article explores the impact of different incident types on people cycling both immediately and in the future. It analyses what near misses tell us about cyclists' experience of problems related to road user behaviour and culture, and infrastructural conditions for cycling. The paper explores what cyclists experiencing near misses think might have prevented them. Based on this and on a comparison with common types of injury incidents, summary recommendations are made for policy and future research. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Drawing on boundary theory, it investigates the main career-relevant domains and boundaries, and the motivations and structural conditions that influence boundary crossing or having a career within a specific domain among a sample of professional pharmacists. The qualitative study shows that careers are enacted within a number of relevant domains and are shaped by a range of boundaries such that boundarylessness and embeddedness are co-existing career dimensions. It also reveals how even within a professional population careers are embedded within diverse social and cultural contexts that impose differing constraints on career mobility. The article therefore provides a fuller, more nuanced understanding of career boundaries and contemporary careers.","[Rodrigues, Ricardo] Kingston Business Sch, Human Resource Management, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England; [Guest, David] Kings Coll London, Dept Management, Org Psychol & Human Resource Management, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Budjanovcanin, Alexandra] Kings Coll London, Dept Management, London WC2R 2LS, England",Kingston University; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London,"Rodrigues, R (通讯作者)，Kingston Business Sch, Dept Management, Room Kh Bs305,Kingston Hill Campus, Kingston Upon Thames KT2 7LB, Surrey, England.",r.rodrigues@kingston.ac.uk,,"Budjanovcanin, Alexandra/0000-0003-1648-2190; Rodrigues, Ricardo/0000-0003-4796-2509",,,,,33,45,52,5,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Industrial goods can be consumed, invested, exported, and imported. Tourism services produced in the tourism sector are consumed by foreigners and domestic residents. The two sectors are linked via consumption of domestic residents, which, in the Keynesian tradition, depends positively on disposable income, and via investment. An increase in sectoral production (industrial and tourism sector) stimulates consumption and investment expenditures. Output is completely demand determined, and resulting in unemployment in case of a lack of demand is Keynesian. Via the production function, changes in sectoral outputs translate into changes in unemployment. Focusing on the short run, prices are held constant. The article provides a graphical apparatus to analyze different types of sectoral demand shocks. We investigate an increase in foreigners' demand for domestically produced tourism services (inbound tourism). Depending on the exchange rate regime or monetary policy, sectoral outputs and unemployment rates may move in tandem or in opposite directions. Our results support the popular view that tourism can reduce unemployment.","[Schubert, Stefan F.] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Schubert, SF (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, TOMTE, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.;Schubert, SF (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",stefanfranz.schubert@unibz.it,,,Free University of Bozen,Free University of Bozen,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author is grateful for financial support from the Free University of Bozen.",,40,1,1,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

These incentive policies (carbon tax, feed-in tariff, premium payment and quota system) are modeled in a simplified radial power network, using price-responsive demand. Most results are derived assuming an oligopolistic Cournot competitive framework and that the costs of subsidies are covered by the government (i.e., customers do not directly pay back for the subsidies). We compare the different RE incentive schemes at different congestion levels in terms of energy prices, RE generation, CO2 emissions, and social welfare. We find that the effectiveness of the different incentive schemes varies significantly depending on the market structure assumed, the costs of renewable energy, and the subsidy recovery method considered. Subsidy policies (FIT and premium payments) are more cost effective in reducing CO2 emissions than those policies that apply penalties or taxes, when assuming oligopoly competition and that customers do not directly pay back for the subsidies. Quota and carbon tax policies are more cost effective when assuming that either a perfectly competitive electricity market takes place or customers directly pay back for the subsidies. Additionally, we show that, in the feed-in tariff system, there is an interaction among incentive levels for renewable energy technologies. Given a certain feed-in tariff price to be set for a particular renewable technology, this price influences the optimal feed-in tariff price to be set for another technology.","[Perez de Arce, Miguel; Sauma, Enzo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Perez de Arce, Miguel; Sauma, Enzo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Global Change UC, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Sauma, E (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Santiago, Chile.;Sauma, E (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Global Change UC, Santiago, Chile.",esauma@ing.puc.cl,"Sauma, Enzo E/N-7013-2013","Sauma, Enzo E/0000-0002-8555-9123","FONDECYT/Regular [1100434, 1130781]; College of Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC); CONICYT",FONDECYT/Regular(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); College of Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC); CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"The research reported in this paper was partially supported by the CONICYT, FONDECYT/Regular 1100434 and 1130781 grants.

The transportation sector alone contributes to 22% of carbon emissions, of which 80% are contributed by road transportation. In this paper we investigate the potential private car greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and social welfare gains resulting from upgrading the bus service in the Greater Beirut Area. To this end, a stated preference (SP) survey on mode switching from private car to bus was conducted in this area and analyzed by means of a mixed logit model. We then used the model outputs to simulate aggregate switching behavior in the study area and the attendant welfare and environmental gains and private car GHG emissions reductions under various alternative scenarios of bus service upgrade. We recommend a bundle of realistic bus service improvements in the short term that will result in a reasonable shift to buses and measurable reduction in private car emissions. We argue that such improvements will need to be comprehensive in scope and include both improvements in bus level of service attributes (access/egress time, headway, in-vehicle travel time, and number of transfers) and the provision of amenities, including air-conditioning and Wi-Fi. Moreover, such a service needs to be cheaply priced to achieve reasonably high levels of switching behavior. With a comprehensively overhauled bus service, one would expect that bus ridership would increase for commuting purposes at first, and once the habit for it is formed, for travel purposes other than commuting, hence dramatically broadening the scope of private car GHG emissions reduction. This said, this study demonstrates the limits of focused sectorial policies in targeting and reducing private car GHG emissions, and highlights the need for combining behavioral interventions with other measures, most notably technological innovations, in order for the contribution of this sector to GHG emissions mitigation to be sizable.

Coercion by a great power thus seems to be a prerequisite for successful international cooperation in tax matters. Great power status is based on internal market size. Governments become substantially more likely to use this power through sanction threats against tax havens when two factors coincide: (1) domestic constraints preventing a shift of the tax burden to labor and consumption and (2) scope for redistributive cooperation benefitting great power banks or multinationals.

The proof of this result uses the fact that the core of an associated compensation matching game with constraints is nonempty.","[Lazarova, Emiliya] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Borm, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Warandelaan 2,POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of East Anglia; Tilburg University; Tinbergen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Lazarova, E (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",E.Lazarova@uea.ac.uk; P.E.M.Borm@uvt.nl; arantza.estevezfernandez@vu.nl,"LAZAROVA, EMILIYA/AAI-6647-2020","Estevez-Fernandez, Arantza/0000-0002-3747-4010; Borm, Peter/0000-0002-2710-1827",,,,,18,9,10,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2016,81.0,1,,,,,53,71,,10.1007/s11238-015-9524-x,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DM9IW,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376680100004,0

The results show that, in a sample of 15 OECD countries, institutional heterogeneity is a significant determinant of the response of household consumption to country-specific income shocks. This is consistent with the idea that institutionally provided social insurance may help increase income stability when people differ in their ability to access financial markets and smooth consumption fluctuations.","[Lo Prete, Anna] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy; [Lo Prete, Anna] CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",University of Turin,"Lo Prete, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy.;Lo Prete, A (通讯作者)，CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy.",,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2016,39.0,6,,,,,755,771,,10.1111/twec.12325,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DP6TW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378632800002,0

By employing classification and regression trees, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines (SVM), Bayes net, and naive Bayes; we compare the ability of various learning techniques with the conventional statistical method in predicting sovereign credit ratings. Experimental results suggest that all the techniques excluding SVM have over 90 % accurate prediction. According to within one and two notch accurate prediction measure, the prediction performance of SVM also increases above 90 %. These findings indicate a clear outperformance of AI methods over the conventional statistical method. The results have many implications for the practitioners in credit scoring industry. Amidst the regulatory measures that encourage individual credit scoring for international financial institutions, these findings suggest that up-to-date AI methods serve quite reliable technical tools to predict sovereign credit ratings.","[Ozturk, Huseyin] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Anafartalar Mah,Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06050 Ankara, Turkey; [Namli, Ersin] Istanbul Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34320 Istanbul, Turkey; [Erdal, Halil Ibrahim] Turkish Cooperat & Coordinat Agcy TIKA, Ataturk Bulvari 15, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Istanbul University; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Ozturk, H (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Anafartalar Mah,Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06050 Ankara, Turkey.",huseyin.ozturk@tcmb.gov.tr; enamli@istanbul.edu.tr; halilerdal@yahoo.com,"NAMLI, ersin/F-6757-2013","NAMLI, ersin/0000-0001-5980-9152; Ozturk, Huseyin/0000-0001-7511-1061; Erdal, Halil Ibrahim/0000-0001-5037-5829",,,,,48,9,9,3,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Using Swedish linked registry data, 1987-2005, we analyze all pregnancies that resulted in an HG admission and/or a live birth, 1.65 million pregnancies in all. Consistent with the T-W hypothesis, we find that: (i) HG is associated with poor maternal condition as proxied by low education; (ii) HG in the first two months of pregnancy is associated with a 7% point increase in live girl births; and (iii) HG affected pregnancies have a 34-percent average rate of inferred pregnancy loss, higher among less educated women.

This article reconceptualizes micro-level analyses that focus on the effect of unemployment through a framework of costs, risks and the mediating role of labour market institutions. It then derives several hypotheses and tests them on the results of the previous three EP elections in all EU Member States. Findings from multiple regression analyses indicate that unemployment, real GDP growth, debt and deficits have no statistically significant effect on far-right party support at the national level. By contrast, labour market institutions influence costs and risks: where unemployment benefits and dismissal regulations are high, unemployment has no effect, but where either one of them is low, unemployment leads to higher far-right party support. This explains why unemployment has not led to far-right party support in some European countries that experienced the severity of the 2008 eurozone crisis.","[Halikiopoulou, Daphne; Vlandas, Tim] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Halikiopoulou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Polit, POB 218, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.;Halikiopoulou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, IR Whiteknights, POB 218, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",d.halikiopoulou@reading.ac.uk,"Vlandas, Tim/AAH-2583-2019","Vlandas, Tim/0000-0003-4245-3932",,,,,61,37,38,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

These political and economic changes had major social consequences, among others unemployment and a sharp decrease in real personal income. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible relationship between stress in adult men, measured by the Allostatic Load, and the socio-economic deterioration during the first part of the economic transition. The Allostatic Load included eleven markers assessing adverse nutritional intake, cardiovascular activity, inflammatory processes, and lung, hepatic and renal functions. The results indicate a significantly higher risk of metabolic dysregulation in men examined after 1990, compared to men from previous years. After adjustment for socioeconomic variables and lifestyle variables, men examined in 1991 had a 31% greater risk of higher Allostatic Load compared with men examined in 1985 (OR = 1.31; p = 0.0541), in 1992, this risk was 50% greater (OR = 1.50; p < 0.01), and in 1993, the risk was 66% greater (OR = 1.66; p < 0.05). The conclusion is drawn that significantly more stressogenic factors for men were those directly connected with the financial situation of their families, than a sudden but short increase of prices for goods and services.

I provide a model of sexual behavior decision-making under uncertainty and estimate the structural parameters of the model using nationally representative survey data from Zambia on HIV testing decisions before and after the introduction of ART. The empirical results indicate that although the introduction of ART appears to have increased HIV testing rates by upwards of 50 percent, the ART allocation process may have limited the prevention benefit of ART-induced testing. Simulation results show that eliminating this prevention inefficiency while holding the supply of ART constant would increase the prevention impact of ART-induced testing more than four-fold. More generally, the analysis indicates that existing studies which examine universal testing or quasi-experimental testing programs understate the efficacy of standard voluntary counseling and testing programs.

Prior authors have reported evidence of a significant difference between long run energy fuel prices and energy service prices. However, this is the first analysis to pose this question beginning in the context of colonial America. In accord with earlier work focused in the U.K. the paper reports a significant divergence in fuel and service prices. In this setting real heating fuel prices increased over the 220 year time period by a factor of between 15 and 20. In contrast, heating service prices increased by a factor of two. Expressed in labor units, heating service prices have fallen in Vermont by 25%, while fuel prices were essentially flat. Finally, over this two century time period in Vermont and the U.K., the rate of change in service prices expressed in labor units is remarkably similar: -1.1% and -0.9%, per annum, respectively.

The conclusion, in the spirit of Kant, is that it is political participation which is most effective in reducing military spending. Other elements of democracy play a distant secondary role.

Finally, the short-run dynamics of headship reflect the business cycle, implying that household formation could increase substantially as the labor market recovers.","[Paciorek, Andrew] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Paciorek, A (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",an-drew.d.paciorek@frb.gov,,"Paciorek, Andrew/0000-0003-0435-0721",,,,,16,19,23,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2016,44.0,1,,,,,7,40,,10.1111/1540-6229.12085,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144200001,0

This is the first article to rigorously test the rationality of expectations of house price change using survey data. Using a panel data set of the Wall Street Journal economic forecasting survey from 2007 through 2012, I test for unbiasedness and efficiency by implementing the econometric methodology proposed in Davies and Lahiri (1995) in the setting of a three-dimensional panel data set. I find that, after controlling for aggregate shocks, nine of the 47 forecasters have statistically significant biases, and their biases are all negative, indicating that they persistently predict too high of a change in house prices. The hypothesis of efficiency cannot be rejected, suggesting lack of evidence for inefficient use of information. When the year 2012 is excluded, the unbiasedness test shows that 25 of the 47 forecasters systematically over-predicted house price changes. Again, the hypothesis of efficiency cannot be rejected.","[Zhang, Jing] Moodys Analyt, W Chester, PA 19380 USA",,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Moodys Analyt, W Chester, PA 19380 USA.",zhang.728@osu.edu,,,,,,,5,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2016,44.0,1,,,,,236,257,,10.1111/1540-6229.12095,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144200006,0

This paper examines the official Chinese media discourse on the EU's actorness' and partnership with China. This helps to bridge the gap between international relations and media studies by linking government foreign relations to media discourse. It argues that China's relations with the EU should be characterized neither as a case of a Capability-Expectations Gap' (Hill, ) nor as an Expectation Deficit' (Tsuruoka, ), but should rather be seen as a matter of Reflexive Expectations' by China. The media analysis shows that China's changing national identity, interests and perception of the EU's capability at various times and in various situations influence expectations.","[Zhang, Li] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Polit Philosophy Language & Commun Studies, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Jasmine_Zhang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,71,21,22,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In recent years, the development of the cave tourism industry throughout the country and the emergence of its positive and negative impacts have attracted the interest of rural development experts, local managers and scholars. Most research is related to scientific studies in caverns, but there has been insufficient study of the profiles of visitors, expenditure patterns and problems experienced by cave tourism destinations. The main aim of this study is to analyse the determinants of the expenditure of same-day visitors on cave tourism, the socio-economic characteristics of the tourists and their attitudes towards the Ballica Cave as a tourist destination. Data were collected from 598 visitors via a questionnaire survey. The double log function was used to determine visitor expenditure on cave tourism. The geographical position of the cave and characteristics of the visitors were taken into consideration when specifying the model. According to the findings, the effect of household income on visitor expenditure was positive but not significant. Distance, age, level of education and gender were important determinants of expenditure. In addition, the majority of respondents thought that the advertising of the Ballica Cave was inadequate. Relatives, friends and neighbours were the main information sources for visitors to the cave.","[Akca, Hasan; Cafri, Reyhan] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-18100 Cankiri, Turkey; [Sayili, Murat] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, TR-60240 Tokat, Turkey",Cankiri Karatekin University; Gaziosmanpasa University,"Akca, H (通讯作者)，Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-18100 Cankiri, Turkey.",hasanakca@karatekin.edu.tr; murat.sayili@gop.edu.tr; reyhanc@karatekin.edu.tr,"AKÇA, Hasan/ABI-4534-2020; cafrı, reyhan/AAA-7230-2022","CAFRI, REYHAN/0000-0002-6271-5330",,,,,32,6,6,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

(ii) However, we typically obtain a trade off in volatilities such that a simultaneous stabilization of inflation and output is not possible.

Most EB-5 investors are Chinese. We focus primarily on Chinese investor attitudes toward the program, using a nonrandom survey of 85 potential investors who invested in projects in Cleveland, Ohio. The survey was administered in Chinese. Our survey found that Chinese wealthy private business owners are mainly participants in EB-5 for acquiring a U.S. green card on behalf of their young adult children.

Following Guiso et al. (Q J Econ, 2009; henceforth GSZ), we capture the exogenous variance in bilateral trust by measuring physical dissimilarities ('somatic distance') between country pairs. We employ seven alternative somatic distance indicators in addition to the one by GSZ. As they are all equally valid instruments, it should not matter in two-stage least-squares estimations which one of them we use at the first stage. However, bilateral trust significantly affects international trade only if employing the indicator by GSZ.

Officials in these organizations can play a different two-level game, arising from their simultaneous negotiations within their personal transnational networks and their official duties in their host organizations. In each domain, they can act in ways that improves their outcomes in the other one - informal understandings facilitate subsequent formal agreement, while actions taken within their organizations implement and cement what had been negotiated informally. Multi-organizational innovation can thus be coordinated even in the absence of formal action to do so. This process is illustrated through an examination of the role of an informal transnational network in the shifting of the policies of the government of India and major aid donors in the 1960s.","[McKeown, Timothy J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"McKeown, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA.",,,,Social Science Research Council,Social Science Research Council,This research was supported by a grant for foreign policy studies from the Social Science Research Council.,,119,3,3,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In particular, Kuan Chung, Hsun Tzu and Ssu-ma Ch'ien explicitly discussed economic issues related to the division of labour, contributing sophisticated analysis on the subject. In this article, we first examine Kuan Chung and his followers' fairly interesting analysis of the economies of agglomeration of specialists, and Ssu-ma Ch'ien's deep insight into the Taoist invisible hand of the market in coordinating the division of labour. The common ground between them is a sound understanding of the role of market exchange in facilitating the social division of labour, but the latter goes much further in appreciation of the spontaneous market order. We then turn to Hsun Tzu's profound scholarship of specialised learning or doing and his Confucian theory of the origin of social division, highlighting, in particular, his Confucian notion of natural equality and utilitarian account of the formation of society. Similarity in profundity and influence notwithstanding, of greater interest, appears to be the remarkable differences between the Chinese scholars and the philosophers of classical Athens in respect of their study of the division of labour, and we therefore investigate how and why the Chinese treatment contrasts thus sharply with the Greek/Europeans.","[Sun, Guang-Zhen] Univ Macau, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Sun, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Macau, Peoples R China.",gzsun@umac.mo,,,,,,,43,6,6,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Labour market reform is addressed by the so-called third arrow of Abenomics - the economic revitalisation policy of the current Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Relatively low unemployment rate does not indicate the good condition of the Japan's labour market, when considering rapid aging of population, decline in average nominal wages and expansion of part-time jobs. Moreover, there is a problem of underutilisation of female, youth and elderly labour forces, lacking an access to regular employment, then, higher wages, better access to social security system and vocational stability. Womenomics, aimed at promotion of female labour forces, enhanced the public debate on the social justice and gender equity, however, without significant changes of social norms and institutional models it is hard to eradicate the outdated, rigid scheme of employment. Moreover, it is hard to provide new permanent jobs in the country trapped in the long-term vicious circle of stagnation and deflation. Therefore, effective aggressive monetary policy and fiscal consolidation need to accompany structural reform of the labour market to make the latter feasible and successful in the long-term.","[Bobowski, Sebastian] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bobowski, S (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.bobowski@ue.wroc.pl,"Bobowski, Sebastian SB/Q-3884-2018",,,,,,8,0,0,1,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,195,204,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100019,0

The long-term solution to crowding has been more prisons; the short-term solution is early release. Early release programs can be effective when they balance the savings of reduced prison costs against the costs of recidivism by released convicts. This paper uses historical data to investigate how prison officials altered their early release policies in the face of prison crowding and rising real detention costs. The empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prison officials make use of information about the risks of recidivism revealed at trial and during incarceration to make informed decisions about whom to release and when.

We find that results differ markedly depending on the specific types of policies in place, reflecting different impacts of uncertainty. As a result, the recent reform to the EU-ETS system that has established the Market Stability Reserve (MSR), effective in 2019, requires to appropriately fine-tune the direct RES-E support schemes. We show that this may involve moving away from feed-in tariffs towards feed-in premia. Our results suggest that the schemes currently adopted in Germany and in Italy, broadly based on feed-in premia for large generators and on feed-in tariffs for the small ones, could well fit also the post-MSR EU carbon mitigation policy. To the contrary, other countries (e.g. France and the U.K.) may have to modify their support schemes as the MSR will become operational.","[Boffa, Federico] Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy; [Clo, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy; [D'Amato, Alessio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, DEF, Rome, Italy; [D'Amato, Alessio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEIS, Rome, Italy; [D'Amato, Alessio] Interuniv Res Ctr, SEEDS, Rome, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Milan; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Boffa, F (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy.",federico.boffa@unibz.it; stefano.clo@unimi.it; damato@economia.uniroma2.it,,"Boffa, Federico/0000-0002-2394-9441; D'AMATO, ALESSIO/0000-0003-2344-0458","Free University of Bolzano [WW 2062]; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","Free University of Bolzano; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We thank Berardino Cesi, the two guest editors and two anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.

These countries are small open economies at a similar level of economic development and at the same time they have adopted different exchange rate regimes. This makes it possible to investigate whether the reactions of an economy to real and nominal shocks are indeed in line with the degree of exchange rate flexibility. The stochastic macroeconomic model of a small open economy is used to derive the long-term zero and sign restrictions. These are used to identify supply, demand, financial and monetary shocks within the Bayesian structural vector autoregression models with common serial correlations. For each economy a separate BSVAR model is estimated on quarterly data spanning from 1998 to 2013 for relative GDP, interest rate differential, real exchange rate and relative price level. Our findings lend some support to the hypothesis that the flexible exchange rate acts as a shock absorber: under the floating rate it is the exchange rate that reacts to real shocks rather than output, whereas under the fixed rate output responses are stronger. Moreover, the burden of adjustment to financial shocks in Hungary and Poland rests on the nominal exchange rate and on the relative price level and the real interest rate differential in Bulgaria and Slovakia.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Wroblewska, Justyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; eowroble@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Wróblewska, Justyna/AAA-8421-2020","Wróblewska, Justyna/0000-0002-9789-2601; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,15,1,1,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,26,35,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000003,0

To do so, we need to define what it means for a computational game, which is a sequence of games that get larger in some appropriate sense, to represent a single finite underlying extensive-form game. Roughly speaking, we require all the games in the sequence to have essentially the same structure as the underlying game, except that two histories that are indistinguishable (i.e., in the same information set) in the underlying game may correspond to histories that are only computationally indistinguishable in the computational game. We define a computational version of both Nash equilibrium and sequential equilibrium for computational games, and show that every Nash (resp., sequential) equilibrium in the underlying game corresponds to a computational Nash (resp., sequential) equilibrium in the computational game. One advantage of our approach is that if a cryptographic protocol represents an abstract game, then we can analyze its strategic behavior in the abstract game, and thus separate the cryptographic analysis of the protocol from the strategic analysis.","[Halpern, Joseph Y.; Pass, Rafael] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Seeman, Lior] Harvard Univ, Ctr Res Computat & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; Harvard University,"Halpern, JY (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",halpern@cs.cornell.edu; rafael@cs.cornell.edu; lior.seeman@gmail.com,,,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1214844] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [0911036] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,16,3,4,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,681,698,,10.1145/2940716.2940733,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300059,0

The main aspect of the strategy is virtualization and automation of the entire value chain of the company by distributing the decisions over it while looking for the overall effectiveness of the chain. i4.0 expands from Germany to other countries such Switzerland and Great Britain. These countries also endeavour to gain leadership in industry. The Czech Republic also needs to establish appropriate conditions to support companies on the adoption of this new approach in order to keep and improve its competitive advantage in these areas.

It is important to note that viral marketing can be realized in any format, on any media or on any Web site. To make viral marketing successful, it is necessary to devise a quality content and the same content focus to a particular demographic group for which the content is created. If we want to achieve the interest of consumers or potential user of a product or service for content that is created, content must intrigue them in a way that recognizes the passion of the one that created the content.

Unpaid work, either in the form of volunteering or mutual help, can also serve as an indicator of social capital. Studies on unpaid work confirm its significant economic contribution that is not being reflected in any of the traditional indicators of economic development. In the article, we analyse the data on unpaid work collected through a survey in the Slovak households in relation to the characteristics of social capital in Slovakia and make a distinction between two types of social capital and their differing contribution to economic development.

The research finds that veterans' organisations operate in a restricted environment, though our analysis shows that their agency has mattered, largely due to their political connections. The investigation reveals those mechanisms through which Russian veterans' organisations act as brokers.","[Kulmala, Meri] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; European Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",University of Helsinki; European University at Saint Petersburg,"Kulmala, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,"Kulmala, Markku/I-7671-2016; Tarasenko, Anna/F-8165-2016","Kulmala, Markku/0000-0003-3464-7825; Tarasenko, Anna/0000-0001-7327-5695; Kulmala, Meri/0000-0002-3834-9385",Finnish Center of Excellence 'Choices of Russian Modernisation'; Center for Modernization Studies of the European University at St Petersburg,Finnish Center of Excellence 'Choices of Russian Modernisation'; Center for Modernization Studies of the European University at St Petersburg,"We are deeply indebted to Professor Vladimir Gel'man for his insights, comments and suggestions on the manuscript, as well as to two anonymous reviewers of the essay.

(H2) - financial institutions in the Polish market draft their CSR reports in different ways, which obstructs their comparability. In order to verify hypothesis (H1), regulations of the Directive 2014/95/EU and specialist literature have been reviewed. In order to verify hypothesis (H2), the author has conducted research into a group of financial institutions in the Polish financial market by examining and analysing CSR reports compiled in 2010-2015 with regard to quality of the information, in particular, its usefulness and comparability.

This paper employs simultaneous equation models to address the potential endogeneity caused by joint determination between managerial compensation and leverage. We find that cash compensation will motivate risk-taking behavior in capital structure decision of the firm. And ownership type will moderate the relationship between managerial cash compensation and capital structure. Management of government controlled firms will be less risk-taking on capital structure decisions although the same level of cash compensation is provided.

We start with basic platform of the Black-Scholes model for a put option with strike price and maturity given, which assumes the underlying asset to follow a geometric Brownian motion. Pricing American options requires, due to the early exercise feature of such derivative contracts, the solution of optimal stopping problems for the price process. Unlike in the European case, the pricing function of an American option does not satisfy a partial differential equation, but a partial differential inequality, or a system of inequalities. Recasting such problem into a variational inequality problem is the next step, which is given in detail. We mention briefly the functional space which provides natural framework for weak formulation of American put option pricing problem.

The Monte Carlo study is presented in order to show the robustness of moment estimates especially for the skewed contaminated data. A sample from lognormal distribution is contamined by 0 %, 5 %, and 10 % of observations from other lognormal distribution. The situation is described by the finite mixture model with two components. The component membership is supposed to be known and one lognormal distribution is fitted into data as well as the mixture of two lognormal distributions. Results are compared with normal distributions fitted into logarithms of data. The dependence on the percentage of censored data is also of interest (censoring from 0 % (complete data) to 30 % of observations in the sample of 500 observations). All computations are done in R program.","[Mala, Ivana] Univ Econ, W Churchill Pl 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Malá, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Pl 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",malai@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,4,4,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1159,1169,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100115,0

Our study focuses on a comparison of Basch' work to the economic thought of the representatives of the Czechoslovak government and President Edvard Bend, in particular the proposals for the post-war economic order. The prevailing idea proposed the combination of democracy, which was understood as the only guarantee of freedom, and economic planning.

Furthermore, we derive the direct rebound effects that explain the degree to which a fuel price increase is offset in the form of greater fuel use and/or travel due to improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency. For this purpose, we use and compare two alternative econometric approaches: the error correction model (ECM) and the dynamic model. Our initial assumption is that one should not be indifferent with respect to the approach used to derive elasticities. The data used are for the period 1980-2011. Our results indicate the following: (1) the dynamic model fits the data better than the ECM model does; (2) the estimated elasticities of fuel demand with respect to price and income are -0.26 and 0.06 in the short run and -0.36 and 0.09 in the long run. For travel demand, the respective elasticities are -0.11 and 0.06 in the short run and -0.24 and 0.13 in the long run, implying inelastic demands for fuel and travel demand; and (3) rebound effects indicate that 0.26% and 0.06% of fuel savings as a result of fuel price increase will be offset in the form of more fuel use in the short run and in the long run, respectively, if fuel efficiency increases by 1%. Our policy recommendations are that policies should not be indifferent to the methods used to derive elasticities. We contend that it is crucial to seriously consider rebound effects in policy making because basic elasticity estimates exaggerate the impact of fuel price increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Originally, these trade preferences had at least two policy goals: (i) to increase export volumes for developing countries and thereby boost their export earnings and (ii) to facilitate export diversification. While extensive research has confirmed that the first of these goals is typically met, the second goal seems to have been largely forgotten by researchers as well as in policy circles. The aim of this paper was therefore to analyse the impact of the EU's non-reciprocal trade preferences for developing countries on export diversification. Our estimation results suggest that some trade preference programmes, such as the Generalised Schemeof Preferences (GSP), lead to increasing ranges of export products. By contrast, preferences offered to Mediterranean countries typically have no significant effects, and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) preferences actually have negative effects towards the end of our time period, suggesting that ACP countries may respond to preferences by specialising into fewer goods.","[Persson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Maria] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wilhelmsson, Fredrik] Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University,"Persson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.;Persson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,"Norwegian Research Council; Centre for European Studies at Lund University; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2006-0131:1, W2009-0352:1]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Centre for European Studies at Lund University; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"The authors are very thankful for insightful and useful comments from an anonymous referee.

Regulations of law distinguish two categories of foreigners.

The second category includes other foreigners, who are obliged to obtain a permit to purchase a property, apart from a list of exceptions indicated by a legislator. Foreigners purchased 17 thousand hectare of land properties in total within recent 5 years, with only 2800 hectare of agricultural and forest properties, which constitutes nearly 17% of all properties purchased.

Yet pre-War Japan was an outlier. Though its level of external debt was not sustainable, Japan issued many government foreign loans to cover its current account deficits, was never affected by currency crises, and was never forced to suspend convertibility. We argue that, from the late nineteenth century until just before World War I, Japan and Britain engaged in a politico-economic exchange: Japan offered to protect Britain's economic and political interests in the Far East provided that Britain gave the rising Asian power access to financial markets-namely, in the City of London.

Most generation is secured through long-term contracts. Aggressive renewable energy programs have led to rapidly growing renewable capacity, mainly wind generation. Coal-fired generation has been eliminated and electricity sales have dropped. The competitive hourly market price has declined and there is a clear merit-order effect: an increase of wind generation from 500 MW to 1500 MW can be expected to decrease price by 7 CAD/MWh. However, the all-in price, which incorporates contractually guaranteed supply prices, has risen from about 60 to 100 CAD/MWh between 2009 and 2014. Operational and market integration of renewable resources has been achieved relatively smoothly.

Batak is one of ethnicities in North Sumatera Province. As an ethnicity, Bataks implement the culture as their way of life. Culture came from the ancestors who shaped culture based on their needs at the time. As time goes by and science rapidly develops, culture can be reinterpreted. One example is a way of solving the financing problem with the traditional means. Batakese believe that marriage is one of the most important phases of life. This marriage is often celebrated with the royal wedding party by inviting the family from both sides of bride and bridegroom. The family might come from each of their great-grandparents. This royal wedding is held with the amount of money, excluding the dowry (sinamot-Batak) which is bride-price that must be paid by bridegroom after negotiating between the families. In general, all of the expenses along the party become the responsibility of bridegroom side. The burden of the cost that expended by the bridegroom could be balanced from the tumpak, obligatory presents brought by the family of both bride and bridegroom. Tumpak usually consist of money that conforms to the invitee relationship with the bride and bridegroom. The other present, like amount of rice and ulos (traditional woven cloth) could be sold by the family to gain some money.

Although the primary role of the EU budget lies in its allocation function, the EU budget, mainly through the cohesion policy, causes redistribution effects on national and regional levels, with the objective of reducing economic and social disparities across European regions and countries. This paper contributes to the relevant literature by not only considering the effects of the cohesion policy, but also by explicitly incorporating other EU fiscal transfers and EU budget contribution as explanatory variables in a setting of a panel econometric model of conditional beta-convergence. The analysis on a sample of 28 EU countries allows for the consideration of policy implications of the effect of EU budget expenditures on EU economic convergence. We have found that the contribution to the EU budget did not improve the growth rates. EU budget expenditures as a whole have small negative impact on the growth rate, although this result is influenced by the business cycle fluctuations during this period.","[Vyrostova, Eva] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Econ & Management Publ Adm, Popradska 66, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Vyrostová, E (通讯作者)，Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Econ & Management Publ Adm, Popradska 66, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",eva.vyrostova@upjs.sk,"Výrostová, Eva/AEJ-8710-2022","Výrostová, Eva/0000-0003-2446-2421",,,,,15,2,2,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,2037,2045,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100199,0

The research is focused on individual components of two tax burden indicators. A tax quota is used in most of the similar studies and World Tax Index is an alternative. Instead of concentrating on the aggregate effects of tax burden, we rather focus on the effects of individual taxes in both indicators. These individual indicators are separately added into the augmented endogenous growth model with physical capital approximation as well as other control variables. The dynamic panel regression is used as a method to analyze any tax burden effects in a time period of 2000-2013. Main findings of this paper are that product taxes show the most significant adverse effects on the economic growth. Results also indicate that property taxes can positively stimulate economic growth rate. There is a certain contradiction between our results and majority of similar empirical studies. Any distortionary tendencies of corporate income tax quotas are identified as statistically insignificant in analysis and have no effects on economic growth.","[Zimcik, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Zimcík, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",petr.zimcik@mail.muni.cz,"Zimcik, Petr/JVN-5892-2024",,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,928,933,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500159,0

The quantities are calculated on the basis of instantaneous amplitudes and phase differences, which are computed here with the help of the non-decimated discrete analytic wavelet transform. We show that the coefficients constitute an interesting add-in to the statistical apparatus of examining business cycle synchronization. The PLVs correct the information provided by the coherency and correlation coefficients for the influence of amplitude changes and are of use in examining phase synchronization of business cycles, which is important in forecasting the effectiveness of a common monetary policy. By contrast, the ACCs are based solely on amplitude information and have the interpretation of phase-adjusted correlation coefficients, which can be used to evaluate stabilization policies or to forecast these policies' effectiveness. The methodology is applied to examine cyclical synchronization of 20 European Union (EU) countries. We show, among other things, that during the run-up to the euro both amplitude and phase synchronization increased, with the former tending to change more rapidly. Furthermore, for the new EU members an EU effect is identified in both types of cyclical synchronization with the euro area.","[Bruzda, Joanna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Bruzda, J (通讯作者)，Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",Joanna.Bruzda@uni.torun.pl,"Bruzda, Joanna/G-8937-2014; Bruzda, Joanna/ABF-8475-2021; Bruzda, Joanna/AAD-5199-2020","Bruzda, Joanna/0000-0002-7451-3592; Bruzda, Joanna/0000-0002-7451-3592",Polish National Science Center [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/02716],Polish National Science Center,"Polish National Science Center, (Grant/Award Number: DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/02716).",,46,3,3,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The authors use 1,065 observations from a visitor exit survey (in two waves: 2006 and 2012) to examine the determinants of prioritizing destination choice or travel mode in the holiday decision-making process. Estimating a multinomial model, they find that the decision structure of those individuals who prioritize destination is different from that of those who prioritize the travel mode. The paper also contributes to research on the intention to return to a destination related to the intention to repeat the same holiday formula. The authors distinguish between those tourists who prioritize destination choice and those who prioritize the travel mode. Through an estimated sequential model, they present the results of the revisiting patterns for these two groups.","[Garcia, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Juaneda, Catalina; Sastre, Francesc] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain; [Maria Raya, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Tecnocampus Mataro Maresme,Ernest Lluch 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Pompeu Fabra University,"Raya, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Tecnocampus Mataro Maresme,Ernest Lluch 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain.",jaume.garcia@upf.edu; nati.juaneda@uib.cat; josep.raya@upf.edu; fsastre@uib.cat,"Villar, Jaume Garcia/D-7140-2013; SASTRE, FRANCISCO/G-2187-2016",,,,,,46,11,12,2,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

To this end, the Hansen and Seo (2002) threshold cointegration approach and the nonlinear causality test of Kyrtsou and Labys (2006) are applied to assess these relationships. Results obtained clearly do not support the view that unemployment and shadow economy are neutral with respect to each other, except in the case of Bolivia, China, Colombia, Pakistan, Philippines and Portugal, where a neutral relationship is found. We find, however, considerable evidence of bi-directionality in Finland and Sweden. This indicates that high levels of unemployment lead to high levels of shadow economy and vice versa. We also find clear evidence of unidirectional causality running from unemployment to shadow economy in the US, Jamaica and Venezuela which implies that, in these three countries, a faster rate of unemployment promotes a higher share of the underground economy in total GDP. Further, the causality relationship appears to be uni-directional but reversed for Chile. Overall, our findings suggest that policy implications of the unemployment-shadow economy relationships should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the test-dependent and country-specific results.","[Saafi, Sami; Farhat, Abdeljelil; Mohamed, Meriem Bel Haj] Univ Monastir, EAS Fac Econ Sci & Management Mahdia, Mahdia Hiboun Cite Sidi Messaoud, Mahdia Hiboun Cite Sidi 5111, Mahdia, Tunisia",Universite de Monastir,"Saafi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Monastir, EAS Fac Econ Sci & Management Mahdia, Mahdia Hiboun Cite Sidi Messaoud, Mahdia Hiboun Cite Sidi 5111, Mahdia, Tunisia.",samisaafi@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,76,8,9,0,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

A mother is supposed to possess significant knowledge in such domains as medicine, paediatrics, child psychology and nutritional science. She must also be a competent consumer of goods and services for children in order to conform to common understandings of good' motherhood. In the Russian context parenthood is semantically more associated with motherhood, a legacy of Soviet gender policy and of contemporary Russian gender culture. The mother is perceived as the primary parent and the spokesperson acting on behalf of the child in his or her best interests. The actualisation of a mother's identity represents a powerful symbolic and discursive instrument of legitimisation of women's activity in the public sphere. Motherhood gives Russian women, especially those from lower classes, resources to improve their social status and to apply for numerous, albeit low, social allowances and benefits. At the same time, we know rather little about the way motherhood is produced on the subjective level and what discursive practices are at work in the process of Russian women becoming mothers.","[Shpakovskaya, Larisa] Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg 192171, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Shpakovskaya, L (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Sedova St,55A, St Petersburg 192171, Russia.",lshpakovskaya@hse.ru,,,"Scientific Foundation of Higher School of Economics, Russia [12-05-0017, 14-01-0162]","Scientific Foundation of Higher School of Economics, Russia","The essay uses the materials of two projects: 'Parenthood in contemporary Russia: policy, values, practices' (Scientific Foundation of Higher School of Economics, Russia, 2012-2013, grant No. 12-05-0017) and 'Parents' educational aspirations as a mechanism of the reproduction of social inequality' (Scientific Foundation of Higher School of Economics, Russia, 2014-2015, grant No. 14-01-0162).",,37,4,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2015,67.0,10,,,SI,,1571,1586,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1101210,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,CZ3LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367004900004,0

Measure-by-measure updating of such a set of measures upon acquiring new information is well known to suffer from problems. To deal with these problems, we propose using weighted sets of probabilities: a representation where each measure is associated with a weight, which denotes its significance. We describe a natural approach to updating in such a situation and a natural approach to determining the weights. We then show how this representation can be used in decision making, by modifying a standard approach to decision making-minimizing expected regret-to obtain minimax weighted expected regret (MWER). We provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by MWER both in the static and dynamic case.","[Halpern, Joseph Y.; Leung, Samantha] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Leung, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",halpern@cs.cornell.edu; samlyy@cs.cornell.edu,,,"NSF [IIS-0812045, IIS-0911036, CCF-1214844]; AFOSR [FA9550-08-1-0438, FA9550-09-1-0266]; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) [FA9550-12-1-0040]; ARO [W911NF-09-1-0281, W(INF-14-1-0017)]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1214844] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [0911036] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AFOSR(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI)(MURI); ARO; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"The authors thank Joerg Stoye for useful comments.

After the real-effort task, subjects were asked to state their retrospective beliefs about their performance in public given feedback about their performance in private, and about the performance of other subjects in public given the average performance in private. Between-subjects, we varied the compensation that participants would receive for providing accurate performance estimates.

We apply this assessment framework to two cases with two phases each: (1) the negotiations on the 2010 Nagoya Protocol on genetic resources to the Convention on Biological Diversity and (2) the negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change toward the 2009 Copenhagen and 2011 Durban climate summits.

Previous evidence suggests that the costs of peer punishment can be outweighed by the benefits of higher cooperation if (i) there is a sufficiently long time horizon and (ii) punishment cannot be avenged. However, in most instances in daily life, when individuals interact for an extended period of time, punishment can be retaliated. We use a design that imposes minimal restrictions on who can punish whom or when, and allows participants to employ a wide range of punishment strategies including retaliation of punishment. Similar to previous research, we find that, when punishment cannot be avenged, peer punishment leads to higher earnings relative to a baseline treatment without any punishment opportunities. However, in the more general setting, we find no evidence of group earnings increasing systematically or significantly over time relative to the baseline treatment. Our results raise questions under what conditions peer punishment can be an efficient mechanism for enforcing cooperation.","[Engelmann, Dirk] Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Engelmann, Dirk] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Expt Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Engelmann, Dirk] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Engelmann, Dirk] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Nikiforakis, Nikos] New York Univ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Copenhagen; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Ifo Institut,"Engelmann, D (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",dirk.engelmann@hu-berlin.de; nikos.nikiforakis@nyu.edu,"Engelmann, Dirk/H-2943-2014",,Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,"Financial support from the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne is gratefully acknowledged.

We found that given current rates of growth, total emissions would increase by up to 37.47 %. Furthermore, this study quantitatively analyzes the influence factors pertaining to Anhui province's carbon emissions. The results show that population effects on increases in carbon emissions have declined gradually, and that increased energy consumption has promoted a reduction of carbon emissions; it was also found that carbon emission intensity has stimulated an increase in carbon emissions to a degree larger than population effects have. Economic development, additionally, has stimulated an increase in carbon emissions. This study also puts forward some measures by which to reduce carbon emissions in Anhui province, and they involve improvements to the energy structure, an increase in energy efficiency, and a strong focus on high-energy-consumption and high-emission industries.","[Song, Ma-Lin; Zhou, Yuan-Xiang] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Song, ML (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",songml@aufe.edu.cn,,,"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0595]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171001, 71222106]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [10YJC630208]; Key Foundation of Natural Science for Colleges and Universities in Anhui, China [KJ2011A001]; Soft Science Foundation of Anhui, China [12020503063]; Key Foundation of National Research in Statistics of China [2011LZ023]","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Key Foundation of Natural Science for Colleges and Universities in Anhui, China; Soft Science Foundation of Anhui, China; Key Foundation of National Research in Statistics of China","We appreciate the support of the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-12-0595), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71171001 and 71222106), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 10YJC630208), the Key Foundation of Natural Science for Colleges and Universities in Anhui, China (No. KJ2011A001), the Soft Science Foundation of Anhui, China (No. 12020503063), and the Key Foundation of National Research in Statistics of China (No. 2011LZ023).",,22,28,28,4,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This approach can measure the environmental performance of undesirable outputs (pollutants). Technological heterogeneity can be taken into account simultaneously by taking a metafrontier approach. First, the concept of a generalized metafrontier directional distance function is proposed for the model. Second, several standardized composite indicators of environmental performance are developed. Third, the metafrontier directional distance function is estimated by solving a series of data envelopment analysis models. Finally, various regions in China are empirically examined, and the results and their implications are discussed. The results indicate substantial heterogeneity in environmental performance across regions, and some policy suggestions are proposed based on these results.","[Yu, Yanni] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China; [Choi, Yongrok] Inha Univ, Dept Int Trade & Reg Studies, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Inha University,"Choi, Y (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Dept Int Trade & Reg Studies, Inharo100, Inchon 402751, South Korea.",a-yuyanni@hotmail.com; yrchoi@inha.ac.kr,"Choi, Yongrok/GRJ-6248-2022; Choi, Yongrok/AFN-7905-2022",,"National Social Science Foundation, China [12ZD213]; National Science Foundation of China [41461118]; China Postdoctoral Foundation [2014M551849]; JUFE [61152012]","National Social Science Foundation, China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); JUFE","We thank two anonymous referees for the very useful suggestions on an earlier draft of this article.

In order to contribute to this discussion, the author analyzes the Spanish case, where transition to democracy was accompanied by a comprehensive tax reform, aiming at increasing progressivity and revenue. But how effectively did it change the distribution of the tax burden? Was there a fiscal revolution? The results show that persistent regressivity (albeit decreasing) exacerbated income inequality, failing to attain convergence with more developed countries. The joint effect of the fiscal system, however, was slightly positive due to progressive social spending.","Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Hetland, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Barcelona, Spain.",storregrosa@ub.edu,"Torregrosa-Hetland, Sara/AAQ-1993-2021; Torregrosa-Hetland, Sara/JXX-3114-2024","Torregrosa Hetland, Sara/0000-0003-2082-2004",Spanish Ministry of Education's scholarship program Formacion del Profesorado Universitario; [ECO2012-39169-C03-03],Spanish Ministry of Education's scholarship program Formacion del Profesorado Universitario;,"I thank Merce Costa, Sergio Espuelas, three anonymous referees and participants at seminars in Barcelona, Uppsala, Madrid, Girona, Mexico DF and Washington DC for their comments.

It characterizes the scope of products, as well as the levels of and changes to the trade values, market shares, volumes, and prices for those goods that eventually become subject to WTO litigation. The first result is striking heterogeneity in the level of market access at stake across disputes: e.g., 14% of cases over disputed import products feature bilateral trade that is less than $1 million per year, and another 15% feature bilateral trade that is more than $1 billion per year. Nevertheless, some strong patterns emerge from a more detailed examination of the data. Both high- and low-income complainants tend to suffer important losses in foreign market access in the products that ultimately become subject to dispute. Furthermore, while the respondent's imposition of an allegedly WTO-inconsistent policy is associated with reductions, on average, to trade values, volumes and exporter-received prices, there is some evidence of differences in the size of these changes across both the different types of policies under dispute and the potential exporter country litigants. Finally, these different types of policies under dispute can have dissimilar trade effects for the complainant relative to other (non-complainant) exporters of the disputed product, and this is likely to affect the litigation allegiance of third countries.","[Bown, Chad P.] World Bank, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Reynolds, Kara M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, London, England",The World Bank; American University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，World Bank, Trade & Int Integrat DECTI, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW,MSN MC3-303, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cbown@worldbank.org; reynolds@american.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857; Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,46,35,38,3,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The rank and order conditions are commonly used in identification for simultaneous equations models. The order condition of identifiability is an easy condition to compute, though maybe difficult to remember. The application of the rank condition, due to its complicated definition and its computational demands, is time consuming and contains a high risk for errors. Furthermore, possible miscalculations could lead to wrong identification results, which cannot be revealed by other indications. Thus, a safe way to test identification criteria is to make use of computer software. Specialized econometric software can off-load some of the requested computations but the procedure of formation and verification of the identification criteria are still up to the user. In our identification study we use the program editor of a free computer algebra system, Xcas. We present a routine that tests various identification conditions and classifies the equations under study as A << under-identifiedA >>, A << just-identifiedA >>, A << over-identified A >> and A << unidentifiedA >>, in just one entry.","[Halkos, George E.; Tsilika, Kyriaki D.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Volos 38333, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Halkos, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Korai 43, Volos 38333, Greece.",halkos@uth.gr,"Tsilika, Kyriaki/E-2117-2018; HALKOS, GEORGE/AAE-4772-2020","Tsilika, Kyriaki/0000-0002-9213-3120; HALKOS, GEORGE/0000-0002-2772-5306",,,,,63,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Hence, improving competitiveness is crucial for firm survival. Competitiveness of the sector often depends on its firms meeting their production potential. This paper analyzes productivity changes in the textile and clothing industry worldwide during the period 1995-2004. A bootstrapped Malmquist approach is used to identify the respective contributions of technical change, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Moreover, differences in productivity changes across different groups of firms are statistically assessed. Our results show a relatively small overall productivity increase for both textile and clothing firms due to positive technical change, despite declines in technical and scale efficiency. Furthermore, our results indicate that productivity and its components differ for textile firms and clothing firms, for firms in countries that benefited and did not benefit from the quotas' elimination, and for firms in different regions.","[Kapelko, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Logist, Inst Appl Math, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wageningen University & Research,"Kapelko, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Logist, Inst Appl Math, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.kapelko@ue.wroc.pl; Alfons.OudeLansink@wur.nl,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",,,,,54,19,21,1,33,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To this aim, we develop an estimation and testing framework for a threshold vector error-correction model (VECM), where short-run dynamics are regime dependent and are driven by an exogenous, stationary and ergodic threshold variable. We modify a traditional Wald-type test for linearity and derive its asymptotic distribution, which turns out to be non-standard, but similar to the one proposed by Andrews [Andrews, D. 1993. Tests for Parameter Instability and Structural Change with Unknown Change Point. Econometrica 61 (4): 821-856]. Accounting for the diversity of the potential determinants of money holdings, a broad scope of money demand systems is analyzed. The linearity test confirms that money demand is not only suffering from structural breaks, but is driven by regimes governed by business cycles. Moreover, a similar pattern and a robust dating of the regimes is observed no matter the money demand system considered, offering hence a reconciling picture of previous empirical studies. From a policy perspective, our findings supports the implementation of cyclical monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.","[Lieb, Lenard] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Candelon, Bertrand] IPAG Business Sch, F-75006 Paris, France",Maastricht University; IPAG Business School,"Lieb, L (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",l.lieb@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"candelon, bertrand/0000-0002-0134-6498",,,,,39,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

In this paper we present a model to show under some circumstances that there exists a win-win situation via optimal trading when the tax burden can be dispersed. The way to absorb FTT in our model is to adjust the bid-ask spread. In our optimal trading model that considers FTT, the representative traders depend on the liquidity (market depth) they supply to weight their associated transaction cost by adjusting the spread ex post. We illustrate the analytical properties and computational solutions of our model when finding the optimal trading strategy under different market situations in order to offset FTT. We also conduct a simulation study to show the superior performance of our proposed optimal trading strategy in comparison to the alternative strategies that do not consider absorbing FTT. The results demonstrate that there is indeed a win-win situation, because financial institutions will not be worse off if such an optimal trading strategy is applied to offset FTT and reduce their transaction cost.","[Sun, Edward W.] KEDGE Business Sch, Bordeaux, France; [Kruse, Timm] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Finance, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan",Kedge Business School; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Sun, EW (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, Bordeaux, France.",edward.sun@kedgebs.com; mtyu@nctu.edu.tw,"Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021; Sun, Edward W./J-7488-2015","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327; Sun, Edward W./0000-0001-6680-0738",,,,,24,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression are used to compare the characteristics of pro-West and uncertain individuals with those of the pro-Russian/Soviet individuals, with preferences on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU) accession underlying this distinction. The results show that geopolitical identities in Luhansk have a complex political stratigraphy that includes demographic, socioeconomic, cultural, and attitudinal components. The pro-West constituency is younger, not Russian but often including members of other ethnic groups, well educated, more tolerant toward sexual minorities, generally more satisfied with life, and it also speaks better English. Conversely, those with pro-Russia/Soviet geopolitical identities are older, Russian, low educated, less fluent in English, intolerant, and unsatisfied with their lives. Uncertainty is more randomly distributed among social groups, indicating different underlying causes related to the source of the respondents' uncertainty.","[Gentile, Michael] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland; [Gentile, Michael] Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm Ctr Hlth Soc Transit SCOHOST, Huddinge, Sweden",University of Helsinki; Sodertorn University,"Gentile, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland.",michael.gentile@helsinki.fi,"Gentile, Michael/AAL-8027-2021","Gentile, Michael/0000-0001-5224-788X",Umea University (Sweden),Umea University (Sweden),The survey was funded with a personal Young Scholar's award (karriarbidrag) from Umea University (Sweden).

Prior to this crisis, the two sides operated on parallel tracks with little scope for mutual adjustment even during the economic turmoil of the 1970s. After the global financial crisis, the IMF emerged as a de facto institution of the EU thanks to European leaders' delegation of supervisory powers to both the Fund and the European Commission. The reasons for, and consequences of, this dual delegation are explored here by means of amultiple supervisor variation on the classic principal-agent-supervisor approach.","Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Hodson, D (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Polit Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,71,27,27,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This analysis is based on a sample of 12 Tunisian regional bus transport companies for the period 2000/2010. To achieve this, we chose, as an dependent variable, the variable cost and, as an independent variable, the output seats per kilometer, the prices of the input, labor and energy as well as a control variable represented by the network length. The main results show that the regional bus transport companies are economically inefficient with an almost similar magnitude regardless of the estimated model except for Green's True model (2002). This inefficiency is explained by the existence of an outdated regulation characterized by an administered wage policy where financial risk is incurred by the authorities and not by the company.

To this end, a stated preference (SP) survey was conducted in order to estimate freight shipper preferences for the main attributes that define the service offered by the different transport modes. From a methodological point of view, we focus on two critical issues in the construction of efficient choice experiments. Firstly, in obtaining good quality prior information about the parameters; and secondly, in the improved quality of the experimental data by tailoring a specific efficient design for every respondent in the sample. With these data, different mixed logit models incorporating panel correlation effects and accounting for systematic and random taste heterogeneity are estimated. For the best model specification we obtain the willingness to pay for improving the level of service and the elasticity of the choice probabilities for the different attributes. Our model provide interesting results that can be used to analyse the potential diversion of traffic from road (the current option) to alternative modes, rail or maritime, as well as to help in the obtaining of the modal distribution of commercial traffic between Spain and the European Union, currently passing through the Pyrenees.

We provide characterizations of two solutions to this problem, using Composition properties which have particularly relevant interpretations for the river claims problem. Specifically, these properties relate to situations where river flow is uncertain or highly variable, possibly due to climate change impacts. The only solution that satisfies all Composition properties is the 'Harmon rule' induced by the Harmon Doctrine, which says that agents are free to use any water available on their territory, without concern for downstream impacts. The other solution that we assess is the 'No-harm rule', an extreme interpretation of the no-harm principle from international water law, which implies that water is allocated with priority to downstream needs. In addition to characterizing both solutions, we show their relation to priority rules and to sequential sharing rules, and we extend our analysis to general river systems.","[Ansink, Erik] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ansink, Erik] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ansink, Erik] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Wageningen University & Research,"Ansink, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",erikansink@gmail.com,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013; Ansink, Erik/N-1613-2019","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845; Ansink, Erik/0000-0003-4094-2468",FP7-IDEAS-ERC [269788],FP7-IDEAS-ERC,"We thank seminar participants of the 2013 Tinbergen Workshop on Decision Making in Water Problems at VU University Amsterdam, Stergios Athanassoglou, an associate editor and two reviewers for helpful comments.

Such a systematic process of comparing benefits and costs was adopted in early years for transportation projects and it has been the subject of much refining over the years. There are still some flaws, however, in the application of the method. In this article we have studied the impact of weather conditions on traffic speed on low traffic roads often exposed to adverse weather. This is an issue not currently considered in the cost-benefit analysis of road projects. By using two analytical approaches structural equation modelling and classification and regression tree analysis the impact of the weather indicators temperature, wind speed, and precipitation on traffic speed has been quantified. The data relates to three winter Months on the European Route 6 road over the mountain pass Saltfjellet in Norway. Increase in wind speed, increase in precipitation and temperatures around freezing point all caused significant decrease in traffic speed in the case studied. If actions were taken to reduce the impact of adverse weather on traffic (e.g. by building a tunnel through the mountain) this study indicates that the road users would gain a total benefit of approximately 2,348,000 NOK (282,000 EUR) each winter at Saltfjellet if all the weather related benefits were included. We argue that this is a significant number that is highly relevant to include in CBAs. This applies both to the CBAs of new transportation projects as well as when resources are allocated for operation, maintenance, and monitoring of the existing transport systems. Including the weather related benefits would improve the application of CBA as a decision-making tool for policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the 1993 Australian Age Pension reform, which progressively increased the eligibility age for women from 60 to 65 years. We find economically significant responses to the reform. An increase in the eligibility age of one year induced a decline in the probability of retirement by 12 to 19 percentage points. In addition, the reform induced significant program substitution, with increases in enrollment in other social insurance programs, particularly the disability support pension, which effectively functioned as an alternative source of retirement income.","[Atalay, Kadir; Barrett, Garry F.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Atalay, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,"Atalay, Kadir/0000-0001-7769-1450; Barrett, Garry/0000-0002-7669-7110",Australian Research Council Linkage Project Grant [LP077495],Australian Research Council Linkage Project Grant(Australian Research Council),"We thank the editor, Amitabh Chandra; anonymous referees; and participants in seminars at Flinders University, University of Melbourne, University of South Australia, University of Sydney, University of Technology Sydney, University of Wollongong, and the conferences ACE2011, SAVE-PHF2012, ESAM2013, and CEPAR2013 for helpful comments.

Despite this, its main theoretical foundation-the Roemer model-does not indicate how to carry out, in practice, the required partition of the population into such types. This paper operationalises this definition of social types using a latent classes approach. Our specification is embedded in a probabilistic extension of the canonical Roemer model, which assumes that the relevant population consists of a finite number of latent types, from which each individual can be treated as a random draw. This makes possible the use of the full set of circumstances in the data, allows for unobserved individual heterogeneity and does not require an ex-ante specification of the number of types by the researcher. Our approach is illustrated by an empirical application featuring a large UK cohort study that was used in earlier literature to examine inequalities of opportunity in a wide array of social outcomes.","[Donni, Paolo Li] Univ Palermo, I-90128 Palermo, PA, Italy; [Gabriel Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Dias, Pedro Rosa] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",University of Palermo; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Sussex,"Rodríguez, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",juangabr@pdi.ucm.es,,"LI DONNI, Paolo/0000-0001-9074-5089; RODRIGUEZ, JUAN GABRIEL/0000-0002-0256-8789",,,,,85,17,17,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2015,44.0,3,,,,,673,701,,10.1007/s00355-014-0851-6,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CF0DY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352214200011,0

Particular attention is paid to the issue of respondents' non-random selection into contact with public officials, which may result in biased estimates. Data come from the 2010 Life in Transition Survey, covering 30 post-socialist and five Western European countries. The results suggest that the elderly tend to be less likely to bribe public officials, while people with higher income and, especially, low trust in public institutions are more likely to bribe. Several determinants of bribery - ethnic minority status, the degree of urbanisation, social trust - are context specific, i.e. they change signs or are statistically significant according to the geographical region or the type of public official.

We compare shareholder gains stemming from illegal trade subsidies with the losses generated by subsequent WTO-authorized retaliatory measures. Results indicate that the average increase in share returns of U.S. firms receiving subsidies provided by the Byrd Amendment exceeded the share declines experienced by firms targeted with associated retaliatory tariffs. Our results also suggest that retaliatory threats have a smaller impact on targeted firms when there is less certainty that protection will actually be implemented. In general, we believe that the relatively subdued response toward retaliation diminished pressure on U.S. policymakers to strike down the Byrd Amendment, as was mandated by the WTO. Apathy toward retaliation along with associated delays in WTO compliance by the U.S. may reflect a potential weakness on the part of WTO-authorized retaliation in serving as an effective political counterweight to pro-antidumping forces in the U.S.","[Liebman, Benjamin H.] St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Tomlin, Kasaundra] Oakland Univ, Sch Business Adm, Rochester, MI 48309 USA",Saint Joseph's University; Oakland University,"Liebman, BH (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",bliebman@sju.edu,,,,,,,41,7,8,1,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Interest group behaviour is highly conditional on two motivations: lobby powerful MEPs, and lobby friendly MEPs. Friendliness is based on ideology, with power shaped by institutional rules and seat share. These goals can mutually reinforce each other. However, because these two motivations exist, and because political power is not fully predictable, there are strong incentives for interest groups to lobby party groups that are non-natural allies to ensure that their policy information reaches the winning side. But, when interest groups engage in this behaviour, they retain their preference to lobby the friendliest members. The analysis is carried out on nine policy-related categories of interest group, with MEP data from three parliaments in the period 1999-2011, combined with information on the parliamentary role of 724 respondents.","Salzburg Univ, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Marshall, D (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Rudolfskai 42, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",davidjohn.marshall@sbg.ac.at,,"Marshall, David/0000-0002-6928-5708",,,,,44,45,47,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Given the limits of existing national and international regulation of TAW, particularly in developing countries, and the current deadlock in dialogue through the International Labour Organization, the argument of this article is that Transnational Private Labour Regulation (TPLR) offers a unique opportunity to establish a basis for minimum standards for temporary agency workers. This article goes on to propose three potential TPLR frameworks that, although compromised, are transparent, fair and sufficiently elastic to accommodate the distributive and political risks associated with partnership. They also offer important gains, namely increasing the competitive advantage of the PrEAs involved, minimum standards for agency workers and field enlarging' strategies for the GUFs and their affiliates.","Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England",Middlesex University,"Cotton, E (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London NW4 4BT, England.",e.cotton@mdx.ac.uk,,"Cotton, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5101-7265",,,,,70,8,8,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The method for obtaining the optimal bandwidth through a maximum pseudo likelihood function and a statistical test on whether the copula parameter is time-varying are also introduced.

These include: (1) the rise of increasingly autonomous developing states, largely as a consequence of their successful response to the Asian crisis; (2) the increasing assertiveness of their policymakers in part as a consequence of their relative success in responding to the current crisis; (3) a pragmatic adjustment by the IMF to an altered global economy in which the geography of its influence has been severely restricted, and in which it has become financially dependent on former clients; (4) the need for capital controls by countries at the extremes, i.e. those that faced implosion, and also and more importantly by those that have fared 'too well'; and (5) the evolution in the ideas of academic economists and IMF staff. The paper also explores tensions around the rebranding of capital controls as exemplified by efforts to 'domesticate' their use via a code of conduct.","Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Grabel, I (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,140,51,54,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The relative expression of each identified protein was quantified by an imager and revealed as a value relative to the pollen grain. Eleven identified proteins were remarkably up-regulated (above 1.2-fold) or down-regulated (under 0.8-fold) in treatment with self-incompatible reactions. Eight of these proteins were predicted to be self-incompatible-related proteins with the reported functions. In this study, F-box protein was identified as showing minimum expression in the treatment with crude extracts from styles of Hyuganatsu (self-incompatible reactions). The S-locus gene product expressed in pollen has been identified as an F-box protein in Solanaceae and Rosaceae. It is not clear whether a mechanism similar to that of Solanaceae and Rosaceae exists in the self-incompatible reaction in Hyuganatsu; however, the reduced expression of F-box protein may induce a self-incompatible reaction.","[Abe, Akiha; Uchida, Asuka; Sakakibara, Yoichi; Suiko, Masahito; Kunitake, Hisato] Miyazaki Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan; [Hoshino, Yoichiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",University of Miyazaki; Hokkaido University,"Kunitake, H (通讯作者)，Miyazaki Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Gakuenkibanadai Nishi, Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.",hkuni@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1267,1274,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600161,0

Process mining techniques (van del Aalst, 2011) can be used to analyze event logs, in order to extract, modify and extend process models, as well as to check conformance with respect to defined process models. Thus far, process mining techniques have been mainly used in an off-line fashion and rarely for operational decision support. Historical full traces (i.e. instances of the process which have already completed) are rarely processed on-line. Purpose - Recently, van der Aalst et al (2012) demonstrate that process mining techniques are not necessarily limited to the past, but can also be used for the present and the future. Embracing this research direction, we investigate the feasibility of a process mining approach to predict future events of running traces of business processes. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an approach that transforms the task of event forecasting for running traces into a predictive clustering task (Blockeel et al. 1998), where the target variables are the characteristics of future events expected in running traces, while the predictors are characteristics of recent events up to a certain time window. Historical traces can be processed off-line so that a predictive clustering tree (PCT) (Blockeel et al. 1998) can be mined for the predictive aim. A PCT is a tree structured model, which predicts responses of several attributes of an examples at once. In this study, it allows us to foresee the characteristics of future events of business processes based on characteristics of recent time-delayed event elements (Pravilovic et al, 2013). Originality/value - The PCT can be used to predict on-line event elements of any new running trace. Therefore, this approach puts in evidence that process models can be learned for predictive scope providing enterprises with an intelligent new monitoring/recommending service. Practical implications - This service can be used to check conformance and recommend appropriate actions of enterprises' users. The proposed approach has been implemented on the OPENNESS platform, the main outcome of the research project VINCENTE (A Virtual collective INtelligenCe ENvironment to develop sustainable Technology Entrepreneurship ecosystems). The platform is a collaborative environment which enables collective intelligence and decision making processes performed by young innovative entrepreneurs and already existing SMEs. The discovered model is used on- line to predict future action(s) of a user of the platform.","[Appice, Annalisa; Malerba, Donato] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Morreale, Vito; Vella, Giuseppe] Engn Ingn Informat SpA, Lab Ric & Sviluppo, I-90148 Palermo, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Appice, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, Via Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",,"Malerba, Donato/H-3850-2012",,,,,,6,4,4,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1442,1453,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200111,0

The potential is visible in high entrepreneurial activity of Croatian employees and the growing ratio of residents with entrepreneurial intentions. The method used is a qualitative research method - analyses of secondary data and overview and critical review of recent theoretical discussions. Today's knowledge-based society has innovation as a stronghold. The knowledge becomes tangible, useful, and marketable with the help of entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurial activity is an effective channel of realization and commercialization of knowledge-based innovation. One third of economic growth is a consequence of entrepreneurial activity. The growth of entrepreneurial activity generates new employment and prosperity of the country. Therefore, growing companies are most effective connection between entrepreneurial capacity and economic growth of each national economy. Results of international studies point out a tiny share of the growing companies in Croatia (less than 3%) as one of the major problems of entrepreneurship that is hindering economic growth of the country. However, the results of an international research project on entrepreneurship Global Entrepreneurship Monitor show high entrepreneurial activity among Croatian employees and a growing share of the population with entrepreneurial intentions. In order for present entrepreneurial ideas to come to life and take clear shape in a socially acceptable, useful and marketable innovation, a synthesis of science and industry complemented with entrepreneurial knowledge is necessary which can find support within the structures of the entrepreneurial university. The aim of this study is to point to the importance and possibilities of exploiting the synergy of different social formations and elements of the concept of entrepreneurial university in order to concretize the observed entrepreneurial capacity through conscious and aimed synergy and to contribute to the necessary increase in share of growing enterprises and spur economic growth.","[Bekic, Ivana; Saracevic, Nerma; Kurtovic, Kristina] JJ STROSSMAYER Univ, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bekic, I (通讯作者)，JJ STROSSMAYER Univ, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia.",ivana.bekic@gmail.com; nermasa@bih.net.ba; kakristina7@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,239,247,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100024,0

In order to support management processes, some organizations are establishing methodologies to evaluate their Intellectual Capital. Since the beginning of the millennium, various approaches were suggested and some of them supported with large public funds to get promoted and implemented. In order to raise awareness, some institutions offer to audit Intellectual Capital Reports. This article compares experiences of evaluating the performance of IC Management in different contexts of specialization and identifies strengths and weaknesses of audits as a means to improve legitimacy for ICR. Additionally, this article covers the challenge of how to address the new requirements of the quality management guideline in ISO 9001 in Intellectual Capital Reporting and Management. Design/methodology/approach - Because of the inherent strategic importance of Intellectual Capital Reports, public availability of documents is low. Hence, an alternative, action-research-oriented approach is chosen, even though this might result in some limitations of generality or bias. Building on literature (Mertins, 2008; Wang 2012) as well as vast practical experience from teaching and consulting projects, the authors reviewed recent developments in auditing ICRs as a means to increase legitimacy. This article focuses on case anecdotic evidence lessons learned on auditing Intellectual Capital reports and relates the finding to the suggestions of the to be released new guideline for ISO 9001. Originality/value - Four years after establishing audit guidelines for Intellectual Capital Reports, a review of initial experiences seems to be quite interesting for the science community. This article focuses on empirical experiences based on narratives from case studies and reflects on quality and audit issues with special emphasis on Intellectual Capital Reporting - made in Germany. Practical implications - The discussion on reporting on intangibles gained popularity with the initiatives of global reporting as well as integrated reporting or quality management in general. Audits or testimonies on Intellectual Capital Reports in a general interpretation therefore will find a growing market for various reasons. Additionally, the new requirements for quality management in ISO 9001 address these challenges of managing intangibles and thus will have an impact on almost all part of the business community. This paper concludes with some recommendations to be as well as requirements for audits on ICS as a challenge for further research.","Intangible Assets Consulting, London, England",,"Bornemann, M (通讯作者)，Intangible Assets Consulting, Dr Anton Schlossar Weg 16, London, England.",,"Bornemann, Manfred/JGD-7811-2023",,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1306,1315,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200100,0

Our argument originates from intellectual capital and knowledge management concepts and infuses it with insights from the fields of management control systems and communication theory, emphasizing how specific communication roles are focal points in capturing knowledge value creation and its subsequent monetization. Building on the perspective of knowledge as a flow, and postulating that value is based on knowledge-in-use - rather than knowledge possession - this paper address the research question: How can we express knowledge in such a way that it can be monetized and opened up for specific managerial interventions? Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper where we selectively combine management control systems design with communication theory, and explain how the role of communication is the missing link between high-level knowledge resource management and instrumental approaches in capturing knowledge value and allowing for a connection with monetary value. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper consists of five propositions for future research on how management accounting and control systems can be brought to bear on knowledge management if the communication aspect is given primary attention. Practical implications - We identify two fundamental premises for the monetization of knowledge resources. First, in order to be valuable, knowledge resources need to be deployed and utilized rather then be merely possessed (owned). This resonates with intellectual capital research emphasizing the need to visualize and identify knowledge process rather than measuring and managing knowledge stocks and assets. Second, following a network argument, the communication of knowledge between network nodes, implies that monetization is based on designing, developing, maintaining, and growing boundary spanning individuals/teams in conjoint specific arenas that are tasked with knowledge value creation.","[Breunig, Karl Joachim] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll, Sch Business, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Roberts, Hanno] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Accounting Auditing & Law, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); BI Norwegian Business School,"Breunig, KJ (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll, Sch Business, PB 4 St Olavs Pl, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",,"Breunig, Karl Joachim/P-5003-2019","Breunig, Karl Joachim/0000-0001-5955-3943",,,,,31,0,0,0,0,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,502,513,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200039,0

Colored peppers have become supermarket staples and regularly demand premium prices. However, there are many varieties available from which growers may choose. Two consumer-based sensory panels (n=120) were conducted to evaluate the acceptability of six bell pepper cultivars. For the visual appearance test, panelists were asked to evaluate whole peppers based on appearance and how acceptable they thought the flavor of the sample would be. Panelists were then asked to evaluate bell pepper strips for appearance, aroma, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability. A 9-point hedonic scale was used to score responses for both visual appearance and consumer acceptance tests. Fisher's Protected LSD test was utilized to separate main effect treatment means when significant differences occurred among treatments. The cultivar 'Colossal' was the most preferred pepper based on visual appearance alone. 'Colossal' is a commercial cultivar that sets green fruit, which eventually turns to red, a familiar color combination for consumers. Panelists' perceived flavor acceptability, based on visual appearance alone, closely correlated to appearance acceptability. When panelists were presented with strips alone, ratings given for visual appearance of the strips did not follow the same order as ratings for the whole peppers. 'Valencia' was found to be more visually acceptable than the other cultivars. Flavor acceptability among cultivars ranged from 6.0 to 6.7 with no difference. The texture of 'Valencia' and 'Colossal' were most preferred and also received high scores for overall acceptability when all traits were combined.

Optimal stabilization policies are identified using a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Without public intervention, price dynamics are driven by domestic productive shocks and international prices. On its own, an optimal storage policy is found to be detrimental to consumers because its stabilizing benefits leak to the world market. In contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. However, such an optimal combination is shown to entail two serious drawbacks: its distributive impacts are large compared to its efficiency benefits, and by distorting excess supply curves, it may aggravate high world price episodes.","[Gouel, Christophe; Jean, Sebastien] INRA, Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Gouel, Christophe; Jean, Sebastien] CEPII, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay,"Gouel, C (通讯作者)，INRA, Econ Publ, Paris, France.",cgouel@grignon.inra.fr; sebastien.jean@cepii.fr,"Gouel, Christophe/G-9859-2011","Gouel, Christophe/0000-0002-3946-5222; Jean, Sebastien/0000-0003-1895-0955","7th Framework Programme for Research and Development; DG-Research; European Commission [AgFoodTrade:212036, FOODSECURE:290693]; Knowledge for Change Program",7th Framework Programme for Research and Development; DG-Research; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Knowledge for Change Program,"This work was supported by the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, DG-Research, European Commission [AgFoodTrade:212036 and FOODSECURE:290693], and the Knowledge for Change Program.",,62,22,25,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Sustainability of operation process is strongly influenced by the continuity supply of raw materials and parts, as well as the production process used. Indonesian pharmaceutical industry is one industry that is full of a lot of interest because it is directly related to the public health. Moreover, almost 90% of the raw materials of pharmaceutical industry in Indonesia are imported, which means the supply chain in this industry is also highly dependent on the stability of business environment. The study was conducted on 247 pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia to determine the effect of demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, and technological uncertainty on strategic supply management and performance. The analysis showed that demand uncertainty is the only variable that does not affect the supply management strategic. Another finding is that there is influence of strategic supply management on the suppliers' performance and buyers' performance. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electronically controlled seed singulation devices can address many of the inefficiencies experienced in a mechanically driven seed metering device and have the potential to increase productivity and yield rates dramatically. This research involves the process of designing, developing, and testing the feasibility of an apparatus used to precision place single seeds in a furrow during a planting operation. The equipment incorporated is a linear solenoid actuator connected with a special draw not used with any current seed metering device yet. The design uses an electronic device (based on 555 timer) to assist the solenoid in one movement (the forth movement of the draw), the back movement being accomplished by a spring. An optical electronic device was developed to trigger the 555 timer and the solenoid. This prototype gives a glimpse of what is possible in the future of seed singulation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We argue that both firm-level variables, like organisational climate operationalized through regulative, normative and cognitive pillars, as well as individual-level characteristics, such as innovative work behaviour, employability, job demands and effort-reward fairness will affect innovative firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - This is a theory-driven paper with suggested theoretical model that is subject to theory test in the future research. Originality/value - While contemporary research has focused on organisational-level factors as drivers of firm innovativeness and on personal-level factors boosting innovation work behaviour, our research takes a further step in providing a holistic view on the innovation inside the firm. Furthermore, we suggest that multiple level of analysis, employability of the individual level and organisational climate on the organisational level, will allow to explore innovative work behaviour as well innovation firm performance in more depth. We also assume in important moderating role of job demands and effort-reward fairness on the antecedents of firm innovative performance. Practical implications - Our work has important practical implications. Our model suggest that organisational climate should have both direct and indirect effects on boosting up innovative work behaviour of employees, and as a result, innovative firm behaviour. In today's economy competition is hard and ability to create new and better services and products is a necessary condition for competitive advantage. Firm's are striving to get knowledge on how to innovate effectively, and here one should consider what organisation can do to enforce innovation of employees.","[Iakovleva, Tatiana] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Korableva, Olga] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Int Res Lab, Management Syst Modeling & IT Econ ITMO Univ, St Petersburg 197101, Russia",Universitetet i Stavanger; Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Iakovleva, T (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Stavanger Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",,"Korableva, Olga N/L-5511-2017","Korableva, Olga N/0000-0002-2699-8396",,,,,37,2,2,0,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,155,163,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200012,0

The network consists of airports and airspace/air routes between them where airlines operate their flights. Resilience is considered as the ability of the network to neutralize the impacts of disruptive event(s). Friability implies reducing the network's existing resilience due to removing particular nodes/airports and/or links/air routes, and consequently cancelling the affected airline flights. The costs imply additional expenses imposed on airports, airlines, and air passengers as the potentially most affected actors/stakeholders due to mitigating actions such as delaying, cancelling and rerouting particular affected flights. These actions aim at maintaining both the network's resilience and safety at the acceptable level under given conditions. Large scale disruptive events, which can compromise the resilience and friability of a given air transport network, include bad weather, failures of particular (crucial) network components, the industrial actions of the air transport staff, natural disasters, terrorist threats/attacks and traffic incidents/accidents. The methodology is applied to the selected real-life case under given conditions. In addition, this methodology could be used for pre-selecting the location of airline hub airport(s), assessing the resilience of planned airline schedules and the prospective consequences, and designing mitigating measures before, during, and in the aftermath of a disruptive event. As such, it could, with slight modifications, be applied to transport networks operated by other transport modes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

On the class of positive games, a relative variation of marginality is incompatible with efficiency, and together with efficiency and the invariance property with respect to the payoffs of players under a player deletion, a relative variation of BCC characterizes the proportional value and egalitarian value in a unified manner.","[Kamijo, Yoshio] Kochi Univ Technol, Dept Management, Kami, Kochi 7828502, Japan; [Kongo, Takumi] Fukuoka Univ, Fac Econ, Jonan Ku, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan",Kochi University Technology; Fukuoka University,"Kongo, T (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, Fac Econ, Jonan Ku, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan.",kongo@adm.fukuoka-u.ac.jp,,"Kamijo, Yoshio/0000-0002-2184-9594",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730174] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,14,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2015,78.0,1,,,,,77,87,,10.1007/s11238-013-9402-3,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348123800005,0

Everything seems to be well known in this area. However, this is not the case. For example the D'Hondt method can violate the quota rule from above but this effect is not analyzed as a function of the number of parties and/or the threshold used. Also, allocation methods are often implemented automatically as computer codes in machine arithmetic believing that following the IEEE standards for double precision binary arithmetics would guarantee correct results. Unfortunately this may not happen not only for double precision arithmetic (usually producing 15-16 true decimal digits) but also for any relative precision of the underlying binary machine arithmetics. This paper deals with the following new issues. 1. Find conditions (threshold in particular) such that D'Hondt seat allocation violates maximally the quota rule. 2. Analyze possible influence of rounding errors in the automatic implementation of Hare-Niemeyer method in machine arithmetic. Concerning the first issue, it is known that the maximal deviation of D'Hondt allocation from upper quota for the Bulgarian proportional system (240 MP and 4% barrier) is 5. This fact had been established in 1991. A classical treatment of voting issues is the monograph [1], while electoral problems specific for Bulgaria have been treated in [2, 4]. The effect of threshold on extreme seat allocations is also analyzed in [3]. Finally we would like to stress that Voting Theory may sometimes be mathematically trivial but always has great political impact. This is a strong motivation for further investigations in this area.","[Konstantinov, M. M.; Pelova, G.

Due to the changing lifestyle, consumers seek products that do not require long preparation. The extrusion-cooking process responds to this type of applications with an easy management of processing promising product stability and quality. Extrusion-cooking involves the extruding of granular material under high pressure and high temperature. Such a method of treatment of raw materials makes extrudates produced from natural ingredients, i.e. corn or rice, suitable for direct consumption and guarantees their prolonged shelf-life. In our study, mixtures for instant grits were prepared from corn with a rice additive of 25% and 50%. Extrudates were prepared using a single-screw extruder TS-45 (L/D=12: 1). The range of the temperatures of the extrusion process was 125/130/135 degrees C. The process was carried out with the variable screw rotation speed of 80, 100 and 120 rpm. This paper presents the results of process efficiency and energy consumption during the extrusion-cooking of instant corn-rice grits. Based on a bidirectional analysis of variance, the process efficiency, regression equation and correlation coefficients were determined for evaluating the impact of the processing conditions on selected properties.

We find that low competition, as measured by high values on the Lerner index or Boone indicator, diminishes firms' access to finance. In addition, the impact of competition on access to finance depends on the quality and scope of credit information sharing mechanisms, and better credit information mitigates the damaging impact of low competition. Overall, our paper offers consistent international evidence that supports the market power hypothesis, which argues that market power reduces access, and rejects the information hypothesis, which suggests that low competition improves access because it allows banks to internalize the investment in building firm-specific relationships.","[Love, Inessa] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Peria, Maria Soledad Marinez] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Finance & Private Sect Dev Team, Washington, DC USA",University of Hawaii System; The World Bank,"Pería, MSM (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ilove@hawaii.edu; mmartinezperia@worldbank.org,,,,,,,57,125,130,5,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

To study this effect, we make an investigation of the economy wherein default risk is present, assets are collateralized and households are risk-averse. We shall prove that the economy is in possession of an equilibrium. This proof is distinct from the existing one, in two respects: First it shows that equilibrium exists for the Leontief utility function, and second it is constructive. By constructive we mean that, on the basis of this proof, we can (and we shall) develop an algorithm for computing that equilibrium. The algorithm developed is of a path-following type. It starts from an economy which consists of several sub-economies, each with a complete market and a Cobb-Douglas utility function; and it terminates at the equilibrium of the economy under consideration.

Higher education institutions differentiate from many criteria; among these, entrepreneurial culture needs to be more understood. Its role is convergent with the quality culture role within the universities. The paper aims to highlight the role of a university entrepreneurial behaviour in the consolidation of the quality culture and management. Main objectives of the paper are: to explain the features of the universities in the contemporary context from the entrepreneurial behaviour perspective; to connect the entrepreneurial culture with the quality culture for higher education institutions; to identify main university strategic behaviours based on the role of the entrepreneurial culture. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an approach that considers several research methods. Among these, must be mentioned: descriptive analysis based on both literature review and on case studies, in order to focus on examples of good practices; comparative analysis in order to emphasize some behavioural particularities; research based on a questionnaire addressed to one of the most important stakeholders of the university - the students. Therefore, students will be invited to express how they see the university management motivation to innovate, create and take risks, etc. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence new challenges university management has to face. The originality of this paper consists of a new theoretical approach of the university management concept, in terms of an entrepreneurial behaviour organization, which means a new definition generated from practice and evidence, plus the features of the interactions between both areas of entrepreneurial culture and quality management culture in an institutional context of a modern higher education institution. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application consist of several practical implications for universities. University management will be able to better understand its role in developing strategies and implementing measures for improving processes and activities. Students will be able to support university change in a more active way, for their own benefit. Companies will be able to reconsider the relationship with universities in terms of mutual advantage.","Univ Bucharest, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Magdalena, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, 36-46 Mihail Kogalniceanu,5 Dist, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,177,187,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200014,0

Originality/value - The proposed methodology connects existing management models and norm-based management systems with concepts of knowledge asset mwant to ensure the general applicability of the IMRS concept for the business community. By showing the theoretical and practical concept of an IMRS, the research will offer a guideline for the implementation of a knowledge asset management as part of an IMRS, which become necessary in healthcare organizations to fulfill all legal and governmental requirements.anagement, controlling and reporting to an integrated management and reporting system. The theoretical part discusses the possible level of integration of different models for getting a consistent management system. The case study, as practical part, shows a concrete example of the implementation process of an IMRS with its steps, impacts and possible problems. This research delivers a contribution to a holistic knowledge asset management approach as part of the new ISO 9001: 2015 and guides users through the implementation process. Practical implications - With the expected publication of the new ISO 9001: 2015 proposal in August 2015, many knowledge management systems will be certified under this standard. By concentrating on this widespread norm- based management system, we want to ensure the general applicability of the IMRS concept for the business community. By showing the theoretical and practical concept of an IMRS, the research will offer a guideline for the implementation of a knowledge asset management as part of an IMRS, which become necessary in healthcare organizations to fulfill all legal and governmental requirements.","Bucharest Univ Econ, Inst Doctoral Studies, Dept Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nagel-Piciorus, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ, Inst Doctoral Studies, Dept Business Adm, Tache Ionescu 11,Etaj 1, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1528,1539,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200118,0

Urbanization and increasing population density as well as a concentration of economic values in flood prone areas have increased the risk in many regions. Perception of the flood hazard and the associated risks in many cases is low, if not inexistent, particularly in such areas considered to be safe, e.g. behind dams or levees. This study presents the results within the framework of European project, SMARTWATER - Babadag Town case study. The main problems registered Run-Off floods have been the lack of an integrated communication system between regional and local authorities and a lack of coordination between relevant territorial actors. Even if tools to forecast flood events are implemented Romania, most of the times they are not updated, due to the absence of a territorial network able to supply the necessary data continuously. This situation has led to an increased feeling of danger and insecurity between citizens and local authorities. After the best approach was selected, it was started the relevant territorial data collection (within project area of Babadag), data standardization and shared data bases creation, that aimed in developing a similar methodology for data harmonization and integration in the future Web GIS tool. This tool increases the information communication and availability in flood risk management and planning and will integrate the civil protection activities at European level. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this context, Romanian flora is truly an exceptional source of biological active phytocompounds, basis of new biopharmaceuticals. Data indicate that in Romania there are about 3600 higher plants (ferns and flowering plants) that grow wild and other 800 hybrid species. Amongst these, about 800 are medicinal species, some of them unique in Europe. In order to demonstrate their potential use as active ingredients in biopharmaceutical engineering, this work was aimed at revealing chemical composition, particularly polyphenols profile (HPTLC method) and antioxidant activity (DPPH method) face to potential dermal benefits (single and repeated dose tolerance test in rabbits) of two (ethanolic) extracts prepared from some less studied plant pieces of two valuable phytomedicines; leaves of chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa L.) and leaves of sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). Analytical studies have shown the occurrence of numerous polyphenols species, quercetin, gallic and caffeoylquinic acid derivates, known to have a high antioxidant potency. DPPH assay has confirmed high antioxidant activity of both vegetal extracts, even stronger than that of references, rutin and gallic acid phenolics (IC50 ranging from 2.66 to 5.08 mu g / mL). In vivo, pharmacological studies have indicated good dermal tolerance and healthy, supple and reepitelized tegument after being treated with both vegetal extracts, which has revealed their potential use as antioxidant and healing ingredients for (topic) biopharmaceuticals. Thus, while Aronia melanocarpa L. as well as Hippophae rhamnoides L. are known for their valuable fruit and seed derived products, this study proves that the (ethanolic) extracts prepared from their leaves pieces should also be taken into consideration.

Although registration of companies at a so-called virtual address is entirely in abidance with the Czech legal code, specifically with Civic Act No. 89/2012 Coll., which amends the institute of company headquarters in Section 136, fears dominate especially among the professional public that this institute markedly abets the functioning of grey-area economy. The following facts could be considered the main arguments for this hypothesis: a) these businesses often demonstrate a lower level of organization structure transparency; b) seeking out and personally contacting the proprietors and statutory representatives is for the most part hindered; c) there are encumbrances which hinder audits by administrative bodies - especially by the tax and trades licensing office.

There are lots of strategies undertaken by companies to strengthen their brands. All the things performed by those companies are strategies to strengthen their brands. It is related to the positioning and its positive impact on brand image. Here, the concept of green can be regarded as a seasoning to accompany the corporate strategy which is expected to strengthen brand image. This concept is not merely a social activity as a whole, but it leads more to strengthen the positive image obtained by the company. Brand image can be improved. The brand image of a company may improve and its possible positive consequence is that the brand can be the top of mind for customers. Nowadays, customers should be appreciated even more, meaning that their value must be raised. This can be used as a guide for companies using the concept of green in their strategies.","[Prasetyo, Mohamad Hadi] Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekonomi Ekuitas, Bandung, Indonesia",,"Prasetyo, MH (通讯作者)，Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekonomi Ekuitas, Bandung, Indonesia.",hadi.p@ekuitas.ac.id,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,13,17,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900003,0

Organic agriculture is a concept that integrates three main goals: economic profitability, social equity and environmental health. The transition to organic agriculture is a process that requires many changes and commitments at different levels: consumers, producers, institutions, policy makers, scientific institutions, etc. In the last forty years community-supported agriculture (CSA) is considered as an alternative, locally based model of economic development based on sustainability criteria. The paper analyses the process of transition to organic agriculture as an important factor of local development taking Croatia as a case study. It gives a theoretical background, the analysis of the process of development of organic agriculture in Croatia and the role of groups of CSA in fostering local development. The research presented in this paper indicates that organic agriculture could be a reliable factor of enhancing local development. Although Croatia has different possibilities of development of organic agriculture, it is faced with numerous problems (e.g. small plots, low level of farmers' educations, underdeveloped market for organic products, low level of consumer consciousness, etc). The 16 CSA groups operating in Croatia could be taken as good examples of partnership between producers and consumers, which can enhance and support local development.","[Rakitovac, Kristina Afric] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Rakitovac, KA (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula, Croatia.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,245,252,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400031,0

In Romania cases of infestation with the three mentioned species were not identified in Apis mellifera, but their presence has been reported in some neighbor countries. The purpose of this paper is to report a possible infestation with A. externus and A. dorsalis or A. vagans in Romania. The study was conducted on a total of 35 apiaries within 4 counties in Southern Romania, on samples of bees, drones and portions of honeycomb with/without brood. A single case of infestation was incidentally identified by microscopic investigation on samples of drone brood combs. Morphological aspects of the parasite investigated microscopically suspects the presence of an external mite with characteristics of Acarapis species.

In order to select key genes involved in quality we used systems biology which offers mathematical tools that include the analysis of the structure, clustering and centralities of the network. In order to have information regarding physical protein-protein interactions (PPPI) from citrus sequences, orthologous sequences of A. thaliana were used (BLASTX; reciprocal BLASTP). Literature data mining was performed, and PPPI network design was obtained using the Cytoscape software. The interactome networks thus obtained were analyzed with MCODE.

However, there are only few empirical studies which test this hypothesis. This paper adds to the literature on that topic by investigating the case of China. Using individual and community data from 1991 to 2009 waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey regression analyses suggest that after controlling for important confounding factors (1) higher income is positively related to future growth of individuals' BMI in less developed areas (i.e. BMI growth is 0.7-1.5 percentage points higher when comparing the richest with the poorest individuals), but negatively related to BMI growth in more developed areas (i.e. BMI growth is 0.8-1.6 percentage points lower for the richest individuals), and (2) that concentrations of overweight are trickling down to lower income ranks as regions become more developed. Moreover, the reversal of the income gradient appears to happen at earlier stages of development for females. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

After heat treatment, the steel samples of different treatments were taken to observation and test to get the statistical analysis of test results by changing heat treatment on the properties of the steel. Results show that the quenching treatment enhances the strength and hardness of the steel significantly. After tempering at 450 degrees C, the plasticity and toughness of steel has also been picked up. The steel has good corrosion resistance when the quenching at 980 similar to 1020 degrees C. Considering the strength, hardness, plasticity and toughness, and the heating temperature, production practice, the heat treatment treatment of quenching at 940 degrees C+450 degrees C tempering of steel samples, can make the steel obtain excellent comprehensive properties, which is of great economic significance and practical significance. In recent years, high strength low alloy steel production in our country increases year by year [1], but in the strength, quality, variety series and other aspects there is a gap with foreign advanced level, so it is still a considerable number to import high strength and toughness steel[2-6]. Many foreign researchers already can more accurately predicate and calculate HSLA(high strength low alloy) steel high temperature deformation with microstructure-property prediction method [7-8], and get steel hardened by controlling the morphology of ferrite, even having a better effect than the Peierls-Na-barro strength and solid-solution strengthening[9-10], Japan in terms of earthquake-resistant building steel represents the world advanced level, has developed a series of high-intensity strength 590-1275MPa seismic reinforcement[11]. Q345B steel is the largest output and the most widely used high-strength low-alloy steel in our country, Q345B steel-solidified shell plasticity will be low at high temperature, and is prone to produce intergranular cracks under strong cooling intensity and uneven cooling condition[12]. Both domestic and foreign metallurgical workers are unclear to the performance and microstructure changes of continuous casting slab in high temperature treatment [13]. However quenching and tempering can eliminate residual stress inside, steady microstructure, adjust the hardness, strength, plasticity and toughness [14]. According to the performance requirements in different environments, exploring quenching and tempering treatment, fully tapping potential performance of Q345B steel, and obtaining high level-mechanical properties and excellent performance of various materials, is the development trend of new generation of steel materials[15], can greatly enhance the value of materials.","[Wang, Biao; Chen, Shifu; Chen, Wenkai] Northeastern Univ, Qinhuangdao Branch, Sch Resources & Mat, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China,"Wang, B (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Qinhuangdao Branch, Sch Resources & Mat, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China.",wangbiao320@163.com; chensf93@163.com; chenwenkai3006@126.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-62520-97-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2015,29.0,,,,,,385,390,,,,,,6,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BD9JW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364788100083,0

The most common application is to drive consumer behavior with respect to products or services. However, political and ideological advertising has been increasing in the last decades. Different models has been proposed to investigate dynamic advertising problems in business and economics fields. Since the effect of advertising is not instantaneous we present a fractional order model to explain and understand advertising with two components: awareness and trial advertising. In the fractional model the next state depends not only upon its current state but also upon all of its previous states. In order to deal with the fractional derivatives of the model we rely on the Caputo operator and use a predictor-corrector method to numerically approximate the fractional derivatives.","[Chen-Charpentier, Benito; Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Math, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto] Univ Los Andes, GMM, Fac Ingn, Merida, Venezuela; [Arenas, Abraham J.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Matemat & Estadist, Monteria, Colombia",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Los Andes Venezuela,"González-Parra, G (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Math, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.;González-Parra, G (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, GMM, Fac Ingn, Merida, Venezuela.",bmchen@uta.edu; gcarlos@ula.ve; aarenas@correo.unicordoba.edu.co,"TAWIL, ABRAHAM JOSE ARENAS/AAI-7347-2021; Chen-Charpentier, Benito/AAJ-9287-2020; Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto/H-9461-2019","Chen-Charpentier, Benito/0000-0001-6377-4968; Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto/0000-0001-5847-678X; ARENAS TAWIL, ABRAHAM JOSE/0000-0003-3106-1271",,,,,25,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In contrast, this study is one of the first to analyze and model the destination choice behaviors of pedestrians within an entire region. Using about 4500 walk trips from a 2011 household travel survey in the Portland, Oregon, region, we estimated multinomial logit pedestrian destination choice models for six trip purposes. Independent variables included terms for impedance (walk trip distance), size (employment by type, households), supportive pedestrian environments (parks, a pedestrian index of the environment variable called PIE), barriers to walking (terrain, industrial-type employment), and traveler characteristics. Unique to this study was the use of small-scale destination zone alternatives. Distance was a significant deterrent to pedestrian destination choice, and people in carless or childless households were less sensitive to distance for some purposes. Employment (especially retail) was a strong attractor: doubling the number of jobs nearly doubled the odds of choosing a destination for home-based shopping walk trips. More attractive pedestrian environments were also positively associated with pedestrian destination choice after controlling for other factors. These results shed light on determinants of pedestrian destination choice behaviors, and sensitivities in the models highlight potential policy-levers to increase walking activity. In addition, the destination choice models can be applied in practice within existing regional travel demand models or as pedestrian planning tools to evaluate land use and transportation policy and investment scenarios.

Is foreign technological convergence an important source of wage polarization? To answer this question, we build a multicountry Schumpeterian growth model with heterogeneous workers, endogenous skill formation, and occupational choice. We show that convergence produces polarization through business stealing and increasing competition in global innovation races. Quantitative analysis shows that these channels can be important sources of U.S. polarization. Moreover, the model delivers predictions on the U.S. wealth-income ratio consistent with empirical evidence.","[Cozzi, Guido] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Impullitti, Giammario] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England",University of St Gallen; University of Nottingham,"Cozzi, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,34,17,18,0,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This study aims at providing a first explanation of this effect. Research from other fields suggests that affective reactions might be able to explain behavioral intentions and responses towards technology, and that these affects vary depending on age levels. By examining a sample of 1603 participants representative for Germany (in terms of biological sex, age, and education) we found evidence that affective responses towards automotive cars (i.e., anxiety and pleasure) explain (i.e., mediate) the effect of biological sex on willingness to use them. Moreover, we found that these emotional processes vary as a function of respondent age in such a way that the differential effect of sex on anxiety (but not on pleasure) was more pronounced among relatively young respondents and decreased with participants' age. Our results suggest that addressing anxiety-related responses towards automated cars (e.g., by providing safety-related information) and accentuating especially the pleasurable effects of automated cars (e.g., via advertising) reduce differences between men and women. Addressing the anxiety-related effects in order to reduce sex differences in usage intentions seems, to be less relevant for older target groups, whereas promoting the pleasurable responses is equally important across age groups.

Various characteristics of the chosen travel modes have been found to influence trip experiences; however, apart from the chosen modes, travelers' variability in mode use and their ability to vary have not been investigated in the trip satisfaction literature. This current paper presents an analysis of commuting trip satisfaction in Beijing with a particular focus on the influence of commuters' multimodal behavior on multiple workdays and their modal flexibility for each commuting trip. Consistent with previous studies, we find that commuting trips by active modes are the most satisfying, followed by trips by car and public transport. In Beijing, public transport dominates. Urban residents increasingly acquire automobiles, but a strict vehicle policy has been implemented to restrict the use of private cars on workdays. In this comparatively constrained context for transport mode choice, we find a significant portion of commuters showing multimodal behavior. We also find that multimodal commuters tend to feel less satisfied with trips by alternative modes compared with monomodal commuters, which is probably related to their undesirable deviation from habitual transport modes. Furthermore, the relationship between modal flexibility and trip satisfaction is not linear, but U-shaped. Commuters with high flexibility are generally most satisfied because there is a higher possibility for them to choose their mode of transport out of preference. Very inflexible commuters can also reach a relatively high satisfaction level, however, which is probably caused by their lower expectations beforehand and the fact that they did not have an alternative to regret in trip satisfaction assessments.

In order to test the theories, we conduct event studies of the impact of elections on the interest rates on government bonds for 122 elections in 19 countries. The efficient market hypothesis states that rational markets immediately incorporate all information relevant to asset prices. According to psychology, human decision-making is quasi-rational. Market actors should be slow to accept evidence that conflicts with previously held opinions, leading them to under-react to new information. We show that markets under-react to elections and that under-reaction is greater in majoritarian countries because they provide more information to the market. Assuming fully rational markets underestimates the impact of elections and variations in impact across political systems. Most of the literature on market constraint assumes rational markets and may thus be underestimating the extent of market pressure in the aftermath of elections and its distribution across different types of electoral systems. Our results suggest that markets can calculate risk around elections, but are slow to do so, thereby suggesting that the role of uncertainty and the resort to heuristics is relatively minor.","[McMenamin, Iain; Breen, Michael] Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin, Ireland; [Munoz-Portillo, Juan] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge, England",Dublin City University; University of Cambridge,"Breen, M (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin, Ireland.",michael.breen@dcu.ie,"; Breen, Michael/N-7051-2016","McMenamin, Iain/0000-0002-1704-390X; Breen, Michael/0000-0002-5857-9938",,,,,85,3,3,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In addition to the customary coverage of in-vehicle time in review studies, this paper covers valuations of walk time, wait time, service headway, parking space search time, departure time switching, time in congested traffic, schedule delay early and late, mean lateness and the standard deviation of travel time. Valuations are found to vary with type of time, GDP, distance, journey purpose, mode, the monetary numeraire and a number of factors related to estimation. Model output values of time compare favourably with earnings data, replicate well official recommended values obtained from major national studies, and are transferable across countries. These implied monetary values serve as very useful benchmarks against which new evidence can be assessed and the meta-model provides parameters and values for countries and contexts where there is no other such evidence.

We use the novel World Input-Output Database (WIOD) that provides bilateral and bisectoral panel data for 39 countries and 35 sectors for 1995-2009. We examine growth in relative South-North labour intensities (South-North convergence) for 31 industrialised source and eight emerging recipient countries.

GMM and GLS estimations corroborate the results. Policies that improve various of the identified aspects of absorptive capacity are more promising than policies that select only one. Elevating the absorptive capacity of emerging economies to the maximum level in the world would halve the South-North gap in labour intensities within a couple of decades if it were solely achieved through the trade channel.,"[Huebler, Michael] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Huebler, Michael] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Glas, Alexander] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Leibniz University Hannover; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Hübler, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.;Hübler, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",,,,state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK),state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK).

This new system allocates veto power to the European Parliament and the Council, in which Member State expert groups are consulted without having a formal vote. The Council fears that the absence of formal voting will tempt the Commission to ignore Member State input in the expert groups. This article investigates to what degree this fear is justified. To what degree do formal voting rights affect the consultation of Member State experts? On the basis of interviews with Member State experts who participate both in expert groups as well as in comitology committees, we demonstrate how consultation patterns differ between the two settings.","[Siderius, Katrijn; Brandsma, Gijs Jan] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Brandsma, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Governance, Bijlhouwerstr 6, NL-3511 ZC Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.j.brandsma@uu.nl,"Siderius, Katrijn/GLV-5690-2022",,,,,,35,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The authors have gathered a unique panel data set for Toronto that locates financial institutions by census tract and links this information to census public use microdata from 1981 to 2006 to show that mainstream financial institutions have migrated to the suburbs and that, simultaneously, so-called fringe financial institutions, especially payday lenders, have expanded their operations in the inner city. The authors then use panel regression models and, among other results, find that census tracts with low income are less attractive to mainstream institutions over time and more attractive to fringe institutions, which provide more limited and expensive services. The results imply that the dynamics of the location of financial institutions may present an additional barrier to upward economic mobility for inner-city residents.","[Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Buckland, Jerry] Menno Simons Coll, Int Dev Studies, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Buckland, Jerry] Menno Simons Coll, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Simpson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",wayne.simpson@umanitoba.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,33,8,8,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Forecast support systems also offer the opportunity to address one of the weakest aspects of expert forecasting methods, the identification of experts. In the published literature, significant criticism is addressed to the subjectivity of expert identification methods, as different methods can lead, ceteris paribus, to significantly different results. This article introduces an approach to define objectively levels of expertise in large groups in a panel setting. This information is used to fine-tune panel members' contribution to the compound forecast in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the aggregated forecast. Tested on prospects collected from the UN World Tourism Organization Panel of Tourism Experts - probably world's most widely used and influential forecasts for the tourism sector - the proposed approach proves efficient in identifying experts in large groups of individuals. The results also indicate that the method is promising in leveraging their collective knowledge to return more accurate forecasts compared to simpler methods.","[Croce, Valeria; Woeber, Karl] MODUL Univ Vienna, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Kester, John] World Tourism Org UNWTO, Madrid, Spain",,"Croce, V (通讯作者)，MODUL Univ Vienna, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",valeria.croce@gmail.com,"Croce, Valeria/HMD-6376-2023; Kester, John/AAV-1648-2021",,,,,,52,3,3,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We find that firms typically had a large board and many directors held multiple directorships. Most boards included bank directors. While large, busy boards and bankers on the board were positively related to firm value before the crisis, their value significantly decreased from 1929 onwards, suggesting that these boards were less suited to face a crisis. Board busyness seems to be the main driver of negative board effects during the crisis. We also find that riskier firms which had busier and larger boards experienced a larger drop in value.

We begin by constructing an indicator system for comprehensive evaluation of the talent environment and then go on to classify our (country or region) target system using our proposed GA-DE-FCM methodology. We subsequently identify total 'human capital' as comprising of 'talent capital' and 'general labor', which, along with 'fixed assets', are used as the input variables of the economic system, whilst the corresponding gross domestic product is used as the output variable. The mapping between the inputs and output is modeled in this study by a 'fuzzy artificial neural network' from which several fuzzy rules can be extracted. Having extracted these fuzzy rules, we subsequently go on to investigate the effect of each input factor (fixed assets, talent capital and general labor) on the level of economic growth within each category (obtained in Step 1), and then carry out an examination of the ECRT within each category, as well as that within the whole target system. The traditional methods of evaluating ECRT are not regarded as satisfactory, given that the ECRT problem is non-linear and involves lags; however, we argue that based upon intelligent computing, the model proposed here can effectively deal with these issues. The results, based upon a 2001-2010 sample of 31 provinces in mainland China, indicate that during this period, China could be classified into three categories according to the talent environment. The first category (high level talent environment) comprises of just two regions, with an average ECRT of 44.61 per cent, whilst the second category (median level talent environment) comprises of five regions, with an average ECRT of 37.57 per cent, and the third category (low level talent environment) comprises of 24 regions, with an average ECRT of 14.8 per cent. The average ECRT for China as a whole is 25.67 per cent.","[He, Yong; Liao, Nuo] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Siwei] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Sch Business, Richmond, KY 40475 USA",Guangdong University of Technology; Eastern Kentucky University,"Liao, N (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",laura.first@163.com,,"He, Yong/0000-0001-7919-890X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301030, 71303061]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation at the Ministry of Education of China [11YJCZH057]; College Humanities and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province [12ZS0080]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Foundation at the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); College Humanities and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation for the support provided for this research by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers 71301030,71303061), the Humanities and Social Science Foundation at the Ministry of Education of China (Grant number 11YJCZH057) and the College Humanities and Social Science Project of Guangdong Province (Grant number 12ZS0080).",,25,9,12,4,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

With a tiny probability that any vote might be misrecorded, best responses involve voting by pairwise comparisons. Two candidates play a critical role: the weakest expected winner and the strongest expected loser. Expected winners are approved if and only if they are preferred to the strongest expected loser and expected losers are approved if and only if they are preferred to the weakest expected winner. At equilibrium, if any, a candidate is elected if and only if he is approved by at least half of the voters. With single-peaked preferences, an equilibrium always exists, in which the first candidates according to the majority tournament relation are elected.

This paper explores the impacts of information technology, urbanization on LTL freight flows by using a spatial autocorrelation model with freight flow data from a leading LTL company in China. The results show that all IT variables and urbanization variables have positive effects on freight flows. Distance, as expected, is negatively correlated with the freight flow volume. The application of the spatial autocorrelation model further shows that origin dependence, destination dependence and OD dependence are all significant, justifying the consideration of spatial interdependence. Finally, policy implications are discussed based on the estimated results. These findings shed light on the impacts of internet and urbanization on freight transportation, and contribute to the design of freight policies and the development of the LTL industry.

A methodological innovation of the generalized methods of moments is employed to assess the feasibility and timing of the revolution. The empirical evidence reveals that from a projection date of 2007, the Arab Spring was foreseeable between 2011 and 2012. The paper contributes at the same time to the empirics of predicting revolutions and the scarce literature on modeling the future of socioeconomic events. Caveats and cautions are discussed.","[Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, POB 8413, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nwachukwu, Jacinta C.] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Dept Accountancy, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",African Governance & Development Institute; University of Huddersfield,"Asongu, SA (通讯作者)，African Governance & Dev Inst, POB 8413, Yaounde, Cameroon.",asongusimplice@yahoo.com; j.c.nwachukwu@hud.ac.uk,"Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135",,,,,60,100,102,3,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

These indicators show that the 'European convergence machine' led to greater social cohesion between old and new Member States (EU-15 and NMS) until the onset of the crisis. In this article we offer an alternative perspective by directly comparing EU citizens' disposable household incomes. Using four waves of EU-SILC data, we explore what happened between 2005 and 2011 in the EU-15 and NMS regarding changes in the lowest household incomes in relation to the EU-wide median. Results show that, overall, the convergence machine seemed to work well for the lowest incomes in the NMS, but not so much for those living in the EU-15. At the same time, differences in living standards remain quite large. This points to important continued challenges for EU policy initiatives in the social domain.","[Goedeme, Tim; Collado, Diego] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Goedemé, T (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Tim.Goedeme@uantwerp.be,"Goedemé, Tim/S-5337-2019","Goedemé, Tim/0000-0002-2985-4320; Collado, Diego/0000-0001-5336-915X",Flemish Methusalem Programme; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [290613],Flemish Methusalem Programme; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"We would like to thank Frank Vandenbroucke, Bea Cantillon, Vincent Corluy, Istvan Toth, Karel Van den Bosch and four anonymous reviewers for comments and suggestions.

Spatial and Temporal Variation in the United States,REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PANEL-DATA; CONSUMPTION; TESTS; SIZE,"This study is the first to examine the relationship between conspicuous demand and housing price dynamics. We hypothesize that conspicuous consumers would want high-end homes to signal their wealth and this housing consumption behavior would induce greater deviations from fundamental house prices. We test this by using a unique dataset that matches the consumers' appetite for nonhousing luxury goods from Google Insights for Search to housing premiums that they pay for high-end houses in U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) during 2004-2011. The estimation results demonstrate that controlling for a wide range of MSA demographic and economic characteristics, conspicuous demand has a significant, positive relationship with housing premiums. This relationship varies spatially and temporally. Conspicuous demand has a stronger relationship with a price increase in high-end homes in MSAs with a steady, higher housing premium than in MSAs with a volatile, lower premium during the boom period. In MSAs with a steady, higher housing premium, the relationship remains significant even during the bust period, potentially contributing to maintaining higher housing premiums.","[Lee, Kwan Ok; Mori, Masaki] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Lee, Kwan Ok; Mori, Masaki] 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Lee, KO (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore.;Lee, KO (通讯作者)，4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstleeko@nus.edu.sg; rstmm@nus.edu.sg,"Mori, Masaki/GOK-0275-2022; Mori, Masaki/J-9362-2013; Lee, Kwan Ok/E-2731-2012","Mori, Masaki/0000-0003-3269-0715; Mori, Masaki/0000-0003-3269-0715; Lee, Kwan Ok/0000-0003-2545-2591",,,,,34,16,16,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2016,44.0,3,,,,,726,763,,10.1111/1540-6229.12115,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DR8FO,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380134000007,0

Using instrumental variables to control for endogeneity and estimating multiple specifications, we find that protein intake plays an important and positive role in height and weight growth in the 6-24 month period. Energy from other macronutrients, however, does not have a robust relation with these two anthropometric measures. Our estimates indicate that in contexts with substantial child undernutrition, increases in protein-rich food intake in the first 24 months can have important growth effects, which previous studies indicate are related significantly to a range of outcomes over the life cycle.

Multimodality refers to the use of more than one transport mode within a given period of time. While correlates of multimodality have been identified from cross-sectional data, there is very little known about the circumstances over time in which individuals become more or less multimodal. This paper is the first to fully adopt the mobility biography approach to study changes in multimodality over time at the individual level. Multimodality is measured using four continuous indicators of mode use in a seven-day period: the share in trips made by the most commonly used mode (primary mode), the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Shannon's entropy, and the number of modes used. The paper uses the German Mobility Panel (GMP) for the period 1994-2012. The results demonstrate that some of the life course events studied are significantly associated with changes in multimodality. Specifically, a child moving out of the household increases the multimodality of parents. Leaving the labour market increases multimodality, while entering the labour market conversely reduces multimodality. Changes in car access and driver licence holding have significant effects as well. An improvement to the public transport system in the neighbourhood increases multimodality, and vice versa. Reduced parking space availability also increases multimodality. The latter two findings endorse 'carrot and stick' transport policies as means of creating a more balanced use of transport modes.

We prove that the domestic tourists who live out of the town of the event and foreigners who came purposely for the event spend more in the enclosure. Comparing the expenditures in the city, foreigners spend more in town than the nationals who came from out of the city. Four distinct factors of satisfaction emerged in the application of the factorial analysis: organization of the festival, kind of music, conditions of the enclosure and accessibility to the venue. It was also found that the most satisfied with the event also have a higher propensity to spend more on the enclosure and in the city. This research reveals an important framework for event managers and for politicians. The results of this study will be important for the promotion and dissemination by the event organization to the extent that marketing campaigns should be directed to the identification of socio-demographic characteristics of the tourists, the factors of satisfaction and the lovers of the event that positively contribute to the expenditure in the city and in the enclosure. The results may be of interest to politicians, as the event, if properly assessed and planned, can be used as important marketing strategy in cities where it occurs. Moreover, this kind of event is already part of an itinerary tourism tour and for this reason, its social, cultural and economic importance will have to be properly assessed.","[Borges, Ana Pinto] ISAG European Business Sch, Campus Salazares Ramalde,Rua Salazares 842, P-4100442 Oporto, Portugal; [Borges, Ana Pinto; Rodrigues, Paula] Lusiada Univ North, Lisbon, Portugal; [Matias, Alvaro] Lusiada Univ, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Borges, AP (通讯作者)，ISAG European Business Sch, Campus Salazares Ramalde,Rua Salazares 842, P-4100442 Oporto, Portugal.",anaborges@isag.pt,"Borges, Ana/HOH-5629-2023; Pinto Borges, Ana/AAO-9585-2020; Pinto Borges, Ana/AIF-4271-2022; Rodrigues, Paula/W-4847-2017","Pinto Borges, Ana/0000-0002-4942-079X; Pinto Borges, Ana/0000-0002-4942-079X; Rodrigues, Paula/0000-0003-2967-2583",,,,,25,14,15,5,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

With this aim, an augmented gravity model is estimated for exports from the 79 ACP countries to the EU-15 for the time period of 19952013 using panel data techniques. The results are used to quantify the effect of the eligibility for EBA preferences on the export performance of the ACP least developed countries (LDCs) and to relate it to the impact of official development assistance on exports. In addition to their separate effects, the combined impact of EBA and aid flows is examined. The main results do not provide evidence for an additional positive effect of the EBA agreement on the export performance of the ACP LDCs. However, receiving aid shows a significant and positive effect on exports from EBA-eligible ACP countries to the EU-15, supporting an EU development strategy that includes both sorts of assistance, aid and trade preferences.","[Gradeva, Katerina] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I,"Gradeva, K (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness is grateful acknowledged (ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R).,,53,11,11,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2016,39.0,8,,,,,1146,1171,,10.1111/twec.12289,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DS7BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380938700005,0

Drawing on insights from Regulation theorists and Karl Polanyi, the article examines the market-making role of states during periods of transition from one growth regime to another. The more prominent role of the state follows from the stickiness of institutions and the role that states can play in compensating workers from the consequences of liberalization. The article illustrates the argument with an examination of France and Sweden in the period since the early 1980s. For all their differences, in both cases substantial liberalization of employment relations institutions took place and in both cases, but for the state, the process of liberalization would have been either stymied or much more uneven than it was.","[Howell, Chris] Oberlin Coll, Polit, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA",University System of Ohio; Oberlin College,"Howell, C (通讯作者)，Oberlin Coll, Dept Polit, Oberlin, OH 44047 USA.",chris.howell@oberlin.edu,,,,,,,75,38,42,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We can confirm the previous result and also find zero returns for other compliers in higher track schools. Moreover, we do not find a causal effect of schooling on cognitive skills. This is in line with a potential reason Pischke and von Wachter (2008) give for their result, namely that basic skills are learned earlier in Germany and additional years of schooling are no longer effective.

This article proposes a model-based latent class analysis of visitors' preferences and choices in order to identify different demand clusters in the Shiretoko Peninsula, Japan.

It consists of two parts. A dynamic demand estimator allows to obtain time-dependent pedestrian origin-destination demand within walking facilities. Using that demand, a traffic assignment model describes the propagation of pedestrians through the station, providing an estimate of prevalent traffic conditions in terms of flow, walking times, speed and density. The corresponding level-of-service of the facilities can be directly obtained. The framework is discussed at the example of Lausanne railway station. For this train station, a rich set of data sources including travel surveys, pedestrian counts and trajectories has been collected in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Railways. Results show a good performance of the framework. To underline its practical applicability, a six-step planning guideline is presented that can be used to design and optimize rail access facilities for new or existing train stations. In the long term, the framework may also be used for crowd management, involving real-time monitoring and control of pedestrian flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the period from the 1750s to the 1910s represented deskilling for the seamen working in sailing ships. The growth of international trade and shipping during the first era of globalization increased the overall demand for sailors but decreased the relative demand for skilled labor in favor of less skilled ones. This deskilling was associated with a decline in wage inequality, as the premium for high skilled seamen fell relative to mean wages in the shipping industry. The decline in skill premium may have facilitated the growth of trade and shipping, as the relative costs of transport declined. This in turn might have hastened the first era of globalization.

The Malmquist index approach was applied for the calculation of TFP growth using one output (annual production) and four inputs (land, seeds, nitrogen, and phosphate fertilizers) for the period 1980-2012. Variables used to identify the main determinants of the TFP growth include expenditures on agricultural research and extension, share of irrigated durum wheat area with respect to its total cultivated area, drought index, and infrastructure development in rural areas. Almon distributed lag model is used to assess the impact of the research expenditures variable. Empirical results show that TFP grew by 1.9% per year, on average, during the study period 1980-2012. This average growth rate was highly variable: 5.9% for the period 1980-1991; 2.2% for the period 1992-2002; and 2.07% for the period 2003-2012. TFP growth was mainly generated by technical change during the first period (1980-1991) and by technical efficiency change during the last period 2003-2012. Results also show that changes in the TFP growth have been mainly related to the R&D expenditure lags, and drought.","[Chebil, Ali] ICARDA, Tunis, Tunisia; [Frija, Aymen] ICARDA, Amman, Jordan; [Alyani, Rached] Ecole Super Agr ESA Mograne, Mograne, Tunisia",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Chebil, A (通讯作者)，ICARDA, Tunis, Tunisia.",chebila@yahoo.es,"; Frija, Aymen/D-8296-2016","Chebil, Ali/0000-0002-2931-4762; Frija, Aymen/0000-0001-8379-9054",Economic Research Forum (ERF),Economic Research Forum (ERF),The authors are most grateful to the Economic Research Forum (ERF) financial and intellectual support.

Our Monte Carlo experiments using a standard sticky-price DSGE model show that no significant bias is detected in parameter estimates and that the estimated impulse response functions are quite similar to the true ones. However, as the frequency of being at the ZLB or the duration of ZLB spells increases, the parameter bias becomes larger and therefore leads to substantial differences between the estimated and true impulse responses. It is also demonstrated that the model missing the ZLB causes biased estimates of structural shocks even with the virtually unbiased parameters.

Results highlight the significance of race in the relationship between first-time home buying and net worth during the decade. Although timing was critical to the short-term trajectory of net worth for whites, total net worth declines for black first-time homebuyers regardless of economic climate.

If researchers behave as predicted by economic theory, the research process can be modeled and simulated. The 'best' estimate is selected from regression experiments by a selection rule, SR, which gives the researcher's preferences for the fit (significance) and size of the estimated parameter. Eight s and five SRs are considered. To find a stable pattern for all 40 cases, 70 million regressions are simulated. The key results are: (1) All rational SRs cause the selected estimate to be substantially biased in the direction of the priors of the researcher. (2) All such rules give almost the same bias. It can be assessed from a set of estimates, and (3) the standard PET estimate of the meta-average reduces the bias by more than 90 %.","[Paldam, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Paldam, M (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",mpaldam@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,2,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Based on a panel of 25 Member States, we show that governments frequently fiscally stimulate the economy prior to elections. We argue that the occurrence of PBCs in the enlarged EU can be well explained by a peculiar interaction of two prominently discussed institutional constraints: fiscal institutions and media strength. Fiscal rules only help to limit the extent of PBCs in countries where the media is relatively weak, whereas they fail to do so in countries that host a strong press. Suggesting that this may be due to the usage of creative accounting practices in weaker media environments, we conclude that a powerful press remains key to eradicating PBCs in the EU.","[Ademmer, Esther] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Ademmer, Esther] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Dreher, Ferdinand] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; University of Groningen,"Ademmer, E (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",esther.ademmer@ifw-kiel.de,,,European Union [290647],European Union(European Union (EU)),"We thank Joscha Beckmann, Jakob de Haan, Christian Martin, Martin Plodt, Rainer Schweickert, Tobias Stohr, Bjorn van Roye, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this article.

Using Italian Labour Force quarterly data from 2006 to 2011 and a difference-in-differences approach, we show that the share of entrepreneurs in local labour, markets where industrial districts are present has declined more than in comparable areas after the beginning of the 2008 recession. The estimated negative differential effect ranges between 4.8 and 7.9% in absolute value. We examine alternative explanations - including differences in industrial specialisation and composition, access to credit propensity, exports, population density and the composition of talents - and conclude that our result is consistent with the intense social interactions typical of industrial districts, acting as a multiplier that amplifies the response to shocks.

We document a robust gradient between the early-life mortality environment to which men in India were locally exposed in their district and year of birth and the wages that they earn as adults. A 1 percentage point reduction in infant mortality (or 10 point reduction in IMR) in an infant's district and year of birth is associated with an approximately 2 percent increase in his subsequent adult wages. Consistent with theories and evidence in the literature, we find that the level of schooling chosen for a child does not mediate this association. Because of its consequences for subsequent wages, early-life health could also have considerable fiscal externalities; if so, public health investments could come at very low net present cost.

Furthermore, nonlinear models easily become very complex and difficult to estimate. The aim of this study is to investigate whether simple nonlinear extensions of autoregressive processes are able to provide more accurate forecasting results than linear models. Therefore, simple autoregressive processes are extended by means of nonlinear transformations (quadratic, cubic, sine, exponential functions) of lagged time series observations and autoregression residuals. The proposed forecasting models are applied to a large set of macroeconomic and financial time series for 10 European countries. Findings suggest that these models, including nonlinear transformation of lagged autoregression residuals, are able to provide better forecasting results than simple linear models. Thus, it may be possible to improve the forecasting accuracy of linear models by including nonlinear components. This is especially true for time series that are positively tested for nonlinear characteristics and longer forecast horizons.","[Rossen, Anja] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",,"Rossen, A (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",rossen@hwwi.org,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

San Cristobal de La Laguna is located in Tenerife, one of the seven islands in the archipelago of the Canary Islands, which is recognized as an outstanding mass tourist destination in the European Union. Tenerife is a world-known destination whose main product is based on sun and sand; however, other diversified products, like cultural visits to La Laguna, have been gaining more importance in recent decades. Analysing the complex linkages between transport and VEQ is paramount to city policy makers, as a good understanding of the performance for different dimensions of the product is crucial. Fuzzy logic has been demonstrated to be an effective way to deal with the subjective information provided by questionnaire responses addressing satisfaction and VEQ information. In this paper, the authors apply triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to a survey of tourists who visited La Laguna in 2010. The results show that VEQ is highly affected by the transport mode used in the visit and, therefore, city policymakers may extract important implications for future visitors.","[Carlos Martin, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, TIDES Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Rosa Marrero-Rodriguez, J.; Santana, Agustin] Univ La Laguna, Inst Polit & Social Sci, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Moreira, Pedro; Roman, Concepcion] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, TIDES, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Martin, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, TIDES Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jcarlos.martin@ulpgc.es; jrmarrod@ull.es; pedro.moreira.gregori@gmail.com; concepcion.roman@ulpgc.es; asantana@ull.es,"Moreira Gregori, Pedro Ernesto/AAK-6446-2020; Martin, Juan Carlos/F-6473-2014; Román, Concepción/I-5632-2018; Santana, Agustin/B-5314-2014","Moreira Gregori, Pedro Ernesto/0000-0003-1985-5394; Martin, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-2950-2405; Román, Concepción/0000-0002-0591-1298; Santana, Agustin/0000-0002-4046-0904; Marrero-Rodriguez, Josefa-Rosa/0000-0002-9542-4003",Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Spanish Government [ECO2011-23852],Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Spanish Government(Spanish Government),The authors wish to thank the Editor and the anonymous reviewers for their advice and comments which have contributed to the improvement of this paper.
