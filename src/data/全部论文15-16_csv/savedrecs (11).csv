In order to overcome a potential endogeneity issue between trade volume and the insurance, we employ the dynamic panel analysis technique in addition to a time series-cross sectional pooling model, fixed effect model, and random effect model. Focusing on the effect of the insurance variable, we control the other important variables to influence the trade volume including gross domestic production and geographical distance. As expected, the insurance is found to be an important variable to determine the volume of bilateral trade flow in most models while the distance is a negative determinant of trade volume, as the gravity model implies. The empirical results, showing an increase of trade volume following an additional one unit of the insurance, implies that Korean trade would grow faster if shifting to large and close economies, as the gravity model tells, while the insurance can play a pivotal role to support those transactions.","[Nam, Sang-wook] Seowon Univ, Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-boc] Natl Hlth Insurance Corp, Kolkata, India; [Choi, Seung-jae] \orea Informat Soc Dev, Gwacheon, South Korea; [Jung, Hong-joo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Seowon University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Jung, HJ (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",sangwooknam@hotmail.com; hyunboc@nhic.or.kr; sjaechoi@gmail.com; jungprokorea@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,1,1,4,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Using microdata from the Encuesta Nacional de Inmigrantes, we find that human capital of immigrants acquired in Spain presents higher returns than human capital obtained in home countries, reflecting the limited international transferability of the latter. This result is reinforced by the strong heterogeneity observed in wage returns to different kinds of human capital across immigrants from different origins and, in particular, by the fact that immigrants with the higher returns to human capital acquired in their home countries are those coming from other developed countries and Latin America, the two regions more similar to Spain in terms of development and/or culture.","[Sanroma, Esteban] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Ramos, Raul] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Simon, Hipolito] Univ Alicante, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresari, IEI, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Simon, Hipolito] Univ Alicante, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresari, IEB, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Sanromá, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, IEB, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",esanroma@ub.edu; rramos@ub.edu; hsimon@ua.es,"Ramos-Lobo, Raul/L-3287-2013; Sanroma, Esteban/P-6337-2014; Simon, Hipolito/K-8807-2014","Ramos-Lobo, Raul/0000-0003-0047-0793; Sanroma, Esteban/0000-0002-1965-6582; Simon, Hipolito/0000-0001-7668-307X",[ECO2013-41310-R]; [ECO2013-41022-R]; [CSO2011-29943-C03-02],; ;,"Esteban Sanroma (corresponding author): IEB, Universitat de Barcelona, Avda.

The results indicate the nonexistence of causal relationship between the CA and the KA. Furthermore, we examine the causal relations between the components of the KA and the CA along with exchange rate as the linking factor between them. The causal findings, in the above mentioned case, show different results. Our finding suggests that there exist a causal relationship from Nondebt flows to the CA via the real effective exchange rate. This implies that decomposition of the KA helps in identifying the source of flows that drives the CA the most. The results also indicate that volatile capital flows may deteriorate the CA balance and therefore, emphasis should be laid on improving the soundness of the financial sector before moving towards the full KA convertibility.","[Garg, Bhavesh; Prabheesh, K.

This expansion was aimed at facilitating women's labor force participation. Emphasis in quality services during the first years of life is essential. This document presents systematic information related to the design, management, financing and quality of childcare services in the region. These are the most important findings. First, evidence suggests that there are inconsistencies among the objectives of most of the programs - comprehensive child development- and the design of services that they offer. Second, programs ran by municipalities stand out as having better structural variables (usually associated with better quality of services) in comparison to those that depend on national governments, where investment rate per child served is lower. Third, there is variability in per-child costs of service, which is consistent with not only, a considerable heterogeneity in quality, but also with differences in cost-effectiveness across provision and management models. Offering quality childcare services to all children and guaranteeing that the public supply of these services reaches the poorest families are two important priorities that are still pending in the region's social policy agenda.",,,,mcaraujo@iadb.org; florencial@iadb.org,"; Lopez Boo, Florencia/B-7346-2018","Araujo, M.

Introducing such systems poses many challenges which are partly due to the high level of informality in the labor markets of these economies. This paper studies the consequences on the labor market of implementing an unemployment benefit system in economies with large informal sectors and high flows of workers between formality and informality. We build a search and matching model with endogenous destruction, on-the-job search, and intersectoral flows, where agents in the economy decide optimally whether or not to formalize jobs. We calibrate the model for Mexico, and show that the introduction of an unemployment benefit system, where workers contribute when employed in the formal market and collect benefits when they lose their jobs, even if they obtain informal jobs, can lead to an increase in formality in the economy, while also producing small increases in unemployment. The exact impact of incorporating such benefits depends on the relative strength of two opposing effects: the generosity of the benefits and the level of the contributions that finance those benefits. We also show important policy complementarities with other interventions in the labor market. In particular, combining the unemployment benefit program with policies that reduce the cost of formality, such as lower employment taxes and firing costs, can produce greater decreases in informality and lower impacts on unemployment than when the program is applied in isolation.

We use a suitable sequence of events in Swedish politics to provide the first answer to this question.

The Social Democrats won both elections and delivered on both promises. Using voting among parents with slightly older children as counterfactual, we find that voters with young children responded markedly to economic promises rather than to implemented policies.

The optimal degree of privatization depends crucially on the scale of network externality, the degree of compatibility (which, in the telecommunications industry, corresponds to the level of standardization that facilitates compatibility across different networks), and the cost type. A positive network externality will decrease the optimal degree of privatization, providing the rate of increase of marginal cost remains below a threshold. The impact of compatibility on optimal privatization is less straightforward. For instance, if the scale of network externality is low, a higher compatibility will increase optimal privatization if the rate of increase in marginal cost is also low. However, given a high network externality, optimal privatization initially increases, but then decreases as compatibility increases. Furthermore, optimal privatization with complete incompatibility may even be lower than that with complete compatibility.","[Wang, Chia-Chi] Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 10452, Taiwan; [Chiou, Jiunn-Rong] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan",Tatung University; National Central University,"Wang, CC (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, 40,Sec 3,Zhongshan N Rd, Taipei 10452, Taiwan.",jrchiou@livemail.tw,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

J,"Zhao, K",,,,"Zhao, Kai",,,The impact of the correlation between health expenditure and survival probability on the demand for insurance,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Annuities; Precautionary saving,TERM-CARE INSURANCE; UNCERTAIN LIFETIME,"This paper studies the effects of health shocks on the demand for health insurance and annuities, along with precautionary saving in a dynamic life-cycle model. I argue that when the health shock can simultaneously increase health expenses and reduce longevity, rational agents would neither fully insure their uncertain health expenses nor fully annuitize their wealth because the correlation between health expenses and longevity provides a self-insurance channel for both uncertainties. That is, when the agent is hit by a health shock (which simultaneously increases health expenses and reduces longevity), she can use the resources originally saved for consumption in the reduced period of life to pay for the increased health expenses. Since the two uncertainties partially offset each other, the precautionary saving generated in the model should be smaller than in a standard model without the correlation between health expenses and longevity. In a quantitative life-cycle model calibrated using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey dataset, I find that the health expenses are highly correlated with the survival probabilities, and this correlation significantly reduces the demand for actuarially fair health insurance, while its impact on the demand for annuities and precautionary saving is relatively small.

Therefore, for success of holding companies, selecting appropriate strategic alliance partner is a critical factor. Accordingly, the aim of the paper is to propose a systematic approach for an effective partner selection. Firstly, the underlying motivation and reasons for a strategic alliance building are presented using a SWOT analysis. Criteria of partners' evaluation are attained on the basis of combining strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Due to uncertainty of criteria, they are weighted using fuzzy quantitative strategic planning matrix (FQSPM). Because of a large number of criteria obtained from the SWOT-FQSPM analysis, criteria are diminished based on their weights using the Gap analysis with fuzzy data ranking. In the next step, it is proposed to apply four ranking algorithms including the Fuzzy Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS-F), the Fuzzy Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS-F), the Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis (Fuzzy MOORA), and the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to evaluate strategic partners. Finally, the results are combined with the help of the Borda method to choose the best alternative. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real partner selection problem at a holding industries factory in Iran is presented.","[Akhavan, Peyman] Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Barak, Sasan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Maghsoudlou, Hamidreza] Islamic Azad Univ, Qazvin Branch, Fac Ind & Mech Engn, Qazvin, Iran; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Malek Ashtar University of Technology; Technical University of Ostrava; Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Akhavan, P (通讯作者)，Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.",jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Akhavan, Peyman/AAE-9538-2022; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Akhavan, Peyman/AAJ-2253-2021; Akhavan, Peyman/ABD-1961-2022","Akhavan, Peyman/0000-0001-6256-3288; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Akhavan, Peyman/0000-0001-6256-3288; barak, sasan/0000-0001-7715-9958",Czech Science Foundation (GA CR) [14-31593S]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Czech Science Foundation (GA CR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GA CR Project No. 14-31593S) and the Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness - Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296,,37,50,50,5,65,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Following Ni and Wang (2007) we assume that a river is a segment divided into several regions from upstream to downstream. We show that when the transfer rate of the waste is unknown, the clean-up cost vector provides useful information for estimating some limits in regard to the responsibility of each region. We propose a cost allocation rule, the Upstream Responsibility rule, which takes into account these limits in distributing costs fairly and we provide an axiomatic characterization of this rule via certain properties based on basic ideas concerning the responsibility of regions.

A simple theoretical model predicts that the reform should cause couples to either get divorced or sign postnuptial agreements. Using a large panel of Danish register data, I find that the probability of getting divorced increased by between 0.1 and 0.3 % for couples that were affected by the reform, compared to couples that were not. Although these increases might appear small, given that the average divorce rates for the couples in the sample was less than 1 %, the relative increase in divorce probabilities caused by the reform was between 12 and 40 %. The effects are largest when the wife is the one gaining from getting divorced. Moreover, the reform influenced wives', but not husbands', pension savings and caused an increase in the number of postnuptial agreements.","[Amilon, Anna] SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Amilon, A (通讯作者)，SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ame@sfi.dk,,"Amilon, Anna/0000-0002-8433-5638",,,,,44,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using data from a large representative German household panel, we investigate to what extent personality traits, human capital, and the employment history influence the start-up decision and can explain the gender gap in entrepreneurship. Applying a decomposition analysis, we observe that the higher risk aversion among women explains a large share of the entrepreneurial gender gap. We also find an education effect contributing to the gender difference. In contrast, the Big Five model and the current employment state have effects in the opposite direction, meaning that the gender gap in entrepreneurial entry would be even larger if women had the same scores and the same employment status as men.

TARP was not a single approach to assisting weak banks but rather a variety of changing solutions to a set of evolving problems. TARP's passage was associated with significant improvements in financial markets and the health of financial intermediaries, as well as an increase in the supply of lending by recipients. However, a full evaluation must also take into account other factors, including the risks borne by taxpayers in the course of the bailouts; moral-hazard costs that could result in more risk-taking in the future; and social costs related to perceived unfairness. Our evaluation is organized in five parts: 1) What did policymakers do? 2) What are the proper objectives of interventions like TARP assistance to financial institutions? 3) Did TARP succeed in those economic objectives? 4) Were TARP funds allocated purely on an economic basis, or did political favoritism play a role? 5) Would alternative policies, either alongside or instead of TARP, and alternative design features of TARP, have worked better?","[Calomiris, Charles W.] Columbia Business Sch, Div Finance & Econ, Financial Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Khan, Urooj] Columbia Business Sch, Accounting Div, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Calomiris, CW (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, Div Finance & Econ, Financial Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cc374@columbia.edu; uk2117@columbia.edu,,"Khan, Urooj/0000-0002-1636-6846",,,,,73,46,48,0,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We focus on the spatial externalities of land use as drivers of spatial patterns: land is immobile by nature, but local actions affect the whole space since pollution flows across locations resulting in both local and global damages. We prove that the decision maker problem has a solution, and characterize the corresponding social optimum trajectories by means of the Pontryagin conditions. We also show that the existence and uniqueness of time-invariant solutions are not in general guaranteed. Finally, a global dynamic algorithm is proposed in order to illustrate the spatial-dynamic richness of the model. We find that our simple set-up already reproduces a great variety of spatial patterns related to the interaction between land use activities and the environment. In particular, abatement technology turns out to play a central role as pollution stabilizer, allowing the economy to reach a time-invariant equilibrium that can be spatially heterogeneous.

We ask two major questions. First, do panel income changes favor the income recipients who started at the top of the income distribution (divergent mobility) or those who started at the bottom (convergent mobility)? And second, are the groups that are found to gain the most when the economy is growing those that are found to lose the most when the economy is contracting (symmetry of mobility) or is the pattern asymmetric in the sense that the same groups do best both in times of economic growth and in times of economic decline? We find support for the divergent mobility hypothesis only in scattered years in the cases of Mexico and Venezuela and no support at all in the case of Argentina. Rather, earnings mobility is most frequently convergent or neutral in all three countries. As for the symmetry of mobility hypothesis, we find that it is rejected in nearly all cases; rather, those groups that gain the most when the economy is growing are also the ones that gain the most or lose the least when the economy is contracting. Furthermore, we discuss how the absence of divergence reconciles with rising inequality in the countries under study.","[Fields, Gary S.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Fields, Gary S.; Puerta, Maria Laura Sanchez] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Duval-Hernandez, Robert] Univ Cyprus, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Duval-Hernandez, Robert] CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Freije, Samuel; Puerta, Maria Laura Sanchez] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Cornell University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Cyprus; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

We consider two types of job creation subsidies: a subsidy for the cost of posting vacancies and a hiring subsidy. This paper finds that the effects of job creation subsides on unemployment differ between models with and without endogenous job separation. While a positive job creation subsidy shock lowers unemployment in a model without endogenous job separation, it increases unemployment in a model with endogenous job separation. We also find that while qualitatively the effects of a vacancy cost subsidy on the economy are similar to those of a hiring subsidy, quantitatively they are different. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Compared with face-to-face, telephone and mail surveys, web surveys may contain a different and new source of measurement error and bias: the type of device that respondents use to answer the survey questions. This is the first study that tests whether the use of mobile devices, tablets or smartphones, affects survey characteristics and stated preferences in a web-based choice experiment. The web survey on expanding renewable energy production in Germany was carried out with 3182 respondents, of which 12% used a mobile device. Propensity score matching is used to account for selection bias in the use of mobile devices for survey completion. We find that mobile device users spent more time than desktop/laptop users to answer the survey. Yet, desktop/laptop users and mobile device users do not differ in acquiescence tendency as an indicator of extreme response patterns. For mobile device users only, we find a negative correlation between screen size and interview length and a positive correlation between screen size and acquiescence tendency. In the choice experiment data, we do not find significant differences in the tendency to choose the status quo option and scale between both subsamples. However, some of the estimates of implicit prices differ, albeit not in a unidirectional fashion. Model results for mobile device users indicate a U-shaped relationship between error variance and screen size. Together, the results suggest that using mobile devices is not detrimental to survey quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of energy scarcity and environmental pollution, the industrial sector in China faces unsustainable growth problems. By adopting the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) framework, this paper analyzes the factor allocative efficiency of China's industrial sector, and estimates the energy savings potential from the perspective of allocative inefficiency. This paper focuses on three issues. The first is examining the factor allocative inefficiency of China's industrial sector. The second is measuring factor price distortion by the shadow price model. The third is estimating the energy savings potential in China's industrial sector during 2001-2009. Major conclusions are thus drawn. First, factor prices of capital, labor and energy are distorted in China due to government regulations. Moreover, energy price is relatively low compared to capital price, while is relatively high compared to labor price. Second, the industry-wide energy savings potential resulted from energy allocative inefficiency was about 9.71% during 2001-2009. The downward trend of energy savings potential implies the increasing energy allocative efficiency in China's industrial sector. Third, a transparent and reasonable pricing mechanism is conducive to improving energy allocative efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even in Norway, which is known for its successful economic and welfare development, lone mothers were at least three times more likely to be poor than married mothers. To redress this issue, the Norwegian government instituted a welfare reform in 1998, increasing lone-parent benefit levels and introducing working requirements. Using a quasi-experimental model, Mogstad and Pronzato (2008) found that the reform had a positive effect on lone mothers' labor supply and slightly reduced poverty. Yet given the extent of public resources invested, was this the most that policy makers could expect in terms of reducing poverty? To answer this question, I estimate a discrete choice model of work and welfare participation decisions, and use the behavioral estimates to derive the policy parameters that would have minimized poverty among lone mothers. To produce more robust results, a prerequisite for developing policy recommendations, the discrete choice model is validated by comparing its predictions with the estimated effects of the reform obtained from a quasi-experiment (Mogstad and Pronzato 2008).

Yet, intermittency is usually ignored in life-cycle cost calculations intended to assess the competitiveness of electric power from renewable as opposed to dispatchable energy sources, such as fossil fuels. This paper demonstrates that for intermittent renewable power sources a traditional life-cycle cost calculation should be appended by a correction factor which we term the Co-Variation coefficient It captures any synergies, or complementarities, between the time-varying patterns of electricity generation and pricing. We estimate the Co-Variation coefficient for specific settings in the western United States. Our estimates imply that the benchmark of cost competitiveness for solar photovoltaic (PV) power is 10 to 15% lower than previous average life-cycle cost analyses have suggested. In contrast, the generation pattern of wind power exhibits complementarities with electricity pricing schedules, yielding a cost assessment that is higher than that suggested by traditional calculations. For the specific settings we study, the corresponding magnitude of the markup is 10 to 15%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Second, the robustness and sensitivity of efficiency scores are tested based on a bootstrap approach. Third, the bootstrap results are employed to examine by how much different scenarios of improving technical efficiency scores can result in cost savings for individual banks. The results indicate a notable difference between the original and bootstrap efficiency estimates. While the conventional DEA results show that more than half of banks are fully technical efficient, the bootstrap results reveal a more accurate account of efficiency disparities from best-practicing banks.","[Moradi-Motlagh, Amir; Valadkhani, Abbas] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Saleh, Ali Salman] Notre Dame Univ, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon",Swinburne University of Technology; Notre Dame University Lebanon,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",abbas@swin.edu.au,"Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019","Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949",,,,,20,16,16,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper provides a new benchmark for its analysis in a tractable new open economy macroeconomic model, where the home-biased position is an optimal allocation. An equilibrium model of perfect risk-sharing is specified, with endogenous portfolios and firm entry.

In many of these markets there are also regulations that restrict entry, possibly distorting this process. We study the public interest rationale for entry taxes in a general equilibrium model with free entry and exit of firms in which firm dynamics are driven by reputation concerns. In our model firms can produce high-quality output by making a costly but efficient initial unobservable investment. If buyers never learn about this investment, an extreme lemons problem develops, no firm invests, and the market shuts down. Learning introduces reputation incentives such that a fraction of entrants do invest. We show that if the market operates with spot prices, entry taxes always enhance the role of reputation to induce investment, improving welfare despite the impact of these taxes on equilibrium prices and total production.

It argues that moral hazard does not necessarily decrease firms' profits in this setting. In highly competitive industries, firms are driven by business-stealing incentives and exert such high levels of R&D that they burn up their profits. In the presence of moral hazard, underprovision of R&D incentives due to risk sharing can generate considerable cost savings, implying higher profits for both rivals. This result indicates firms' incentives to adopt collusive-like behavior in the R&D market.

The partition brought about divergence in culture, institutions, and economic development. We use spatial regression discontinuity to examine, which empire effects are persistent. We find that differences in incomes, industrial production, education, corruption, and trust in government institutions disappeared with time as they were smoothed by economic forces and policy intervention. In contrast, differences in intensity of religious practices and in beliefs in democratic ideals, i.e., democratic capital, persist presumably via inter-generational within-family transmission. Differences in railroad infrastructure built by empires during industrialization persisted to this day. Cultural empire legacies have an effect on the political outcomes in contemporary Poland.

This paper analyzes tax competition between two countries over an infinite time horizon in an economy with trade costs and internationally mobile industrial firms. Most of the previous studies on tax competition in the 'new economic geography' framework employ static models. In this study, two governments dynamically compete with each other to attract firms through their choices of taxes and subsidies. It is shown that the commitment of the governments to their policies is crucial in determining the distribution of firms in the long run. Specifically, if governments find each others' tax policies credible, then one country will attract all the firms when trade costs are low enough to make agglomeration forces dominant. If policies are not credible, both countries may attract an equal share of firms even when trade costs are low, as the lack of commitment by governments acts as a dispersion force.

This paper proposes a unified basis for understanding these facts in a tractable dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, in which the key is the interaction of information flows and disaster risk. Information flows fluctuate between two regimes with different precision levels for signals regarding future economic fundamentals. A shift in forecast precision changes the probability of entering an economic disaster. High disaster risk leads to low expected capital returns and a decline in hours, investment, and output. Changing information structures results in different volatility and skewness over the business cycle. Simple theory makes the two expectation effects through information flows and disaster risk transparent. Quantitatively, the model suggests that the interaction of the two expectation effects plays a significant role in accounting for the higher-order moments of the business cycle.

In order to contribute to the current state of knowledge the analysis goes more into detail in terms of disaggregating the German GDP. Do Czech exports depend more on German domestic absorption, or is it, rather, German exports which determine Czech exports? Does the Czech Republic produce goods for German consumers or is it an outsourced supplier to German export channels, instead? Co-integration analysis and the analysis of the commodity structure of Czech exports to Germany are employed to address these questions. The findings of this research indicate that the relationship between Czech exports and German GDP is a very complex one. The Czech economy can be considered a part of German distribution channels, which serves as its specialized outsourced production capacity.","[Tauser, Josef] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Dept Int Trade, Prague, Czech Republic; [Arltova, Marketa] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Zambersky, Pavel] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fac Int Relat, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Tauser, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Dept Int Trade, Prague, Czech Republic.",tauser@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz; pavel.zambersky@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402112/G097],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This article was elaborated within the Research Plan MSMT MSM6138439909 Governance in Context of Globalised Economy and Society carried out at the Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics in Prague, Czech Republic and with the support of Grant Agency of the Czech Republic No. P402112/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics.",,47,29,29,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This specific application of IDA, which may be called temporal decomposition analysis, has been extended by researchers and analysts to study variations in energy consumption or energy efficiency between countries or regions, i.e. spatial decomposition analysis. In spatial decomposition analysis, the main objective is often to understand the relative contributions of overall activity level, activity structure, and energy intensity in explaining differences in total energy consumption between two countries or regions. We review the literature of spatial decomposition analysis, investigate the methodological issues, and propose a spatial decomposition analysis framework for multi-region comparisons. A key feature of the proposed framework is that it passes the circularity test and provides consistent results for multi-region comparisons. A case study in which 30 regions in China are compared and ranked based on their performance in energy consumption is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ang, B. W.; Xu, X.

The literature on the effect of finance on pollution is dominated by econometric studies of the effect of financial variables on the Environmental Kuznets Curve. The paper reviews this literature and finds that financial development in general, apart from financial crises, tends to reduce pollution. The paper will explain how financial crises affect the environment through reductions in effective demand, by forcing a switch to earlier technologies, and by encouraging the use of lower-cost, more polluting fuels. The paper explores the causative links between the nature of the recession and the reduction in long-term GDP growth via reductions in the share of investment in GDP. This is followed by an exploration of the necessity of investment and green banking in encouraging environmentally friendly development pathways. It will discuss the problems in modelling the effects of the financial system on the real economy, especially in respect of long-term growth and environmental pollution, with a focus on climate change and the mitigation of climate change.","[Anger, Annela] Univ East Anglia, Macroecon, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Anger, Annela] Univ East Anglia, MSc Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Barker, Terry] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res 4CMR, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of Cambridge,"Anger, A (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Macroecon, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",,,,,,,,108,12,12,0,10,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-44613-8; 978-1-137-44612-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,153,193,,,,,,41,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380488600005,0

In this article, we show that decision makers' social ties to external transaction partners can also hurt firm performance. Specifically, we use 34 years of data from the National Basketball Association and study the relationship between a team's winning percentage and its use of players that the manager acquired through social ties to former employers in the industry. We find that teams with tie-hired-players underper-form teams without tie-hired-players by 5 percent. This effect is large enough to change the composition of teams that qualify for the playoffs. Importantly, we show that adverse selection of managers and teams into the use of tie-hiring procedures cannot fully explain this finding. Additional evidence suggests instead that managers deliberately trade-off private, tie-related benefits against team performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To the extent that pathology services affect a patient's treatment pathway, significant healthcare costs are influenced directly by the performance of these services. Given pressures on the UK Department of Health to make efficiency savings and that little is known about the efficiency of pathology laboratories, this area offers unlocked potential for efficiency gains. We adopt a time varying inefficiency model, with laboratory-specific time paths for inefficiency, to identify potential savings in pathology services based on a panel of 57 English laboratories over a 5 year period. We apply a range of approaches to account for observable and unobservable heterogeneity between laboratories. We find potential efficiency savings of 13% in pathology services in this sample, which implies the potential for an annual saving of 390m pound in pathology across the NHS. Our study also provides valuable insights into the impact of a range of factors influencing laboratory costs.","[Buckell, J.; Longo, R.] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Smith, A.] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Smith, A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Holland, D.] Keele Univ, Keele Benchmarking Serv, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Keele University,"Buckell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England.",ts10jasb@leeds.ac.uk,"Longo, Roberta/ABB-5448-2020","Buckell, John/0000-0002-4157-4217",Innovation in Quantitative Methods scholarship by the University of Leeds,Innovation in Quantitative Methods scholarship by the University of Leeds,This work was funded under an Innovation in Quantitative Methods scholarship provided by the University of Leeds.,,94,4,5,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The real effects are computed as asymmetric impulse responses of output to inflation separately in the regimes with different signs of the differences between the expected inflation and the predicted output-neutral inflation. It is found that, with the increase in inflation, such effects increase in the regime with the positive sign, relatively to the effects in the regime with the negative sign. It is also shown that this finding is valid for most countries with high inflation episodes, where inflation is greater than 4.8% for at least 25% of quarterly observations. This leads to a simple policy prescription that, in economies with frequent high inflation episodes, anti-inflationary monetary decisions are least damaging for output if undertaken in the periods when the difference between the expected and output-neutral inflation is negative.","[Charemza, Wojciech] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Charemza, Wojciech] AFiBV, Warsaw, Poland; [Makarova, Svetlana] UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies, London WC1H 0BW, England; [Shah, Imran] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Leicester; University of London; University College London; University of Bath,"Shah, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",i.h.shah@bath.ac.uk,"Shah, Imran/W-6547-2019; Charemza, Wojciech/U-4463-2019","Shah, Imran/0000-0002-3662-4128; Charemza, Wojciech/0000-0002-4748-2655",ESRC/ORA project [RES-360-25-0003]; ESRC [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I009957/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC/ORA project; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Financial support of the ESRC/ORA project [RES-360-25-0003] Probabilistic Approach to Assessing Macroeconomic Uncertainties is gratefully acknowledged.,,47,3,3,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since its introduction, it has experienced a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth accompanied by huge volatility swings, and also attracted plenty of controversies which even involved law enforcement agencies. Hence, claims abound that bitcoin has been characterized by bubbles ready to burst any time (e.g. the recent collapse of bitcoin's biggest exchange, Mt Gox). This has earned plenty of coverage in the media but surprisingly not in the academic literature. We therefore fill this knowledge gap. We conduct an econometric investigation of the existence of bubbles in the bitcoin market based on a recently developed technique that is robust in detecting bubbles -that of Phillips et al. (2013a). Over the period 2010-2014, we detected a number of short-lived bubbles; most importantly, we found three huge bubbles in the latter part of the period 2011-2013 lasting from 66 to 106 days, with the last and biggest one being the one that 'broke the camel's back' - the demise of the Mt Gox exchange.","[Cheung, Adrian (Wai-Kong)] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Dept Finance & Banking, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Roca, Eduardo; Su, Jen-Je] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Curtin University; Griffith University,"Cheung, A (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Dept Finance & Banking, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",adrian.cheung@curtin.edu.au,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Cheung, Adrian (Waikong)/AAH-9468-2021","Cheung, Adrian (Waikong)/0000-0002-4369-2129",,,,,37,185,206,2,123,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contrast to liquid markets, the time it takes to sell a property can vary from a few days to a few months. In Slovenia a residential property's marketability depends strongly on the price dynamics of the market, housing characteristics and the degree of overpricing. The most important determinants of the marketing time are the cost and availability of housing finance as well as the housing price index, and all three can be directly related to the affordability of housing. We develop a two-stage model of the determinants of TOM and a duration model. The results of the list price model show that as the age of property increases, its (list) price decreases with diminishing pace, while the size of the property has the opposite dynamic. The presence and size of parking lots also has a positive effect on the (list) price. The results of the Time on the Market model show that property characteristics, market conditions and macroeconomic determinants are all statistically significant determinants of TOM. The degree of overpricing turned out to be a statistically significant determinant of time on the market. However, this effect does not seem to be statistically significantly non-linear (U-shaped). Higher house prices (at the national level) and the average interest rate on housing loans both extend a property's time on the market while better availability of housing loans, in contrast, shortens the TOM. We additionally estimated a proportional hazard model of the TOM that yielded consistent results.","[Cirman, Andreja; Pahor, Marko; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Cirman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",andreja.cirman@ef.uni-ll.si; marko.pahor@ef.uni-lj.si; miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,37,14,15,1,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Changing demographics and increasing average age of employees highlight organizational threats such as unique knowledge loss and lack of qualified personnel. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine age management practices at the organization level, which could help to reduce the challenges of workforce demographic aging. The present article presents a theoretical study, which helps to identify the most frequently mentioned age management areas and their features outlined in the scientific literature. Authors used scientific literature analysis, data structuring, and evaluation methods. The theoretical research highlights that the key age management areas are as follows: job recruitment, learning and knowledge management, changing attitudes, flexible working practices, health management, workplace environment and ergonomics. It has been revealed that each of these age-management areas are closely related to each other. For example, older workers' training is closely related to the treatment of employees in this age group. In practice, it is very often assumed that older workers are unable or unwilling to learn; therefore, they are not included in the training programs. In this context, changing attitudes towards older workers is a crucial element.","[Ciutiene, Ruta; Railaite, Rasa] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciutiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ruta.ciutiene@ktu.lt; r.railaite@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,15,21,4,52,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is argued that uncertainty is interdependent with the evolution of institutions and behaviour, including that designed to help society cope with uncertainty. Whilst some mainstream theory does address uncertainty, it employs a much narrower concept than fundamental uncertainty. Generally, in spite of the evident increase in fundamental uncertainty during the crisis, most mainstream theory ignores it. Although ignoring uncertainty can sometimes be a successful coping mechanism, it is argued that, as a blanket coping mechanism, ignoring uncertainty seriously limits the realism of theory and therefore also practice and policy. It is concluded that economists should embrace uncertainty by tailoring methodologies and theories to address it. This would provide a more fruitful basis for policy aimed at reducing uncertainty in the economy and also reducing our own uncertainty.","[Dow, Sheila C.] Univ Sterling, Stirling, Scotland; [Dow, Sheila C.] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Stirling; University of Victoria,"Dow, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,21,22,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Social media has become a mainstream, modified personal relationships, allowed individuals to contribute to number of issues and generated new possibilities and challenges to facilitate collaboration. Organizations have urgent need of not only focusing on innovation of new products and services, but also paying specific attention to effective knowledge sharing, which is of vital importance for their success. The potential advantage of embracing and implementing social media is enormous. Although the interest in social media is increasing, on the one hand knowledge workers and managers are waiting to get involved in this collaborative world, because they may not feel motivated or may not be aware of the advantages of using these tools for work purposes. On the other hand, organizations do not tend to allow their employees to use social media technologies because they may be concerned about the risks and consequences of a potential misuse. Our exploratory survey investigates how internal or external (available through official internal network) social media technologies are being used for knowledge sharing during work or for professional development. The study was accomplished with the help of enterprises and institutions operating in Hungary from profit and non-profit sectors, applying quantitative research methods. In total 299 individuals (white-collar workers, middle level managers, top management) participated by completing the online, web-based questionnaire. The results have shown that Hungarian organizations prefer not to allow the usage of external social media; but where the employees are supported to reach these tools, high proportion of the people utilize them. The paper provides recommendations to the organizations how to foster motivating employees for using social media technologies for work purposes in knowledge sharing.

Our analysis provides strong evidence of the presence of a common stochastic trend driving the observed series forming the panel of CPI-based inflation rates for the regions. This, coupled with the presence of a jointly stationary idiosyncratic component, implies the existence of pairwise cointegration across the regional CPI-based inflation rates, which show a clear pattern of convergence over time. This gives an indication of increased geographical homogeneity in consumption patterns. The evidence for the panels of CPI-based inflation of groups of goods and services and PPI-based inflation of industrial sectors indicates the existence of four independent common stochastic trends. This, combined with jointly stationary idiosyncratic series, provides much weaker evidence of cross-cointegration for these two panels.","[Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro C.; Romero-Avila, Diego; Usabiaga, Carlos] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Usabiaga, C (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain.",cusaiba@upo.es,"Usabiaga, Carlos/AAI-8911-2020; Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017; Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/ABT-6325-2022","Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/0000-0003-1060-0256; Usabiaga, Carlos/0000-0002-1519-9070",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-13357]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35430]; Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science [SEJ-4546],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science,This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [grant number ECO2009-13357]; the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [grant number ECO2012-35430]; and the Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science under Excellence Project SEJ-4546.,,52,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The liquidity efficiency of the firms is higher than the sales efficiency but the results indicate that there are not statistical significant differences in the rankings estimated by the two models in each period. The Malmquist Productivity Index reveals that over the period of the study, firms have experienced an annual average increase in productivity of 0.5% (a slight progress). On examining the components of this productivity change, it becomes evident that firms have experienced an annual average of 2% increase in technology combined with a decrease in technical efficiency of -1.5%. The results indicate that 52.4% of the firms experienced productivity gains in the examined period, and this was mainly the result of technological gain rather than efficiency improvement. More than 90% of the firms in the sample shift the efficiency frontier and only 33.3% of the firms are catching up, improving their productivity by reducing inefficiency. Moreover, the empirical study reveals that the overall technical inefficiencies of the firms are primarily caused by pure technical inefficiencies rather than scale inefficiencies.","[Giokas, Dimitrios; Eriotis, Nicolaos; Dokas, Ioannis] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10569, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Dokas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10569, Greece.",idokas@econ.uoa.gr,"GIOKAS, DIMITRIS/AAL-6627-2021",,,,,,73,20,20,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Perhaps this article is the most comprehensive study that investigates the relationship between interest rate uncertainty and banking sector development for a large group of emerging economies. To do this, the short-run and long-run models using a bounds testing approach to cointegration for 12 emerging economies over the period 1980-2011 have been developed. Estimated results from all models indicate that interest rate uncertainty has significant effect on banking sector development in both short-run and long-run phenomena in the majority of countries.

Such effects, as suggested by the prospect theory, are confirmed in many empirical studies showing that consumers' perceptions are substantially influenced by prices of frequent purchases and that price increases are perceived more strongly than price reductions. Following those observations, alternative consumer price indices were proposed, such as the out-of-pocket price index (ECB 2003) or the index of perceived inflation (Brachinger 2006, 2008). They proved particularly useful in interpreting a jump of inflation perception in some of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) economies after the euro introduction. The role of price changes of frequently bought goods and services in determining consumer opinions on price changes also seems significant in Poland, as revealed especially after its accession to the European Union (EU) in 2004. To assess whether their impact on subjectively perceived price changes is of a systematic nature, in this paper we develop different types of indices of price changes that are likely to influence consumer opinions on observed price developments. Then we evaluate them in terms of their impact on consumer inflation perception, as proxied with survey data, and define on this basis the best-performing index, called the consumer perceived price index (CPPI). The results suggest that Polish consumers observe a relatively wide range of goods and services and that both factors suggested by the prospect theory seem to influence their opinions on the evolution of prices in the past.","[Halka, Aleksandra] Natl Bank Poland, Inst Econ, Bur Inflat Anal, Warsaw, Poland; [Lyziak, Tomasz] Natl Bank Poland, Econ Res Bur, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Lyziak, T (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",Tomasz.Lyziak@nbp.pl,,"Lyziak, Tomasz/0000-0002-0488-4259",,,,,19,3,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The rotated factor analysis technique is used to construct the last three dimensions. The Weibull parametric survival model has been specified and estimated using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data of 2011. The results show that three measures of empowerment (the level of education, participation in HH decisions and autonomy in movements) contribute significantly to the reduction of infant mortality.

Most previous studies have used a least squares (LS) method or variation, which focuses on the issue only at the mean of the growth rate. Therefore, such results cannot provide a satisfactory answer to what can happen if the growth rate is far from the conditional mean level. For example, we consider the following question: do we still have economic growth convergence or is the convergence speed changed in a low growth period such as the Great Recession,' that started in 2008? We propose using instrumental variable panel quantile regression to answer this question. Our empirical findings demonstrate that economic growth convergence occurs at all quantiles over the entire conditional distribution, but that the convergence speed does depend on quantiles; the convergence speed is much higher when the GDP growth rate is at either high or low quantiles.","[Huo, Lijuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Kim, Tae-Hwan] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Yunmi] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Beijing Institute of Technology; Yonsei University; Yonsei University,"Kim, TH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",tae-hwan.kim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our attempt is to first start with the original Mises's argument against socialism and then to capture Hayek's perception or perhaps even his misperception of it. In particular we plan to show that the term knowledge can be used to depict noticeable dissimilar meanings. Such an aspect can be seen when one compares Hayek's initial works about knowledge with his late answer to Lange's model of market socialism.

The effective incorporation of networking in the strategies of HEIs is one of the core issues in the development of current HEIs. This incorporation raises two major issues: the lack of tools to monitor the progress of networking and the lack of ability to generate needed and network-related insights for strategy. The aim of this article is to suggest a networking assessment tool and to apply it empirically. This tool consists of multi-criteria evaluation and evaluation with network pictures. It adapts simple additive weighting (SAW) - data normalisation and Social Network Analysis methods (SNA).

The amount of trade affected by Russia's counter-sanctions varies across the Baltic states. In 2013, the exports of goods affected amounted to 2.6% of GDP in Lithuania, 0.4% of GDP in Estonia, and 0.3% of GDP in Latvia, but re-exports are included in these numbers.

However, issues of omitted variables bias have plagued many due to a reliance on nonparametric techniques or basic regression models. This article examines across-game and within-game momentum in the English Premier League (EPL) football competition using fixed effects regressions to control for time-invariant heterogeneity in conjunction with traditional nonparametric techniques. Although the results show evidence of performance reversal following winning streaks, no such evidence is found for streaks of draws or losses or in goal-scoring performance within games. This suggests that momentum is better suited as a post hoc label of performance than a robust causal phenomenon.","[Parsons, Stephanie; Rohde, Nicholas] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Rohde, N (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",n.rohde@griffith.edu.au,,"Rohde, Nicholas/0000-0002-4606-2624",,,,,50,10,11,6,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, these expectations are generally unobservable and only certain proxy variables exist, such as surveys on inflation expectations. This article offers guidance on the appropriate quantification of household inflation expectations in the Swiss Consumer Survey, where answers are qualitative in nature. We apply and evaluate different variants of the probability approach and the regression approach; we demonstrate that models that include answers on perceived inflation and allow for time-varying response thresholds yield the best results; and we show why the originally proposed approach of Fluri and Sporndli (1987) has resulted in heavily biased inflation expectations since the mid-1990s. Furthermore, we discuss some of the key features of Swiss household inflation expectations, i.e. the fact that there has been a shift in expectation formation since 2000 (expectations are better anchored and less adaptive, and there is lower disagreement of expectations). We suggest that this may be linked to the Swiss National Bank's adjustment of its monetary policy framework around this time. In addition, we outline how expectation formation in Switzerland is in line with the sticky information model, where information disseminates slowly from professional forecasters to households.","[Rosenblatt-Wisch, Rina; Scheufele, Rolf] Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Rosenblatt-Wisch, R (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Borsenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",rina.rosenblatt@snb.ch; rolf.scheufele@snb.ch,,,,,,,36,4,4,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a newly created dataset, we find that during the Socialist central-planning period, economic growth in both countries was largely driven by physical capital accumulation. This finding follows logically from the development policies in place at that time. During their transition periods, (i.e., starting from the late 1970s in China and the late 1980s in the FSU), China managed to keep technical inefficiency of production factors in check, largely by massively increasing its human capital, thereby lowering the physical-to-human capital ratio. In contrast, the FSU accomplished a similar outcome largely through reducing its stock of physical capital. As a result, although there was little difference in technical efficiency between these two economies, China's emphasis on human capital formation made it easier for this country to improve its general productivity and to increase per capita growth. This changed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the FSU began to recover economically, regaining its 1990 levels of output and productivity.","[van Leeuwen, Bas; Foldvari, Peter] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Leeuwen, Bas] Int Inst Social Hist, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Didenko, Dmitry] Bank Dev & Foreign Econ Affairs Vnesheconombank, Moscow, Russia; [Didenko, Dmitry] Inst Sociol RAS, Moscow, Russia",Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; International Institute of Social History (IISH-KNAW); Russian Academy of Sciences; Federal Center of Theoretical & Applied Sociology - FCTAS; Institute of Sociology of the RAS,"van Leeuwen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",bas.vanleeuwen1@googlemail.com; didenko_d_v@veb.ru; p.foldvari1@uu.nl,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021; Didenko, Dmitry V./F-7793-2017","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; Didenko, Dmitry V./0000-0001-5295-2538; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,75,5,5,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In a regionally decentralized authoritarian regime, a government marked by political centralization and fiscal decentralization, intergovernmental transfers are employed by politicians as instruments to achieve political goals. Using China's provincial data from 1994 to 2009, we find that the officials' political power is an important factor in the distribution process. A party secretary's replacement facilitates an increase in transfers, especially if the replacement comes from the central government. If a party secretary is a member of the Central Politburo, the province receives more conditional transfers than others. The central government allocates the transfers in such a way that the province with a high proportion of the minority population receives more transfers than others.","[Wan, Xin; Zhang, Kezhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yuanyuan] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Irish Longitudinal Study Aging TILDA, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Ma, Yuanyuan] Inst Study Labor IZA, Dublin, Ireland",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Trinity College Dublin,"Zhang, KZ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",zkzdr@hust.edu.cn,"Ma, Yuanyuan/HSH-7412-2023","Ma, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-1090-4551",,,,,47,13,14,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Viewing tax morale as a measure of the symmetry between the codified laws and regulations of formal institutions (state morality) and the unwritten socially shared rules of informal institutions (civic morality), the proposition is that the lower the tax morale (i. e. the greater the asymmetry between state morality and civic morality), the greater is the likelihood to participate in the shadow economy. To evaluate this, a 2013 survey is reported involving 3036 face-to-face interviews in these 3 Baltic nations. Using logistic regression analysis, the finding is that the likelihood of participating in the shadow economy is greater, the lower is the tax morality of individuals, population groups and countries. In addition, the likelihood to participate is shadow economy is found to significantly vary by, for example, gender, employment status and country, people living in Latvia and Lithuania displaying significantly lower likelihood to engage in the shadow economy. The paper then explores the implications for theorizing and tackling the shadow economy.","[Williams, Colin C.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Horodnic, Ioana A.] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",University of Sheffield; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Williams, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",c.c.williams@sheffield.ac.uk,"Williams, Colin C/B-1198-2016; Horodnic, Ioana Alexandra/Y-7733-2019","Williams, Colin C/0000-0002-3610-1933; Horodnic, Ioana Alexandra/0000-0002-4948-8989",Research Executive Agency of the European Commission [611259],Research Executive Agency of the European Commission,This work was supported by the Research Executive Agency of the European Commission [grant number 611259].,,94,28,31,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Searches seem more valuable for products of high quality, but buyers may have little incentive to search since such products are less frequently purchased. The extent of price dispersion is examined using a sample of around 160 000 diamonds offered for sale online. Estimates from a two-stage econometric strategy show that price dispersion increases significantly with quality. An explanation is that buyers of high-quality gemstones pay little attention to the price of these diamonds and even more so if they perceive high prices as signals of quality and rarity of the diamonds they intend to purchase.","[Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Paris, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] INED, Paris, France",Nantes Universite,"Wolff, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Paris, France.",francois.wolff@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,24,9,9,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Linearity of best responses in others' contributions is key to matching the two frameworks. We identify all utility functions that display this linearity, and we provide conditions ensuring that the minimal properties that Bergstrom et al. require for utilities are satisfied. Using techniques developed in the threshold uncertainty framework, we show existence and uniqueness of the Bayes-Nash equilibrium-thus generalizing existing results- and we analyze its comparative statics properties. In particular, under the reasonable assumption that agents' income is stochastic and private information, we complement the full-information crowding-out and redistribution results of Bergstrom et al. If the government taxes agents' income proportionally and redistributes (expected) revenues lump sum, equilibrium public good provision can increase or decrease, even if the set of contributors is unchanged. Similarly, we show that crowding-out can be one-for-one, less than one-for-one, or more than one-for-one. Finally, we extend our results to a multidimensional framework in which agents' unit costs of contributions are also private information.","[Barbieri, Stefano] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 206 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Malueg, David A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, 3136 Sproul Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Tulane University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Barbieri, S (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 206 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",sbarbier@tulane.edu; david.malueg@ucr.edu,,,,,,,37,7,7,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Firm-level efficiency growth decreases with firm age, whereas reallocation towards efficient firms contributes more to industry-level growth as firms mature. The relative contribution of start-ups appears to have been important as they actually contributed positively to overall efficiency growth which, over the period under consideration, was negative in most countries, even before the Great Recession'.

Empirical evidence for basmati and non-basmati rice,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,International trade; pricing to market; India; basmati and non-basmati rice,RATE PASS-THROUGH; UNITED-STATES; MARKET POWER; TO-MARKET,"The role of exchange rate fluctuations on the pricing behaviour of Indian rice exporters in their major destination markets is examined using the pricing-to-market (PTM) model. The analysis was undertaken in a context where India has emerged as a leading exporter of rice in the world market. The study distinguishes between basmati and non-basmati rice in the analysis as the destination markets differ across these two varieties. One of the key contributions of this study is that it undertakes an analysis under 3 exchange rate models, they are: nominal, real and commodity-specific exchange rates. The results from our analysis indicated the presence of non-competitive pricing behaviour of India's rice exporters in majority of destination markets due to both the market-specific characteristics as well as exchange rate-induced effects. The amplification of exchange rate effects was more prominent in commodity-specific exchange rate model whereas local currency stabilization was more prominent under nominal and real exchange rate models. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the commodity-specific exchange rate better predicts the PTM behaviour of rice exporters.","[Issar, Akash] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Varma, Poornima] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Management Agr, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Varma, P (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Management Agr, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",poornimav@iima.ac.in,,"Issar, Akash/0000-0002-6349-2896",,,,,28,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This circumstance leads to odd across-trait bilateral trade amounts and surpluses favorable towards Taiwan. The purposes of this paper are applying Johnson and Noguera (2012) to extricate value-added exports earned by Taiwan from China and Wang, Wei, and Zhu (2013) to decompose Taiwan's gross exports to China into various meaningful components. The two issues are related to trade in value added and value added in trade. Specifically, the former explores the value added embedded in the source country's exports to the absorbing country as final demand, regardless of whether those goods are directly or indirectly arriving at the absorbing country. The latter only looks where the value added is originated regardless of where it is ultimately absorbed. We show both concepts aim to measure a country's value added from its trades, but from different angles. Each has its own distinct meaning. They are related, but not completely the same. The inter-country input-output (ICIO) table used in this paper comes from the World Input Output Database (WIOD) (Timmer et al., 2015 and Dietzenbacher et al., 2013). Empirical results indicate that Taiwan's export values to Mainland China shrink by 64.3% when bilateral trades are measured in value-added terms. Furthermore, Taiwan's trade surplus toward China also decreases by 65.2% under this measure. From the viewpoint of value added in trade, the share of value added in Taiwan's gross exports to China continued to decrease and reached 50.9% in 2011, while the components of foreign value added and double counted terms kept growing in recent years.

We estimate the shares of the super-rich in Chile showing that accrued capital gains have a large impact on these estimates.

An empirical analysis, based on a sample of 2,356 individuals, indicates a positive propensity to allocate more money on ecotourism. Although overall subjective norms and environmental beliefs play a positive role in the WTP_PP for ecotourism, the attitude to admire wealthy people reduces the propensity to pay a premium price. Furthermore, a regression tree is carried out to highlight the main items that contribute to the WTP_PP. The results show that those who have a high awareness for ecotourism would financially support ecotourism projects in the visited destination and are willing to pay more today for a better experience in the future.

The ARDL Bounds testing procedure (Pesaran et al., 1999; 2001) has several econometric advantages compardd with the standard Johansen and Juselius cointegration method. One distinguishing feature of this ARDL Bounds testing procedure is its ability to estimate the long-run economic relationship without requiring pre-testing the time-series for the presence of unit roots in the data generating process incorporated in the cointegration model. The empirical findings in this study indicate that per capita real income (INCOME), the population percent above 65 years (AGE) and the level of health care technology (HRD), measured as the level of Research & Development expenditure in health care are cointegrated. INCOME, AGE and HRD exert positive effects on U.S. health expenditure per capita. Unlike prior studies, this paper presents new empirical evidence indicating that the U.S. health care is a necessity, with an income elasticity estimate of around 0.92. We also find that medical technology advances play a major role in the long run rise of the U.S. health expenditure, We discuss implications of these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper contributes to this debate by showing two results. First, it is shown that for a certain class of optimal control problems, the derivative of the value function with respect to the initial state may approach infinity as the state variable goes to zero, even when the first-order partial derivatives of the integrand and transition functions are finite. In the process, it is shown that standard phase diagrams used in optimal control theory contain more information than generally recognized and that the value function itself may be easily illustrated in these diagrams. Second, we show that even if the value function has an infinite derivative at some point, it is not correct to avoid this point in finite time at almost any cost. The results are illustrated in a simple linear-quadratic fisheries model and proven for a more general class of growth functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The most common explanation is that people make a rational choice between the utility they expect from the benefit and the effort required to take-up. Most studies utilize surveys, which are subject to misreporting and measurement errors, to determine eligibility and non-take-up rates. This study uses a novel dataset based on administrative data sources, which provides a more accurate identification of eligible households and take-up. Furthermore, this study documents non-take-up of a compensation to which nearly 5 million Dutch households are entitled. The richness of the data allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of key drivers of non-take-up. The analysis largely confirms the transaction-costs hypotheses. However, we found an unexpected effect.

Equilibrium entails price dispersion, where sellers compete for buyers by posting prices. We identify three channels through which inflation affects welfare. The real balance channel is the source of welfare loss. Its interaction with the price posting channel generates a welfare cost larger than Lucas (2000). The search channel reduces the welfare cost by more than one half through general equilibrium effect. The aggregate effect of these three channels on welfare is non-monotonic. Additionally, the welfare cost of inflation fluctuations is negligible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Wu, JH",,,,"Wu, Jianhong",,,Robust random effects tests for two-way error component models with panel data,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hypothesis test; Individual effect; Panel data model; Time effect,,"In this paper, two test statistics are constructed respectively for individual and time effects in linear panel data models by comparing estimators of the variance of the idiosyncratic error at different robust levels. The resultant tests are one-sided, and asymptotically normally distributed under the null hypothesis. Power study shows that the tests can detect local alternatives that differ from the null hypothesis at the parametric rate. Due to the first difference and orthogonal transformations used in the construction of variance estimators of the idiosyncratic error, the two proposed tests are robust to the presence of one effect and the possible correlation between the covariates and the error components when the other one is tested. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to provide evidence on the finite sample properties of the tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find empirical evidence that the financial crisis was accompanied by an increase in volatility persistence and that this effect was particularly pronounced for those stocks that were subject to short selling constraints.

In a lab and an internet experiment, subjects in the role of employers can condition their wages on the employees' home provinces. The resulting systematic differences in wages can be linked to natural groups and economic characteristics of the provinces. In-group favoritism increases wages for employees who share the same origin as the employer, while an increased probability of being matched with an employee with a different ethnicity reduces wages. Furthermore, wages in the laboratory increase with the actual wage level in the employees' home province. Nevertheless, employees' effort is not influenced by these variables; only the wage paid in the experiment influences effort. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We prove this result within a static oligopolistic game in which both supply function competition and Cournot competition yield a unique Nash equilibrium, whereas price setting yields a continuum of Nash equilibria. There are parameter regions in which Bertrand profits are higher than Cournot ones, with the latter being higher than in the supply function equilibrium. Such permutation of the typical ranking occurs when price-setting mimics collusion. We then show that the modification in the ranking of profits is responsible for a permutation in the welfare performance of the industry, for any structure of the latter. Regulation may then be needed even under price competition and free entry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In a stylized Cournot model of interacting spot and forward electricity markets, I analyze how different price-based support schemes affect producer strategies and, ultimately, competition in the wholesale market. I compare the strategic behavior of renewable and conventional producers in terms of electricity production and forward market sales in the presence of two different price-based support schemes: feed-in tariffs and feed-in premiums. I show that the feed in premium, which is the European Commission's current scheme of choice, may enhance market power and favor conventional electricity production. it may also reduce the likelihood of achieving the political objective to increase production from renewable energy sources.

We specify a multistage model of human-capital accumulation with a finite number of types representing unobserved individual characteristics. Class-size and latent student-performance indices are assumed to follow finite mixtures of normal distributions. Grade retention may increase or decrease the student's knowledge capital in a type-dependent way. Our estimation results show that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of grade retention on test scores is positive but small at the end of grade 9. Treatment effects are heterogeneous: we find that the ATT of grade retention is higher for the weakest students. We also showthat class size is endogenous and tends to increase with unobserved student ability. The average treatment effect of grade retention is negative, again with the exception of the weakest group of students.

This research examines the interaction between a set of woody biomass harvesting sources (logging residue, non-merchantable, and merchantable roundwood) and wood types (hardwood, planted softwood, and natural softwood), and the impacts harvest costs have on the extraction of these materials in the southern US. The expected woody biomass availability and its geographic distribution are determined with a cost minimizing linear programming model. The marginal cost of woody biomass supply is determined for different energy production targets, subject to satisfying conventional wood demand. Given derived industry supply curves, the economic impacts of the sector are analyzed using the IMpact analysis for PLANning model (IMPLAN) at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) level. The results suggest that forest biomass for energy production is projected to be available over a much wider price range with logging, residue, and non-merchantable and merchantable roundwood in these regions. Supply of hardwood and softwood biomass from merchantable roundwood is expected to increase if these materials can be harvested for non-conventional uses. Development of harvesting woody biomass from logging residue, non-merchantable, and merchantable timber has positive effects on local economies, bringing with it employment opportunities to some BEA regions.

This paper investigates the response of U.S. export prices to changes in foreign tariffs at the firm level, accounting for firm productivity and endogenous product quality. In our model, exporting firms respond to foreign tariff reductions by upgrading product quality and increasing prices, resulting in incomplete tariff pass-through and in some cases a quasi-Metzler paradox (quality-unadjusted, tariff-inclusive prices increase). The upgrading response is greater for high productivity firms; however, the greater a product's scope for quality differentiation, the greater is the tendency for high productivity firms to have higher initial prices due to higher initial quality, resulting in a smaller tariff absorption elasticity (log increase in the tariff-exclusive price). Using U.S. transaction-level export data, plant-level manufacturing data, and multiple measures of scope for quality differentiation, we confirm several predictions of the theory, including an average firm-level quasi-Metzler paradox, an inverse relationship between the tariff absorption elasticity and firm productivity for products with high quality scope, and the reverse for products with low quality scope.

In particular, the impact of inflation is more pronounced on durable relative to non-durable goods. Using quarterly data from Canada, the UK and the USA, we demonstrate that these findings are consistent and robust across different econometric specifications. An open economy model with durable and non-durable consumption, households with labor/leisure choice and money introduced through cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint on consumption expenditure alone could meaningfully explain these empirical observations. Our empirical findings of non-neutral and negative effects of inflation on real growth are significant for many economic models in the asset pricing literature that support a negative co-movement of stock prices and expected inflation. Moreover, such positive inflation premium in our model could provide economic explanation for a positive slope of the nominal term structure in the data.","[Mallick, Sushanta K.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Mohsin, Mohammed] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 510, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Mallick, SK (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk; mmohsin@utk.edu,,"Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680",,,,,30,21,24,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

A theoretical 2-inputs, 2-outputs model is developed to provide foundation of the relationship between ethanol policy and grains prices and agricultural inputs use. Simulations are run using the theoretical model results and empirical values of the demand and supply elasticities for given crops and inputs, and input and output shares in production, to determine the indirect and direct effects of ethanol policy on grain prices and input use. Results suggest that corn prices increase leading to an increase in wheat prices. Both land and energy use in corn production increases disproportionally more than what they decrease in wheat production. The relative increase of energy used in agriculture following the adoption of ethanol policies is especially interesting since it stands in contrast to the proclaimed goals of the policy. The results of this study may give greater knowledge to policy makers, who can be better informed with respect to the secondary effects of ethanol legislation.

In contrast to the standard subjective state space models, the resolution of uncertainty regarding the true state is endogenous and depends on the decision maker's actions. There need not be full resolution of uncertainty between periods. When the decision maker chooses what to consume, she also chooses the information structure to which she will be exposed. When she consumes outcomes, she learns her relative preference between them; after each consumption history, the decision maker's information structure is a refinement of the previous information structure. We provide the behavioral restrictions corresponding to a recursive representation exhibiting such a learning process. Through the incorporation of dynamics we are able to identify the set of preferences the decision maker believes possible after each history of consumption, without appealing to an environment with risk.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we study the impact of two fellowship programs recognizing educational performance in secondary schools in India. We find that the fellowship award is associated with a significant increase in the perceived value of education, by both increasing the perceived mean of earnings (0.74 standard deviations (SD)) and decreasing the perceived variance in earnings (1.03 SD) associated with additional years of schooling. The effects spill over only selectively to social and family networks. Peers exposed to successful students do not update their beliefs but parents of fellows report higher perceived returns to education. Peers of fellows are however more informed about fellowship opportunities and report a higher intention to apply for the fellowship, thus contributing to the persistence of the potential impact of the fellowship across different cohorts.

This paper employs a panel quantile regression model that takes unobserved individual heterogeneity and distributional heterogeneity into consideration. Moreover, to avoid an omitted variable bias, certain related control variables are included in our model. Our empirical results show that the effect of the independent variables on carbon emissions is heterogeneous across quantiles. Specifically, the effect of FDI on carbon emissions is negative, except at the 5th quantile, and becomes significant at higher quantiles. Energy consumption increases carbon emissions, with the strongest effects occurring at higher quantiles. Among the high-emissions countries, greater economic growth and population size appear to reduce emissions. The results of the study also support the validity of the halo effect hypothesis in higher-emissions countries. However, we find little evidence in support of an inverted U-shaped curve in the ASEAN-5 countries. In addition, a higher level of trade openness can mitigate the increase in carbon emissions, especially in low-and high-emissions nations. Finally, the results of the study also provide policymakers with important policy recommendations.

The production of the future comprises besides the allocation of resources on different instruments (technologies, financial products) also the design of the instruments. Specialization and diversification considerations point to the advantages of targeting instruments to a rich set of possible future states. But, if a rich state space comes with unreliable probability measures, the actions based on such a set will be unreliable, too. The proliferation of financial products is a salient example. This paper argues that an appropriate model for dealing with uncertainty keeps the knowledge required by the model from its user in line with the available knowledge. In particular, it proposes to order state spaces by their granularity and coverage. Appropriate upper bounds are derived for these characteristics. A practical implication of the presented approach would be to limit financial product innovation.","[Falkinger, Josef] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurichbergstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Falkinger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurichbergstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",josef.falkinger@econ.uzh.ch,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,,,,,23,1,1,0,7,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 17,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201624.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-24,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DY7OB,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385317500001,0

In this context, should a worldwide uniform carbon tax be added to these local taxes to correct the global warming externality? We address this question in a second best framework a la Ramsey, where public goods have to be financed through distortionary taxation and the cost of public funds has to be weighted against the utility of public goods. We show that when lump-sum transfers between countries are allowed for, the second best tax on the polluting good may be decomposed into three parts: one, country-specific, dealing with the local negative externality, a second one, country-specific, dealing with the cost of levying public funds, and a third one, global, dealing with the global externality and which can be interpreted as the carbon price. Our main contribution is to show that the uniformity of the carbon price should still hold in this second best framework. Nevertheless, if lump-sum transfers between governments are impossible to implement, international differentiation of the carbon price is the only way to take care of equity concerns.","[D'Autume, Antoine; Schubert, Katheline] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Withagen, Cees] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Paris School of Economics; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"D'Autume, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",dautume@univ-paris1.fr; schubert@univ-paris1.fr; cwithagen@feweb.vu.nl,,,French National Research Agency (ANR) under the CLEANER project [ANR.NT09.505778]; FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant [269788]; European Research Council (ERC) [269788] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),French National Research Agency (ANR) under the CLEANER project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC),"We thank Julien Daubanes, Pierre Lasserre, Stephane Gauthier, and especially Roger Guesnerie for useful discussions.

This paper examines how teacher incentives, both pecuniary and non-pecuniary, correlate with teacher effort. Using school survey data from Lao PDR, we estimate measures of teacher effort, including the number of hours that teachers spend preparing for classes and teacher provision of private tutoring outside of class hours, which are not the typical measures used in previous research. Estimation results fit well under the standard labour supply framework and indicate that greater teacher effort is associated with non-pecuniary incentives such as more teacher autonomy over teaching materials and monitoring as measured by the existence of an active parent-teacher association and the ability of school principals to dismiss teachers. Methodologically, this paper provides a detailed derivation of a simultaneous OLS-probit model with school random effects that can jointly estimate teacher work hours and tutoring provision.","[Dang, Hai-Anh H.] World Bank, Data Dev Grp, Surveys & Methods Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [King, Elizabeth M.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; Brookings Institution,"Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，World Bank, Data Dev Grp, Surveys & Methods Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hdang@worldbank.org; bethking1818@gmail.com,"Dang, Hai-Anh/AAW-5169-2021","Dang, Hai-Anh/0000-0003-4913-5291; King, Elizabeth M./0000-0003-3609-1736",,,,,46,1,1,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Although the model applies to many local congestible public facilities (such as libraries, museums and public swimming facilities), our main motivation is the problem of providing and pricing road infrastructure in federal states. The two-region model we develop allows for spill-overs between regions, it takes into account congestion, and it captures demand heterogeneity both between and within regions. Regional decisions are taken by majority voting; federal decisions are taken by a minimum winning coalition in a legislature of regionally elected representatives. We have the following results. First, when users form the majority in at least one region, decentralized decision making performs certainly better than centralized decision making if spill-overs are not too large. Centralized decisions may yield higher welfare than decentralization only if users have a large majority and the infrastructure in a given region is intensively used by both local and outside users. Second, if non-users form a majority in both regions, centralized decision making and decentralized decision making yield the same socially undesirable outcome, with prices that are much too high. Third, the performance of decentralized supply is strongly enhanced by local self-financing rules; this prevents potential exploitation of users within regions.","[De Borger, Bruno] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Proost, Stef] KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven,"De Borger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",bruno.deborger@uantwerpen.be; stef.proost@kuleuven.be,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",,,,,32,9,9,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

First, all policymaker types should become less tough on inflation over time and secondly, types that weigh output more should have a more pronounced shift. Voting data from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee strongly support both predictions. Counterfactual results indicate signalling has a substantial impact on interest rates over the business cycle, and improves the committee designer's welfare.

The interaction between asymmetric information and ambiguity aversion gives rise to some interesting results. First, for some parameter values, there exists a unique pooling equilibrium where both types of insurees buy full insurance. Second, in separating equilibria where the low risks are underinsured, their equilibrium contract involves more coverage than under standard expected utility. Finally, due to the endogeneity of commitment to the menus offered by insurers, our model has always an equilibrium which is unique (in terms of allocation) and interim incentive efficient (second-best).","[Koufopoulos, Kostas] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece; [Kozhan, Roman] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Piraeus; University of Warwick,"Kozhan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",koufop@unipi.gr; Roman.Kozhan@wbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,3,4,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Employing two additional treatment conditions, the paper explores (i) whether CRT-scores are linked to preferences for cooperation or to a better understanding of the incentive structure; and (ii) the association between CRT-scores and contributions, if choices are elicited under time pressure. A time limit should make it harder for participants to base their choices on cognitive reflection. I find a strong and positive relationship between CRT-scores and contributions in a standard one-shot PGG. This relationship is fully moderated by the presence of time pressure. Thus, features of the decision environment can affect the link between cognitive abilities and PGG contributions. Finally, there is only a weak relationship between CRT-scores and the ability to understand the incentive structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, given that adaptive measures are limited, it is possible that climate change will affect food availability and increase price volatility. This essay presents a synthesis of the evidence of the effects that climate change has on the agricultural sector, with a special emphasis on Latin America. This revision makes it clear that the effects are going to be heterogeneous and that they could very well be costly. Therefore, public policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time promoting adaptive measures to climate change, are essential. The essay concludes with some considerations on future research topics that could contribute to the design of said public policies.","[Lopez Feldman, Alejandro J.] CIDE, Div Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Cortes, Danae Hernandez] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The approach implemented in the article involves evaluation and comparison of the mispricing series of the WIG20 index futures listed on the WSE, in a one-year time span before and after the regulatory change introduced in 2010. The results show that lifting short sale constraints has increased the efficiency of the Polish futures market. There was a decline both in the number of mispricing occurrences, and in the mean level and dispersion of deviations from the fair values, especially with regard to underpriced contracts series. The study reveals that, in contrast to the pre-event period, after the regulatory change the arbitrage opportunities were virtually absent for investors bearing the highest transaction costs.","[Marcinkiewicz, Edyta] Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland",Lodz University of Technology,"Marcinkiewicz, E (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland.",edyta.marcinkiewicz@p.lodz.pl,"Marcinkiewicz, Edyta/N-4203-2018","Marcinkiewicz, Edyta/0000-0002-2229-4084",,,,,36,4,4,0,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This paper shows that real wage rigidities decrease this upper bound, but coefficients in the range of those on the Taylor rule place the economy well within the determinacy region. However, when there is time-variation in the share of firms who finance their inputs (i.e. Markov-switching) then inflation targeting interest rate rules frequently result in indeterminacy, even if the central bank also targets output. Adding a nominal growth target to the policy rule can often alleviate this indeterminacy and therefore anchor inflation expectations.","[Smith, A.

Conditional on firm size and many other variables, employees in firms with more layers are less likely to enter entrepreneurship, to become self-employed, and to switch to another employer. The effects of layers are much stronger for business creation than for job switching and they are stronger for entrepreneurship than for self-employment. We discuss two potential explanations for the distinctive hierarchy effect we find. Part of the effect could be to be due to preference sorting by employees, and part due to employees in firms with fewer layers having a broader range of skills. One test showing that the probability of entrepreneurship increases with their prior rank in an organization is consistent with ability sorting and inconsistent with preference sorting.

This is relevant for several reasons, but the most obvious perhaps is that economic reform will be difficult if faced by strong resistance from citizens. In this paper, individual data from Round 4 of the Afrobarometer surveys is used to investigate how support for economic reforms is influenced by factors falling under the following broad categories: (i) Economic variables; (ii) group identity and fairness variables; (iii) Institutional and state/government variables; (iv) Demographic and control variables. An individual's trust in the president and the belief that the government manages the economy well are two of the most significant and robust factors. This is in keeping with the results found in Williamson (The Political Economy of Policy Reform, Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC, ). Another robustly significant variable is satisfaction with how democracy works in the country. Variables related to ethnic identity and community membership also play a significant role in support for costly economic reforms, which is in line with the theories put forward by van de Walle (African Economies and the Politics of Permanent Crisis, 1979-1999. Cambridge University Press, New York, ). Females are less likely to support economic reforms, while individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to support economic reforms.","[Fors, Heather Congdon] Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1,POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Fors, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Vasagatan 1,POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",heather.fors@economics.gu.se,"Fors, Heather/JQI-8189-2023",,,,,,36,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The objective function is derived from the limit of discrete-time models with endogenous transaction costs due to optimal dealer behavior. We solve the model explicitly and the intuitive solution is also the limit of the solutions of the corresponding discrete-time models. We show how the optimal high-frequency trading strategy depends on the nature of the trading costs, which in turn depend on dealers' inventory dynamics. Finally, we provide equilibrium implications and illustrate the model's broader applicability to micro- and macro-economics, monetary policy, and political economy. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Because time is irreversible, the direction of the bias crucially affects the agent's ability to credibly communicate information. When the agent favors late decision making, full information revelation often occurs. In this case, centralized decision making, where the principal retains authority and communicates with the agent, implements the optimal decision-making rule. When the agent favors early decision making, communication is partial, and the optimal decision-making rule is not implemented.

Over the last two decades, East Asia has been one of the most successful regions in the world to build and connect cross-border supply chains. Introducing a new and simple analytical tool, we show that since 1999, East Asia has been successful in consolidating its role as a global manufacturing hub and is sourcing an increasing share of intermediate and capital goods directly from the region. Being a thriving manufacturing hub has also triggered rising demand for consumption goods. All East Asian countries, except the PRC, are selling an increasing share of their consumption goods within the region. Furthermore, more consumption goods from outside the region are also being attracted to East Asia. If these trends were to continue, East Asia has the potential to transform into one of the world's largest malls. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, we propose a cost-risk model that can properly plan generation and determine efficient technology portfolios through balancing the benefits of energy source diversification and cost of security of supply through the provision of various generation frequency control and demand side services, including preservation of system inertia levels. We do so through a scenario-based cost minimization framework where the conditional value at risk (CVaR), associated with costs under extreme scenarios of fossil fuel prices combined with hydrological inflows, is constrained. The model can tackle problems with large data sets (e.g. 8760 hours and 1000 scenarios) since we use linear programming and propose a Benders-based method adapted to deal with CVaR constraints in the master problem. Through several analyses, including the Chilean main electricity system, we demonstrate the effects of renewables on hedging both fossil fuel and hydrological risks; effects of security of supply on costs, risks and renewable investment; and the importance of demand side services in limiting risk exposure of generation portfolios through-encouraging risk mitigating renewable generation investment.

We characterize the set of equilibrium outcomes and establish that ex-ante revenue maximizing mechanisms are in this set. There is generally a continuum of revenue-ranked equilibrium outcomes. Focusing on the revenue-maximizing equilibrium, we show that the seller, in general, benefits from private information and does not benefit from committing to a disclosure or a certification technology. We also provide conditions under which the privacy of the seller's information does not affect revenue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Comparing China and India,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange-rate pass-through; Pricing-to-market; Quality; India; China,RATE PASS-THROUGH; TO-MARKET; TRADE; PRODUCT; PRICES; HETEROGENEITY; MODEL; COMPETITION; FAILURE; GRAVITY,"The product quality dimension has been rarely mentioned as a factor explaining the heterogeneous pricing strategies of exporters. This could underestimate the degree of mark-up adjustment and the extent of incomplete exchange rate pass -through (ERPT) at a disaggregated level across products and destination markets. This paper investigates the role of quality differentiation in price discrimination using data for China and India's exports disaggregated at the 6-digit product level across destination markets. The paper adopts an empirical approach that incorporates gravity model explanatory factors and allows disentangling the effect of quality on trade prices and volumes from that of other sources of price variation. After excluding short duration export spells, China's export prices denominated in foreign currency terms increase with the yuan's depreciation, implying an increase in exporters' mark-ups, but they decrease as expected in the case of India. However, mark-up increases decline with product quality and destination market income, as the elasticity of demand perceived by exporters increases. These findings remain robust to different measures of quality, samples, specifications, and to the potential endogeneity of quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We examine this prediction with novel data on injuries at US manufacturers using Chinese import growth in 1996-2007 as a shock to competition. The data show that injury rates in the competing US industries increase over the short to medium run, particularly at smaller establishments.

Results for financial integration are mixed; financial links as pairwise country characteristic are either insignificant or negatively signed (indicating a dampening of cross country spill-overs), but financial openness as characteristic of the receiving country amplifies spill-overs.

The model developed here explains the dynamics of growth based on a collection of different states that countries pass into and out of over time; in addition, these states are characterized by their own submodels and growth patterns. The transition matrix among the different states varies over time-depending on the conditioning variables of each country-with a linear dynamic for each state. We develop a generalization of Diebold's EM algorithm and estimate a sample model in a panel with a transition matrix conditioned on institutional quality and the investment level. We find three states of growth: stable growth, miraculous growth, and stagnation. The results show that institutional quality is an important determinant of long-term growth, whereas the investment level plays a variety of roles: it contributes positively in countries with high-quality institutions but is of little relevance in countries with medium-or low-quality institutions.","[Morier, Bruno; Teles, Vladimir Kuhl] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Rua Itapeva 474, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"Teles, VK (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Rua Itapeva 474, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",vladimir.teles@fgv.br,"TELES, VLADIMIR/C-4094-2013","TELES, VLADIMIR/0000-0002-0606-6102",,,,,40,3,3,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The approach allows identifying the average treatment effect on the entire population, even if the fixed effects affect potential outcomes under treatment and no treatment differently, which can cause heterogeneity in treatment effects among unobserved characteristics. Note that a popularly used standard difference-in-differences approach can only identify the average treatment effect on the treated. Moreover, the proposed approach allows time-varying treatment effects.

With the exit of zombie firms, (a) the industrial output growth rate would be higher by 2.12 percentage points, (b) the capital accumulation rate would be higher by 1.4 percentage points, (c) the employment growth rate would be higher by 0.84 percentage points, and (d) the rate total factor productivity growth would be higher by 1.06 percentage points.

Furthermore, I estimate the effect of duration of residence in the US on the immigrants overall patterns of time use. Time diary evidence indicates that, upon arrival to the US, Mexican immigrant men devote more time to market work and commuting than comparable non-Hispanic natives, regardless of their marital status. On the other hand, Mexican immigrant women devote the same amount of time to these activities as the nonHispanic reference groups, irrespective of the marital status. In addition, the trend data show that immigrant men decrease their paid work with years since migration while immigrant women increase it. Estimates indicate that, for married immigrant men there is a tradeoff between market work and household work, whereas for single immigrant men the tradeoff is between market work and leisure. Finally, Mexican immigrant women relinquish mostly passive leisure and sleep time to meet demands of family and market work.","[Vargas, Andres J.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Box 41014, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Vargas, AJ (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Box 41014, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",andres.vargas@ttu.edu,"Vargas, Andrés/JDM-8133-2023",,,,,,17,9,11,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using data from World Bank Investment Climate Survey and Annual Survey of Manufacturing Firms in China, we find evidence that the prevalence of SOEs in a city-industry where private firms reside will affect these firms' decision on the allocation of sales between interprovincial markets versus adjacent market. The direction of the effect on private firms, however, depends crucially on the private firms' access to credit. Specifically, the prevalence of SOEs leads to a higher propensity to sell to remote markets for firms with adequate financial access, whereas the opposite is true for firms who are credit constrained. We build a parsimonious model which links political/market distortion, market access, and credit constraint to explain these patterns, and argue that remote markets can serve as shelters for local distortions resulted from SOEs presence for some private firms.

The EA as a whole is a net loser of unexpected price-level decreases, with Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain losing most in per capita terms, and Belgium and Malta being net winners. Governments are net losers of deflation, while the household (HH) sector is a net winner in the EA as a whole. HHs in Belgium, Ireland, Malta, and Germany experience the biggest per capita gains, while HHs in Finland and Spain turn out to be net losers. Considerable heterogeneity exists also within the HH sector: relatively young middle class HHs are net losers of deflation, while older and richer HHs are winners. As a result, wealth inequality in the EA increases with unexpected deflation, although in some countries (Austria, Germany, and Malta) inequality decreases due to the presence of relatively few young borrowing HHs. We document that HHs' inflation exposure varies systematically across countries, with HHs in high-inflation EA countries holding systematically lower nominal exposures.","[Adam, Klaus] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Zhu, Junyi] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Mannheim; Deutsche Bank,"Adam, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",adam@uni-mannheim.de; junyi.zhu@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,22,25,26,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The main finding is that a countercyclical fiscal response to these shocks lowers the likelihood of conflict. This result is stronger when considering positive shocks to the price of mineral commodities and negative shocks to the price of agricultural commodities as the triggers to macroeconomic cycles. The effect is focused on politically underdeveloped countries and has been stronger during the last decades.

Because gold does not serve as a hedge against macroeconomic declines, its expected real rate of return should be close to the risk-free rate of around 1%.

Few studies have previously been able to address this issue empirically. Using a novel database, the analysis conducted in this paper finds that, other things being equal, the credibility of the monetary authority is likely to be higher in those European transition countries with currency board arrangements, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. The results also suggest that currency board arrangements are more likely to increase the credibility of the monetary authority in countries with a low level of trust in government and a weak economy. These findings imply that the maintenance of currency board arrangements in recent years in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria may have been advantageous.

Using the Health and Retirement Study, we find that only a quarter of newly disabled older workers in their 50s are accommodated by their employers in some way following onset of a disability. Importantly, we find that few employer characteristics explain which workers are accommodated; rather, employee characteristics, particularly the presence of personality traits correlated with assertiveness and open communication, are highly predictive of accommodation. We also find that if employer accommodation rates could be increased, disabled workers would be significantly more likely to delay labor force exit for up to two years.

We analyze the dynamic adjustment to an increase in progressivity and show that the economy will converge to an equilibrium growth path with nondegenerate distributions of both income and wealth. The role of the endogeneity of labor supply is emphasized and shown to have a major impact on the nature of the transitional path, as a result of the impact of the progressive tax on agents' work incentives. Our theoretical analysis is supplemented with, and supported by, numerical simulations, which generally match the empirical evidence rather closely. We also show that the responses of the different income groups contrast sharply from one another so that focusing on the economy-wide average provides an incomplete picture.","[Koyuncu, Murat] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Bebek, Turkey; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Bogazici University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Koyuncu, M (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Bebek, Turkey.",mkoyuncu@boun.edu.tr; sturn@uw.edu,,"Koyuncu, Murat/0000-0001-8573-2291",European Union [268472]; Bogazici University Research Fund (BAP) [5601],European Union(European Union (EU)); Bogazici University Research Fund (BAP)(Bogazici University),"We thank participants of the APET conferences held in Istanbul in June 2010 and in Seattle in July 2014, the ASSET conference held in Alicante in October 2010, the workshop Advances in Dynamic Macroeconomics held in Bolzano in May 2011, and the RCEA Workshop on Advances in Business Cycles and Economic Growth Analysis held in Rimini in May 2011, as well as seminar participants at the University of Groningen, Bilkent University, and Catolica University, Lisbon, for their comments on preliminary versions of this paper.

After excluding these three components, retirement does not have an effect on the remaining non-durable expenditures.

While one may agree with Taylor's empirical analysis and accept his demonstration that his proposed rule would lead to a more stable economic environment, it is unclear whether central banks are capable of avoiding bubbles by simply following the Taylor rule. One can construct various Taylor rules from the data. Some of those rules model what the Federal Reserve actually did. Following the specific type of Taylor rule recommended by John Taylor would in fact amount to a better monetary policy, but only because it calls for setting interest rates higher. In the second section, we introduce Taylor rules. In the third section, we apply these rules to monetary policy since 2001.The fourth section situates the Taylor rule in the Wicksellian framework of interest rates and macroeconomic stability. In the fifth section, we discuss the effects of policy rules on macroeconomic stability.","[Machaj, Mateusz] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Machaj, M (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",m.machaj@prawo.uni.wroc.pl,,,,,,,49,5,5,0,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

It outlines a simple model of human capital with a finite event space based upon dual process theory from cognitive psychology. The model integrates behavioral choice with rational choice via learning by doing, and implies a learning by doing curve that does a good job fitting the data in Jovanovic and Nyarko (1995). It is also shown that if the criteria for performance is deterministic - namely for each event there is a bright line optimal decision, then even if the event space is infinite, behavior converges to rational choice for a large class of similarity measures. The implications of this approach are illustrated with some evidence from the literature on short run versus long run labor supply in the context of unemployment insurance, and the hours choice of taxi drivers in New York City.

In addition, their uncertain production volumes also affect the investment risks of other plant types through the impact on power prices and residual demand. Increasing RES shares thus potentially increase overall investment risks in power markets, which many analysts consider to be a potential problem. Against this background, this paper compares investment risks of different technologies in markets with increasing shares of variable RES. It further analyses how generation mixes are affected by these investment risks if the risks are evaluated on a stand-alone basis or in a plant portfolio context of a private firm. For this purpose, a stylized investment and dispatch model is used to conduct Monte Carlo simulations from which risk measures are derived. The results show that capital intensive RES face the highest stand-alone risks, since their profits are most affected by the power price risk. However, the results further indicate that the stand-alone risks of variable RES decrease with their share in the market because of a negative correlation of output and price risk. In addition, RES have a risk benefit in firm plant portfolios in terms,of constituting a hedge against losses of fossil fuel plants. This positive portfolio effect, however, rapidly decreases and becomes negative with increasing RES shares in the market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The indices are based on the monthly data collected from China's inter-bank markets, stock markets, foreign exchange markets and debt markets. Using these two indices, the authors identify the episodes of systemic financial stress, and then evaluate the indices. The empirical results suggest that the CNFSI performs better than the CNFCI. Furthermore, the authors propose four leading indicators for monitoring China's financial instability, and provide a primary early warning system for China's macroprudential regulations. Finally, they conduct a test to evaluate the predictive power of the CNFSI and the early warning system with reference to the 2015 episode.

Much of the literature focuses on the efficiency aspects of a decentralized provision of public services, but decentralization may also increase growth by raising the ability of the political system to innovate and carry out reforms. In contrast, some authors argue that decentralization increases corruption and government inefficiency, and thus may diminish growth. Given this theoretical ambiguity, several studies have attempted to identify the effect of decentralization on economic growth empirically over the last two decades. We review and conduct a meta-analysis of this empirical literature.

The first model for which this has been demonstrated was the image scoring mechanism. But analytical work on the simplest possible case, the binary scoring model, has shown that even small errors in implementation destabilize any cooperative regime. It has thus been claimed that for indirect reciprocity to stabilize cooperation, assessments of reputation must be based on higher-order information. Is indirect reciprocity relying on first-order information doomed to fail? We use a simple analytical model of image scoring to show that this need not be the case. Indeed, in the general image scoring model the introduction of implementation errors has just the opposite effect as in the binary scoring model: it may stabilize instead of destabilize cooperation.

Coase's realism by considering the relationship between theories and facts in his methodology. I focus especially on Coase's criticisms of Friedman's 1953 essay, as set out in a lecture published in 1982. It is shown that in developing his argument, Coase applies his institutional economics to address the question of how economists, operating within a regulated market for ideas, choose their theories. He calls for realism in methodology and carries out an empirical study of economists' choices. He explores how the profession is regulated and highlights how discourse impacts on the functioning of science. A key question addressed within this paper is: how can Coase maintain a sociological and rhetorical view of science without falling into relativism? I identify the different motives for theory choice that Coase considers and show that his answer is both institutional and epistemic. This helps to clarify the status of the empirical basis in Coase's methodology and sheds new light on the nature of his realism. I conclude by carrying out a reflexive analysis of Coase's text as a text that attempts to justify the methodology on which it is itself based.","[Bertrand, Elodie] Univ Paris 01, PHARE, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Bertrand, Elodie] CNRS, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bertrand, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PHARE, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.;Bertrand, E (通讯作者)，CNRS, Maison Sci Econ,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",elodie.bertrand@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,104,2,2,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

These qualities come out clearly in Equilibrio generale ed equilibrio macroeconomico (1965a), interpreted here as the initial step in a process that eventually brought Graziani to the final rejection of methodological individualism and the reconstruction of microeconomics on macroeconomic bases achieved with The Monetary Theory of Production (2003). In his 1965 book, Graziani shows that, save for the Sraffian-Kaldorian heterodox alternative, extending Walras to dynamics in a multisectoral framework requires assumptions logically equivalent to those of single good models. This also points implicitly towards the need of interpreting the mainstream temporary equilibrium method in terms of path dependency when it refers to multiple sectors, and thus precludes that it converges towards a 'plain', long-term intertemporal general equilibrium. The latter is a notion generally associated with the name of Walras and early marginalists, but which owes much to later developments by Hayek, Lindahl and Hicks. For the single period, Graziani's work on the monetary circuit can be read as an original variant of the monetary temporary equilibrium of Myrdal, where money and debt, combined with errors in exogenous expectations, explain the path-dependency of short-term equilibria. For continuation analysis, this is completed with insights from Wicksell, Schumpeter, Marx and Kalecki, whereby the circuit provides a simple explanation of the Keynesian fallacy of composition critique of microeconomics. But the book is also an important contribution to an Italian debate on capital theory, which emerged mainly in Il Giornale degli Economisti in the 1960s, in parallel with the more cosmopolitan 'two Cambridge capital controversies' that developed at the same time in the top American and British journals. Both originated in Sraffa's famous 1960 contribution and should thus be examined together.","[Cingolani, Massimo] European Investment Bank, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Cingolani, M (通讯作者)，European Investment Bank, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",,,,,,,,107,2,2,0,6,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We show that when individuals are loss averse, governments may use trade policy to shield the domestic economy from large food price shocks. This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and trade policy. Specifically, unilateral actions give rise to a multiplier effect: when a shock drives up the price of food, exporters respond by imposing restrictions, while importers wind down protection, thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further trade policy activism. We test the key prediction of the theory with a new dataset that comprises monthly information on trade measures across 77 countries and 32 food products for the period 2008-11, finding evidence of a multiplier effect in food trade policy. These findings contribute to inform the broader debate on the proper regulation of food trade policy within the multilateral trading system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on an important trade-off facing modern firms: firms can acquire the property of all the innovations developed by their employees and can greatly increase their profits, yet this type of private intellectual property rights regime can discourage the innovative effort of the very same workers. Allowing workers to carry their knowledge outside the firm eliminates this disincentive. Hence, strategic complementarities may exist between innovative partners and a disclosure driven intellectual property rights regime, and passive employees and a private intellectual property rights regime.

We distinguish among four dimensions of religion: belonging to a religious denomination, believing certain religious propositions, bonding to religious practices, and behaving in a religious manner. An empirical analysis of data from 30 OECD countries with multiple data points per country covering the period 1984-2010 suggests a positive relationship between religion and business ownership based on those dimensions that reflect the internal aspects of religiosity (i.e., believing and behaving). We do not observe a significant association for those dimensions that reflect more external aspects of religion (i.e., belonging and bonding). These results suggest that the social capital perspective prevails the value perspective, at least when internal aspects of religiosity are concerned. More generally, our study demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between different dimensions of religion when investigating the link between religion and entrepreneurship.","[Hoogendoorn, Brigitte; Rietveld, Cornelius A.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Stel, Andre] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [van Stel, Andre] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Trinity College Dublin; Kozminski University,"Hoogendoorn, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bhoogendoorn@ese.eur.nl,,"Hoogendoorn, Brigitte/0000-0001-8078-9520; Van Stel, Andre/0000-0003-4512-654X",,,,,86,26,33,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We show the existence and uniqueness of a pure Nash equilibrium when the players have heterogeneous risk preferences and under certain assumptions on the rate of return and failure probability of the resource. Greater competition, vis-a-vis the number of players, increases the failure probability at the Nash equilibrium; we quantify this effect by obtaining bounds on the ratio of the failure probability at the Nash equilibrium to the failure probability under investment by a single user.

Contrarily, expansion can be perceived as zero-sum. Capital and production relocate from higher to lower wage regions while labour does the opposite, possibly raising unemployment and reducing wages in the higher wage regions. The general public in these countries may come to oppose EU expansion attributing any deterioration in their work situation to the gains of new citizens of the European Union. Analysis of changes in Irish attitudes towards EU expansion in 2002, 2007 and 2009 finds no evidence of a link from lowered economic conditions to increased opposition to EU expansion. The only evidence for zero-sum thinking is that diminished economic circumstances are associated with increased opposition to immigration, but this is not associated with increased opposition to further EU expansion.","[Jackson, John E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mach, Bogdan W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Polit Studies, Warsaw, Poland; [Miller-Gonzalez, Jennifer L.] Univ Michigan, Weiser Ctr Emerging Democracies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Jackson, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jjacksn@umich.edu; bmach@isppan.waw.pl; jlymille@gmail.com,"Mach, Bogdan W/GPP-3212-2022",,,,,,35,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We characterize Pareto optimal income taxes that do not condition on how much of an individual's income is earned in each of the two activities. These optimal taxes feature an externality-corrective term, the magnitude of which depends both on the Pigouvian correction that would obtain if rent-seeking incomes could be perfectly targeted and on the relative impact of rent-seeking externalities on the private returns to traditional and to rent-seeking activities. If rent-seeking externalities primarily affect other rent-seekers, for example, the optimal correction lies strictly below the Pigouvian correction. A calibrated model indicates that the gap between the Pigouvian and optimal correction can be quantitatively important. Our results thus point to a hefty informational requirement for correcting rent-seeking externalities through the income tax code.","[Rothschild, Casey] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Scheuer, Florian] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Scheuer, Florian] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wellesley College; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Scheuer, F (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",scheuer@stanford.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Rothschild, Casey/0000-0002-8960-7997",Harvard University; UC Berkeley; Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University,Harvard University; UC Berkeley; Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University,"We are especially grateful to Ivan Werning and two anonymous referees for numerous valuable suggestions.

This paper uses a panel of lottery sales for U.S. states covering the period 1980-2000 to test hypotheses regarding the impact of educational earmarking on lottery purchases. Our estimates suggest that states earmarking all or part of their revenue to education experience an increase in lottery sales between 11% and 25 %, depending on the specification of state trends. Whether the propensity for earmarking to increase sales is viewed positively or negatively depends largely on one's ethical and moral views of lotteries.","[Stivender, Carol O.; Gaggl, Paul; Amato, Louis H.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Farrow-Chestnut, Tonya E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Stivender, CO (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",costiven@uncc.edu; pgaggl@uncc.edu; ltamato@uncc.edu; tfarrow@uncc.edu,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Her treatment is detailed and, to a large extent, thorough. However, Jacobson fails to discuss the development of effective lead teaching experience in graduate school as a (potentially central) aspect of job market preparation. In the present comment, we develop and summarize a job posting and placement data set that focuses on Ph.D. candidates from non-top-tier programs. The data strongly suggests that the development of lead teaching experience in graduate school, rather than an optional line on one's vita, is an often pivotal element of realized job placement for Ph.D. candidates of non-top-tier programs. These findings corroborate with List's (2000) finding that, a candidate's teaching portfolio was highly influential in the academic market (p. 197). We also discuss the acquisition of lead teaching experience and benefits of early teaching experience that may extend beyond first job placement.","[Walia, Bhavneet; Sanders, Shane] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Decis Sci, 430 Stipes Hall,429 Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Walia, Bhavneet] Western Illinois Univ, Econ, 430 Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Sanders, Shane] Western Illinois Univ, 429 Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA",Western Illinois University; Western Illinois University; Western Illinois University,"Sanders, S (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Decis Sci, 430 Stipes Hall,429 Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.;Sanders, S (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, 429 Stipes Hall, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.",b-walia@wiu.edu; sd-sanders@wiu.edu,,,,,,,7,2,3,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In addition, we find that it is possible in the monopoly optimum that the contract for low-demand agents is more expensive than the one for high-demand agents if the extent of interaction with agents from the opposite market side is contract-specific.","[Boehme, Enrico] Univ Marburg, Chair Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Barfussertor 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Böhme, E (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Chair Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Barfussertor 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.",boehmee@staff.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,25,3,4,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Revenue conditionality matters more for low-income countries, particularly those where revenue ratios are below the group average.

We use our data to systematically document the tendency of countries to implement policies that both lower the corporate tax rate and broaden the corporate tax base. This correlation informs our interpretation of previous estimates of the relationship between corporate tax rates and corporate tax revenues, which typically do not include comprehensive measures of the corporate tax base definition. We then re-examine the relationship between corporate tax rates and corporate tax revenues. We find that accounting for unobserved heterogeneity attenuates the relationship between corporate tax rates and corporate tax revenues, and increases the implied revenue-maximizing tax rate.

We explain when the compensation plans that are most common in practice fixed salaries, quota-based bonuses, commissions, or a combination thereof are optimal. Fixed salaries are optimal for small revenue-cost ratios. Quota-based bonuses (commissions) should be used if the revenue-cost ratio takes intermediate (large) values. If firms face demand uncertainty, markets are rather thin, and the revenue-cost ratio large, firms should combine a commission with a quota-based bonus. If word-of-mouth advertising affects sales, a dynamic commission that increases over time can be optimal. When entering a new market or launching a new product, firms should install long-term bonus plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis covers the period 2007-2014, which accounts for the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. To examine the convergence dynamics of these financial markets, we have employed the Phillips and Sul (2007) methodology, which uses a nonlinear time-varying factor model. This paper provides a comprehensive picture of the financial systems within CEE by testing the convergence of their stock markets together with their credit default swap spreads, long-term government bonds, and the banking sector. The empirical findings show that the CEE financial markets do not form a homogenous convergence club. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, the disparities between these financial markets have been amplified. The striking divergence revealed by our analysis emphasizes the different levels of development within the CEE financial markets. The CEE countries should implement further structural reforms in order to achieve greater financial convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This expected quality is based on cues available before purchase, among which price is noteworthy, as consumers tend to believe that higher prices imply higher quality. But price also stresses the consumers' budget restriction, inducing a double -and conflicting- global effect on purchase probability. Using the traditional formulation of Random Utility Models for experience goods (i.e. introducing all attributes directly in the utility function) can lead to an endogeneity problem due to the omission of expected quality, introducing bias on the results. Using a stated wine choice experiment conducted in China as a case study, we correct for endogeneity by modelling each alternative's expected quality as a latent variable, explained by all available quality cues, including price. Then we explain choice as a trade-off between price and expected quality. This allows us to separate both effects of price and correct for at least one source of endogeneity while being consistent with behavioural theory; this has either been ignored or not treated correctly in previous literature. Moreover, as the model requires only a single quality indicator for each alternative to achieve identification, the respondents' burden increases marginally. Our results show that the use of latent variables reduces endogeneity and effectively allows to measure both effects of price separately, obtaining higher significance and correct signs for its parameters.

Empirical results from the two-stage Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) are highly consistent with those from the two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) . Specifically, the first-stage efficiency estimation indicates that the cost efficiency shows a slightly upward trend over the period 2000-2014, with the cost efficiency score being 0.93 and state-owned banks outperforming joint-stock banks (JSBs). The mixed process seemingly unrelated regression estimator which controls the potential endogeneity of public listing and foreign acquisition in the second stage shows that selection effects occur in the Vietnamese banking system: banks selected by the strategic foreign investors for partial acquisition and banks selected for public listing are more cost-efficient than those not selected. The short-term and long-term dynamic effects of foreign partial acquisition are documented: the cost efficiency of the Vietnamese banks post-partial acquisition is lower than prior-partial acquisition, and it experiences a decreasing trend since partial acquisition. However, the short-term and long-term dynamic effects of public listing are not evidenced: the cost efficiency of the banks after public listing is not statistically different from that before public listing, and it also reveals an unclear trend since public listing.","[Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen] Univ Econ HCMC, Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen; Roca, Eduardo; Sharma, Parmendra] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Nghiem, Son Hong] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Kelvin Grove, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Univ Econ HCMC, Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",thanh.nguyen8@griffithuni.edu.au,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/C-7405-2015; Nguyen, Thanh/W-1463-2019; Nghiem, Hong Son/F-6263-2010","Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/0000-0002-5228-1866; Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0002-7348-1381; Nghiem, Hong Son/0000-0002-2451-5290",,,,,39,35,38,2,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical strategy is based on a test of the direct relationship between the accumulated wealth and the uncertainty generated by the social security status, in particular the availability of health insurance, accounting also for the expectation to receive a retirement pension.

A reduction of consumption-based emissions can be achieved from both sides, a reduction in total consumption and a reduction in the emission intensity of the production processes. The power sector is one of the most carbon intensive industries along global production chains and the global deployment of renewable power generation technologies (RPGTs) is one possibility to significantly reduce emissions in this industry. This paper combines three different strands of literature, multi-regional input-output analysis, dynamic energy-economy-environment models and technological change in renewable energy (RE), to model the impact of the global diffusion of renewable energies on European consumption-based emissions. The global diffusion of RE technologies (photovoltaic and wind) depends on the development of technology costs, which are modeled using learning curves. With increasing deployment of renewables within the EU as well as increasing RD&D efforts, the EU can achieve an accelerated costs decrease for these technologies, thus fostering deployment of RPGTs at a global scale through the effect of decreasing costs. This behavior indirectly influences the electricity mix abroad, making it less carbon intensive, so that consumption-based emissions of the EU decrease.","[Wiebe, Kirsten S.] GWSmbH, Osnabruck, Germany; [Wiebe, Kirsten S.] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Wiebe, KS (通讯作者)，GWSmbH, Osnabruck, Germany.;Wiebe, KS (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",wiebe@gws-os.com,,"Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/0000-0003-3105-4194",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [Econ-C-026],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This paper is part of a research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the funding label Econ-C-026, whose support we gratefully acknowledge.

We show that this interaction between trust and firm organization contributes to shaping the pattern of comparative advantage: high-trust regions and countries exhibit larger value-added and export shares in delegation-intensive industries relative to other industries. Consistent with the idea that trust allows firms to expand beyond a narrow circle of family members and friends, such effects are driven by an increase in average firm size, reflecting in turn a shift of the size distribution away from the smallest firms and toward the small-to-medium ones. According to our estimates, trust is no less relevant than human or physical capital, or institutions in shaping the pattern of comparative advantage. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis exploits an original dataset containing inequality and crime statistics on more than 2000 Mexican municipalities over a 20-year period. To uncover the causal effect of inequality on crime, we use an instrumental variable for the Gini coefficient that combines the initial income distribution at the municipality level with national trends. Our estimates indicate that a one-point increment in the Gini coefficient between 2007 and 2010 translates into an increase of more that 36% in the number of drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. The fact that the effect found during the drug war is substantially greater is likely caused by the rise in rents to be extracted through crime and an expansion in the employment opportunities in the illegal sector through the proliferation of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), accompanied by a decline in legal job opportunities and a reduction in the probability of being caught given the resource constraints faced by the law enforcement system. Combined, the latter factors made the expected benefits of criminal activity shift in a socially undesirable direction after 2007.

In tracking the influence of these paragraphs on both theoretical and applied work, we also use them as a foothold for reflection on the process of theorizing to argue for the view that one cannot neglect the (changing) problematic that the theory is adduced to address, that the historical narrative behind a particular theorem is indispensable in understanding the theorem itself. This implicit theorizing of the process of theorizing then forces us to consider Stigler's distinction between textual and scientific exegesis and confront it to a second-order level of theorizing, and thereby bring out the continuity, possibly not quite seamless, between a theorem and its history.","[Khan, M.

The paper's thesis is that real and monetary analysis are both necessary for describing the capitalist cycle. The real model is in four parts. The first part is a simplified static Walrasian exchange. The second part uses a time dynamic to show price and productivity equilibrium over time. The third part defines surplus-value, capital, accumulation, profit and producer's surplus. The fourth part defines economic evolution and long-term analysis. Each of the four parts has a corresponding Mathematica program and a table of sample data. The real model shows a relationship between long term average profit, GDP and capitalization. A monetary model is then constructed which empirically defines monetary and real products, the capital-market, the real economy and investment. The monetary model is first described under conditions of laissez-faire. The concepts of appreciation, overinvestment and the capitalist cycle are defined with the aid of the real model. Finally, the post laissez-faire capitalist cycle is described with an emphasis on the government policies of post 1980 capitalism. The conclusion of the paper-based on the real and monetary models-is that post 1980 capitalism changes but does not eliminate the capitalist cycle because government policies do not address over-investment, rather these policies abet over-investment.",,,,mathecon99@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In equilibrium, randomization can take place over disjoint intervals of bids, equilibrium supports can have a rich structure, and non-monotonicity of the equilibrium may result in a positive probability of allocative inefficiency when the value of the prize is not common. Particular attention is paid to the case in which an increase in a bidder's posterior expected value of winning the auction is likely to be accompanied by a corresponding increase for the other bidder.

We conclude that except for the market factor, all of the factors including liquidity are not significant at even the 5% level using our GMM approach for almost all of the FF 12 sectors.","[Racicot, Francois-Eric; Rentz, William F.] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Racicot, Francois-Eric] Univ Ottawa, ESG UQAM, Chaire Informat Financiere & Org, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Racicot, Francois-Eric] Univ Ottawa, CPA Canada Accounting & Governance Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rentz, William F.] Univ Ottawa, Pens Fund Investment Comm, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rentz, William F.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Racicot, FE (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",racicot@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Racicot, François-Éric/O-3079-2019",,,,,,18,29,31,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The SPSM can be used to decompose a panel of real exchange rate series into two groups: a group of stationary series and a group of nonstationary series. We identify the stationary processes in the panel and demonstrate that Taylor rules holds for 7 of the 10 countries studied. These results imply that the choices and effectiveness of the monetary policies in Central Eastern European economies are highly influenced by external factors originating from the United States.

For many measures, including real GDP growth (our focus), the performance gap is large and significant. This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in systematically more expansionary monetary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather, it appears that the Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks, superior total factor productivity (TFP) performance, a more favorable international environment, and perhaps more optimistic consumer expectations about the near-term future.","[Blinder, Alan S.; Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Blinder, Alan S.; Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University,"Blinder, AS; Watson, MW (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Blinder, AS; Watson, MW (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",blinder@princeton.edu; mwatson@princeton.edu,,,,,,,48,74,85,2,40,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Though municipalities enjoy discretion in setting the local business tax rate, large fractions of municipalities - in some states even the majority - set identical tax rates. Our analysis shows that this tax-rate bunching is not the result of federal or state-level institutions. Possible explanations rest on partial coordination and yardstick competition. The role of the former is exemplified by the finding that small jurisdictions and jurisdictions sharing the same county are more likely to engage in bunching. Yardstick competition seems also relevant since jurisdictions for which strategic tax-setting should be associated with larger gains and lower cost are in fact more likely to set identical tax rates.

A Global VAR modelling approach is used to first assess the contribution of credit and asset price variables to real economic activity in a number of countries and regions. The GVAR model is based on 38 countries estimated over 1987-2013. An analysis on a sample excluding the post-financial crisis period is also provided to check whether financial variables have gained importance in explaining business cycle fluctuations over the recent past. In a second step, financial shocks are identified through sign restrictions in order to illustrate how financial and business cycles could be related. Overall, the paper shows that the importance of credit and asset price variables in explaining real economic fluctuations is relatively large, but has not significantly increased since the global financial crisis. The international transmission of financial shocks on business cycle fluctuations also tends to be large and persistent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Anthonisen, N",,,,"Anthonisen, Niels",,,Microeconomic shocks and macroeconomic fluctuations in a dynamic network economy,JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dynamic network economy; Granular hypothesis; Pareto distribution,AGGREGATE SHOCKS; POWER LAWS; ORIGINS,"The distribution of firm-sizes in the U.S. - or at least its upper tail - appears to be well described by a Pareto distribution with infinite variance. This fact forms the basis of 'the granular hypothesis proposed by Gabaix in his paper The Granular Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations (Econometrica, (2011)). The granular hypothesis provides a mechanism whereby independent firm-level shocks are capable of generating macroeconomic fluctuations. This paper considers the granular hypothesis in a new framework. It develops a DSGE model by superimposing a stochastic overlapping generations framework on a network. Idiosyncratic output shocks to individual firms are transmitted across the economy through income-expenditure channels. Specifically, firms represent vertices of the network, and a firm x is linked to another firm y if x employs one or more workers who purchase commodities produced by y. The paper's findings agree closely with results first discovered by Gabaix: if firm-sizes in an economy are described by a Pareto distribution, then independent firm-level shocks can generate macroeconomic fluctuations in accordance with the granular hypothesis. Furthermore, the model is capable of generating aggregate volatility of the same order of magnitude as occurs in reality. Thus the paper describes a new general equilibrium framework where macroeconomic fluctuations can arise as the consequence of independent firm-level shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find little evidence that this slowdown arises from growing mismeasurement of the gains from innovation in information technology related goods and services. First, the mismeasurement of information technology hardware is significant preceding the slowdown. Because the domestic production of these products has fallen, the quantitative effect on productivity was larger in the 1995-2004 period than since then, despite mismeasurement worsening for some types of information technology. Hence, our adjustments make the slowdown in labor productivity worse. The effect on total factor productivity is more muted. Second, many of the tremendous consumer benefits from the new economy such as smartphones, Google searches, and Facebook are, conceptually, nonmarket: Consumers are more productive in using their nonmarket time to produce services they value. These benefits raise consumer well-being but do not imply that market sector production functions are shifting out more rapidly than measured. Moreover, estimated gains in nonmarket production are too small to compensate for the loss in overall well-being from slower market sector productivity growth. In addition to information technology, other measurement issues that we can quantify (such as increasing globalization and fracking) are also quantitatively small relative to the slowdown.","[Byrne, David M.] Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA; [Fernald, John G.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Reinsdorf, Marshall B.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; International Monetary Fund,"Byrne, DM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA.",,"Byrne, David P./N-9509-2015","Byrne, David P./0000-0003-2133-0917; Byrne, David/0000-0001-8226-5181",,,,,88,90,105,0,15,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Despite the ethical debate that such an idea generates, only a few papers have dealt with this issue in depth, and they have just focused on the case of full compensation for regret. Therefore, based on efficiency, robustness, and ethical requirements, we characterise a social ordering function that formally connects the ideal of forgiveness to the problem of compensating individuals when they differ in both their preferences and their initial endowment. This social ordering allows us to rank allocations that may or may not be associated with different concerns for forgiveness.

We interpret this evidence by employing an estimated medium-scale DSGE model of the business cycle as a Data-Generating Process in a Monte Carlo exercise in which a Cholesky-VAR econometrician is asked to estimate the effects of an unexpected, temporary increase in the policy rate. Our structural DSGE model predicts conventional macroeconomic reactions to a policy shock. In contrast, our Monte Carlo VAR results replicate our evidence obtained with actual U.S. data. Hence, modest macroeconomic effects may very well be an artifact of Cholesky-VARs. A combination of supply and demand shocks may be behind the inability of Cholesky-VARs to replicate the actual macroeconomic responses. The difference in the VAR responses obtained with Great Inflation vs. Great Moderation data may be due to instabilities in the parameters related to households' and firms' programs, more than to a more aggressive systematic monetary policy. A Monte Carlo assessment of sign restrictions as an alternative identification strategy is also proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We employ a rich employer-employee matched dataset on the manufacturing industry in Taiwan, a newly industrialized economy, to quantify the significance of human capital spillovers and their effects on productivity gains. Using the ratio of higher-educated (university or above) employees in each city as the external human capital index of a plant (excluding the reference plant itself) and addressing the potential endogeneity of various unobservable factors attributable to the location of the plant, we find that within a given city, a 1 percent increase in the proportion of higher-educated employees will increase the productivity of plants in that city by approximately 0.93-1.15 percent. Furthermore, the productivity increases are found to be greater for high-tech plants and for those located in cities with science parks. This indicates that human capital spillovers are not only present, but stronger under greater technology intensities. Our measure of the monetary value of such spillover effects indicates that a 1 percent increase in the percentage of higher-educated employees in a city will raise the value-added per plant by US$15,937, or, equivalently, an increase of US$1.27 billion for the entire manufacturing industry.

Rather, it is a function of the sovereign debt market institution itself. Crisis, I argue, is not an occurrence, but an element fulfilling a precise technical function within this institution. It ensures the possibility of designating in the market's day-to-day mechanisms rather than analytical hindsight normal (tranquil, undisturbed) market functioning. To show this, I propose an alternative view on the institutional economics of sovereign debt markets. First, I engage literature on the emergent qualities of the institutions market and firm in product markets, concluding that the point of coalescence for markets is the approximation of an optimal observation of consumer tastes. I then examine the specific institution financial markets, where the optimal observation of economic fundamentals is decisive. For the specific sub-institution sovereign debt market, I conclude that the fundamentals in question country fundamentals oscillate between a status of observable fundamentals outside of markets and operationalized fundamentals influenced by market movements. This, in turn, allows me to argue that the specific case of the Eurozone crisis is due to neither of the two causes mentioned above. Rather, the notion of crisis takes on a technical sense within the market structure, guaranteeing the separation of herd behavior and isomorphic behavior on European sovereign debt markets. By the same token, the so-called Eurozone crisis ceases to be a crisis in the conventional sense.","[Engel, Sascha] Virginia Tech, ASPECT, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Engel, Sascha] Virginia Tech, Dept Polit Sci, Heterodox Econ & Int Polit Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Engel, S (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, ASPECT, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.;Engel, S (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Polit Sci, Heterodox Econ & Int Polit Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,52,1,1,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Concern has focused on increasing levels of nonmarital childbearing, as well as falling marriage rates that stem from both increases in the age at first marriage and greater marital instability. Often lost in these discussions is the fact that the decline of marriage has coincided with a rise in cohabitation. Many single Americans now live with a domestic partner and a substantial fraction of single mothers are cohabiting, often with the child's father. The share of women who have ever cohabited has nearly doubled over the past 25 years, and the majority of nonmarital births now occur to cohabiting rather than to unpartnered mothers at all levels of education. The emergence of cohabitation as an alternative to marriage has been a key feature of the post-World War II transformation of the American family. These changes in the patterns and trajectories of family structure have a strong socioeconomic gradient. The important divide is between college graduates and others: individuals who have attended college but do not have a four-year degree have family patterns and trajectories that are very similar to those of high school graduates.","[Lundberg, Shelly] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Demog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lundberg, Shelly; Pollak, Robert A.] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lundberg, Shelly] Univ Bergen, Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Pollak, Robert A.] Washington Univ, Econ, St Louis, MO USA; [Pollak, Robert A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stearns, Jenna] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bergen; Washington University (WUSTL); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lundberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Demog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Lundberg, S (通讯作者)，Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Lundberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Econ, Bergen, Norway.",slundberg@ucsb.edu; pollak@wustl.edu; stearns@umail.ucsb.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD042828] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,77,165,165,5,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Quantifying the impact QE has on the real economy, however, is not straightforward as standard tools such as VAR models cannot easily be applied. In this paper we use the Qual VAR model (Dueker, 2005) to combine binary information about QE announcements with an otherwise standard monetary policy VAR. The model filters an unobservable propensity to QE out of the observable data and delivers impulse responses to a QE shocks. In contrast to other empirical approaches, in our model QE is endogenously depending on the state of the business cycle and is studied in terms of unexpected policy shocks. We show that QE shocks lead to a fall in interest rates, an increase in stock prices and a rise in real economic activity and inflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Park, J",,,,"Park, Jongsang",,,The impact of depreciation savings on investment: Evidence from the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Taxes; Investment; Depreciation; Alternative Minimum Tax,INCENTIVES,"Over the past decade, the United States has offered investment incentives in the form of larger depreciation savings, namely, bonus depreciation. The neoclassical investment model implies that investment responds to changes in depreciation savings, but there have been few direct attempts to investigate this implication. This paper examines investment patterns surrounding the 1999 shortening of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) depreciation recovery periods, finding strong evidence that firms subject to the AMT increase investment in response to the AMT reform. The empirical results show that firms subject to the AMT increase their investment, measured as the ratio of capital expenditures to capital stock, by around 0.0418 to 0.0622, compared to firms subject to the regular tax. Given their average annual investment rate of approximately 0.27 during this period, the results imply a relative increase in investment of 15%-23%. By contrast, I find that the 2002 introduction of bonus depreciation, available both for firms subject to the regular tax and for firms subject to the AMT, affects both groups of firms similarly. The estimation uses an empirical specification developed from the Summers (1981) tax-adjusted q model, and the results imply that the responsiveness of investment to the tax term is somewhat larger than previously estimated.

International agreements bind Northern output whilst leaving room for the South under the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Act I considers the effects of reducing Northern output through tighter emission regulations. In the short run, traditional structuralist results such as a negative effect on Southern terms of trade and accumulation follow. In the long run the impact of Northern regulation is 'bottled up' within that region. This latter property vanishes once Act II allows for the creation of international permit markets. Permit trade relaxes the Northern output constraint whilst also establishing a channel through which the North directly influences Southern permit prices. The result in the short run is to reverse the effects of tighter Northern regulation on relative Southern terms of trade and accumulation, which now increase. In the long run, international permit trade leads to increased variability in the (1) global distribution of capital in response to tighter Northern regulation, and (2) intensity of Northern emissions in response to tighter Southern regulation. Thus, globalised permit exchanges generate new trade-offs between the global distribution of capital and environmental efficiency.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 824 Thompson Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It is excessive hoarding, not excessive thrift, that causes recessions and the failure of Say's law. The same failure to distinguish hoarding from thrift continues from The General Theory into the IS-LM model and into New Keynesian macroeconomics. On this particular question, economists should follow Silvio Gesell rather than John Maynard Keynes. The rate of interest in New Keynesian models should be interpreted as a negative Gesellian tax (that is, a subsidy) on holding money issued by the central bank.","[Rowe, Nicholas] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Rowe, N (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,,,,,,,2,4,4,1,6,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Environmental activism is becoming more widespread as humans are trying to tackle and mitigate climate change. In this paper, we ask how best a band can compensate for the carbon emissions generated by fans travelling to its shows. We first report on the various green initiatives and practices of the music industry. We then focus on greenhouse gas emissions that result from tours and concerts since they are one of the largest environmental impacts generated by the music industry. We take the perspective of the artist or band wishing to internalize their carbon emissions and present a model of carbon offsets in the context of rock concerts, which amounts to the private provision of a public good. In our model, bands have the option to include offsets in the ticket price or to offer voluntary offsets. To illustrate our point, we present a field study conducted by a Quebec rock band at shows in Montreal and in Europe to show how the artists can reduce the environmental impact of their concert by buying carbon credits equivalent to their fans' footprint. We show that at 1 % of the ticket price on average, the cost of carbon offsets is marginal and discuss the numerous challenges that arise for those artists wanting to engage in carbon offsetting.","[Connolly, Marie; Seguin, Charles] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Succ Ctr Ville,CP 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Dupras, Jerome] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Connolly, M (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Succ Ctr Ville,CP 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",connolly.marie@uqam.ca,,,,,,,48,2,2,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This paper investigates the effects of induced positive and negative emotions on cooperation and sanctioning behaviour in a one-shot voluntary contributions mechanism game, where personal and social interests are at odds. We concentrate on two specific emotions: anger and happiness. Our findings provide clear evidence that measures of social preferences are sensitive to subjects' current emotional states. Specifically, angry subjects contribute, on average, less than happy subjects and overall welfare as measured by average net earnings is lower when subjects are in an angry mood. We also find that how punishment is used is affected by moods: angry subjects punish harsher than happy subjects, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that anger, when induced, can have a negative impact on economic behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although switching in the inflation target does not affect determinacy, switches in the inflation response can cause indeterminacy. Satisfying the Taylor principle period by period is neither necessary nor sufficient for determinacy when inflation responses switch; indeterminacy can arise if monetary policy responds too aggressively to inflation in the active regime. Inflation target switches primarily impact the level of inflation, whereas inflation response switches primarily impact the volatility. Expecting an inflation target switch has minor effects on volatility, whereas expecting an inflation response switch raises volatility more substantially.","[Foerster, Andrew T.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Foerster, AT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Res Dept, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.",,,,,,,,32,14,14,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

We take into account the possibility that institutions are weak, i.e. there is corruption, and analyze how this affects the government's choice between cash and in-kind transfers. Our results show that the share of in-kind transfers (e.g. basic health care, public housing or food stamps), whose appropriation by corrupt politicians is more easily observed than in the case of cash transfers, increases with corruption. This positive relationship exists, however, only in highly democratic countries. We argue that voters use their political influence in democratic countries to ensure that a higher share of transfers is provided in kind thereby shielding transfers from appropriation by corrupt politicians.","[Hessami, Zohal] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Uebelmesser, Silke] Univ Jena, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Uebelmesser, Silke] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Konstanz; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Ifo Institut,"Hessami, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",zohal.hessami@uni-konstanz.de,,"Uebelmesser, Silke/0000-0001-5889-9061; Hessami, Zohal/0000-0002-0669-6913",,,,,66,9,9,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Peer punishment mechanisms have garnered particular attention and suggest that groups are able to self-govern. Research suggests that the effectiveness of peer punishment depends on a group's capacity to establish and enforce contribution norms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of such institutions when normative conflict makes contribution norms ambiguous. In an interior solution public good experiment, endowment heterogeneity and peer punishment are interacted. Results suggest that peer punishment induces greater contributions when endowments are homogeneous but does not increase contributions when endowments are heterogeneous. Across the payoff equivalent endowment conditions with the opportunity to punish, contributions and earnings are significantly lower when endowments are heterogeneous. This research suggests that the capacity of groups to self-govern is limited when normative conflict makes contribution norms ambiguous. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The situation was exceptional in a sense, that during the period of the financial crisis the Polish interbank market experienced liquidity surplus, and the main problem of the central bank was to regain confidence among commercial banks and stimulate interbank transactions. We concentrate on the spread between the rate of overnight interbank loans and the reference rate and based upon its dynamics we assess the monetary policy of the Polish central bank. Using econometric techniques we study how the central bank influenced the spread, when its control over it weakened and when was it strengthened. The study is supported by the results of the survey directed to the headquarters of commercial banks. We conclude that the ability of the central bank to control overnight rate was temporarily lost during the first phases of the financial crisis, but gradually regained after implementation of the confidence pact.","[Kliber, Agata] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Appl Math, Poznan, Poland; [Kliber, Pawe] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Math Econ, Poznan, Poland; [Puciennik, Piotr] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Poznan, Poland; [Piwnicka, Magorzata] Natl Bank Poland, Reg Branch Poznan, Dept Stat & Foreign Currencies, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Kliber, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Appl Math, Poznan, Poland.",agata.kliber@ue.poznan.pl; p.kliber@ue.poznan.pl; pplucien@amu.edu.pl; malgorzata.piwnicka@nbp.pl,"Kliber, Agata/P-6227-2019; Płuciennik, Piotr/AAG-3385-2020; Kliber, Paweł/AAD-2543-2022","Kliber, Agata/0000-0003-1996-5550; Kliber, Pawel/0000-0001-7796-6418; Pluciennik, Piotr/0000-0001-6535-9995",National Bank of Poland,National Bank of Poland,"The research was supported by the National Bank of Poland, through the project Wplyw swiatowego kryzysu gospodarczego 2007-2009 na rynek miedzybankowy w Polsce (Influence of the world financial crisis 2007-2009 onto the Polish interbank market) (2012).

We find evidence that aggregate saving ratio increases with income inequality using various inequality measures. In particular, the effect of income distribution on saving is greater and statistically more significant with in financially developed, rich and OECD countries. It suggests that the rich save much more than the poor under advanced financial system and in a rich country. We also find that the relationship between income inequality and saving ratio is closer in the 2000s than the 1990s.

In the model, we combine economic (labour and capital), environmental (freshwater) and energy inputs with a desirable output (GDP) and three undesirable outputs (CO2, methane and nitrous oxide emissions). We rank each country according to the optimum use of its resources employing a multiplicative extension of environmental DEA models. By computing partial efficiency scores for each input and output separately, we thus identify major sources of inefficiency for all sample countries. Based on the partial efficiency scores obtained from the model, we define aggregate economic, energy and environmental efficiency indexes for 2002, 2007 and 2011, reflecting points in time before and after the official enactment of the Kyoto Protocol. We find that for most countries efficiency scores increase over this period. In addition, there exists a positive relationship between economic and environmental efficiency, although, at the same time, our results suggest that environmental efficiency cannot be realized without first reaching a certain threshold of economic efficiency. We also find support for the Paradox of Plenty, whereby an abundance of natural and energy resources results in their inefficient use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the mainstream view in economics, as elsewhere, has been that even if radical uncertainty exists, either there is in principle nothing that can ever be done about it, or that even if one could in theory do something about it then the institutions required would be unreliable, and one would be better off without them. Thus the mainstream has worked as if it were realistic to ignore even the possibility of radical uncertainty. But one needs some conceptualisation of radical uncertainty, such as Keynes', before one can make such judgments. This paper presents an interpretation, to inform debate. The viewpoint taken here is mathematical, but this is not to deny the value of other views.","[Marsay, David] UCL, Inst Secur & Resilience Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Marsay, D (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Secur & Resilience Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",d.marsay@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,JAN 7,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,20161.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-1,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DA6EJ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367894700001,0

We send fictitious Malay and Chinese resumes to job advertisements, then analyse differentials in callback for interview attributable to racial identity, while controlling for applicant characteristics, employer profile and job requirements. We find that race matters much more than resume quality, with Malays - Malaysia's majority group - significantly less likely to be called for interview. Other factors, particularly language proficiency of employees, language requirements of jobs and profile of employers, influence employer biases. Applicants fluent in Chinese fare better, and Chinese-controlled and foreign-controlled companies are more likely to favour Chinese resumes, indicating that cultural compatibility explains part of the discrimination. Malay resumes tend to be perceived and prejudged adversely, and employers' attitudes towards public policy outcomes, particularly pertaining to education quality and employment opportunity in the public sector, also account for the observed racial disparities.","[Lee, Hwok-Aun] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Khalid, Muhammed Abdul] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies IKMAS, Bangi 43600, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Lee, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",halee@um.edu.my,"Lee, Hwok-Aun/B-8835-2010","Lee, Hwok-Aun/0000-0003-4513-5235",University of Malaya Research [RG112-11SBS],University of Malaya Research(Universiti Malaya),This work was supported by the University of Malaya Research [Grant number RG112-11SBS].,,30,31,34,4,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The Ratio system approach of the MOORA method and Intervalvalued fuzzy numbers have already proved themselves as the effective tools for solving complex decision-making problems. Therefore, in this paper an extension of the Ratio system approach of the MOORA method, which allows a group decision-making as well as the use of interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers, is proposed. Interval-fuzzy numbers are rather complex, and therefore, they are not practical for direct assigning performance ratings. For this reason, in this paper it has also been suggested the approach which allows the expression of individual performance ratings using crisp, interval or fuzzy numbers, and their further transformation into the group performance ratings, expressed in the form of interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers, which provide greater flexibility and reality compared to the use of linguistic variables. Finally, in this paper the weighted averaging operator was proposed for defuzzification of interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers.","[Stanujkic, Dragisa] Megatrend Univ, Fac Management Zajecar, Pk Suma Kraljevica Bb, Zajecar 19000, Serbia",,"Stanujkic, D (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Fac Management Zajecar, Pk Suma Kraljevica Bb, Zajecar 19000, Serbia.",dragisa.stanujkic@fmz.edu.rs,"Stanujkic, Dragisa/J-5645-2019","Stanujkic, Dragisa/0000-0002-6846-3074",Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia [TR33023],"Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This paper is a partial result of the project TR33023 financed by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.

In this paper, we examine whether this required condition is attained for the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), to the extent that the latter have sought to create a common currency area in 2010. Using the real growth rates as proxies for business cycles in the GCC countries, our findings from a continuous wavelet approach uncover that the real growth rates in most of the countries within the GCC region comove with the others over the short and medium terms, while long-term co-movement of real growth rates is only found in seven out of the 15 country pairs. In particular, the two major countries of the GCC, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, share common growth cycles with the remaining countries. We also find that, between the two potential country member candidates for the GCC, Jordan and Morocco, only Jordan's growth cycle tends to synchronize with the one in the existing GCC countries. Overall, these results underscore the heterogeneous degree of business cycle synchronization, across time and horizons, not only among the existing GCC countries but also between the existing and potential country members. Our time-frequency framework is thus useful in providing a straightforward answer on the prerequisite for the monetary union establishment in the GCC economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We do so by estimating the causal impact of a large shock to agricultural productivity the introduction of the heavy plow in the Middle Ages-on long run development. We build on the work of Lynn White, Jr. (1962), who argued that it was impossible to take proper advantage of the fertile clay soils of Northern Europe prior to the invention and widespread adoption of the heavy plow. We implement the test in a difference-in-difference set-up by exploiting regional variation in the presence of fertile clay soils. Using a high quality dataset for Denmark, we find that historical counties with relatively more fertile clay soil experienced higher urbanization after the heavy plow had its breakthrough, which was around AD 1000. We obtain a similar result, when we extend the test to European regions. Our findings substantiate that agricultural productivity can be an important driver of long-run development.

We exploit a panel of 276 micro price levels collected on a semi-annual frequency over two decades in 59 countries around the world, that enables us to distinguish between different types (global and local) of macro and micro shocks. We find that global macro and micro shocks are always associated with a slower response of prices than the respective local shocks. Focusing on structural monetary macro shocks, we show that prices reach their long-run value much slower in response to a global macro shock, as compared to the time it takes for prices to reach their long-run value in response to a local macro shock.

In contrast, trade in business, telecommunication and financial services continued growing at their pre-crisis rates and only services related to transport declined. Using trade data at the firm-product-destination level for Belgium, I show that during the crisis the elasticity of services exports with respect to GDP growth in destination countries was significantly different from that of goods exports. In particular, the negative income shock in partner countries affected exports of goods but not exports of services. This difference is economically sizable: if goods exports had had the same elasticity to GDP growth as services exports, their fall during the 2008-2009 collapse would have been only half what was observed.

It is unilaterally profitable for a seller to deter search under mild conditions, but sellers can suffer when all do so. When a seller cannot commit to its policy, it exploits the inference that those consumers who try to buy later have no good alternative, and in many cases the outcome is as if the seller must make an exploding offer. Search deterrence results in sub-optimal matching of products to consumers and often raises the price consumers pay.","[Armstrong, Mark] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Zhou, Jidong] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Oxford; Yale University,,,"Armstrong, Mark/C-4441-2008",,,,,,31,35,40,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It introduces a framework to characterize `shifts' in progressivity in health financing between two time periods using the popularly known Kakwani index of progressivity and other associated indices. It also decomposes the `shifts' in progressivity into the relative contributions of the changes in income distribution and the changes in the distribution of health payments. Further, it proposes graphics that statistically analyses how the `shifts' in progressivity vary along the distribution of income. A pro-poor (pro-rich) shift implies that the health financing mechanism is becoming more (less) progressive or less (more) regressive between two time periods. A proportional shift means that progressivity is constant between the two periods. This framework is applied to nationally representative household data from South Africa. It emerged that such characterization is a very useful tool for policy in assessing progress towards equitable health financing.","[Ataguba, John E.] Univ Cape Town, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Hlth Econ Unit, Anzio Rd, ZA-7925 Observatory, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Ataguba, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Hlth Econ Unit, Anzio Rd, ZA-7925 Observatory, South Africa.",John.Ataguba@uct.ac.za,,"Ataguba, John Ele-Ojo/0000-0002-7746-3826",Claude Leon Foundation,Claude Leon Foundation,This work was supported by the Claude Leon Foundation for young researchers.,,60,12,14,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In order to do so, we build an agent-based model of growth and distribution where heterogeneous firms adjust capital accumulation discontinuously because of sunk costs and of market constraints. This economy is characterized by a particular form of path dependency, genuine hysteresis: the most important temporary shocks affect potential output permanently. The results of the simulations implemented show indeed that austerity policies that trigger debt deleveraging, precautionary saving and wage tightening affect negatively the long-run path of the economy. As a matter of consequence, our paper sheds some light on issues that many European countries have been facing since 2008, and puts into question the possibility for most of these countries to reach the pre-crisis rates of growth. The most likely scenario for Europe in the upcoming decades is therefore a chronicle underutilization of fixed productive capacity and labour force. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Catch-up is ascribed to globalised labour markets and the effects of emigration. However current estimates of the level of Irish wages and their rate of growth are based on a small sample of the male workforce. This article presents estimates of the average wage for all wage earners and the Irish wage bill. This enables an estimate of an (implied) British average wage and wage bill. The new estimates show that although there was significant wage catch-up in a few occupations, in general catch-up was less rapid than recent studies have suggested. The origins of this catch-up are also examined. Consistent with earlier studies which emphasise modernisation of the post-Famine economy, the evidence of this article is consistent with the effects of traditional convergence forces such as TFP growth, capital accumulation and structural change operating alongside the effects of emigration.","[Begley, Jason] Coventry Univ, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Coventry University,"Begley, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Business Soc, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England.",jason.begley@coventry.ac.uk,,"Begley, Jason/0000-0001-7240-3560; Stark, Thomas/0000-0003-1059-5047",,,,,21,4,4,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Our empirical strategy exploits time and cross-sectional variation in countries' first adoption of container facilities and combines it with product-level variation in containerizability and container usage. Applying our container variables on a large panel of product level trade flows for the period 1962-1990, our estimates suggest economically large concurrent and cumulative effects of containerization and lend support for the view of containerization being a driver of 20th century economic globalization.

Using data from Mexican labor surveys for the period between 2000 and 2014, we investigate if the decline was driven by wages declining more sharply for younger or older workers. We find that wages of older workers declined and the decline was more pronounced the older the cohort.

We address this question by exploring factors connected to R&D in KIBS, with attention to whether it is connected with internal capabilities or to establishments' openness. We show that KIBS' R&D is associated with internal capabilities, and that recourse to external R&D is part of a strategy of openness that complements internal capacity. We also suggest that KIBS's own view of R&D is aligned with R&D in the good-sproducing sector, leading establishments in non-technological KIBS sectors to under-report R&D.","[Doloreux, David] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Doloreux, David] KEDGE Business Sch, Talence, France; [Shearmur, Richard] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rodriguez, Mercedes] Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Granada, Spain",University of Ottawa; Kedge Business School; McGill University; University of Granada,"Doloreux, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Doloreux, D (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, Talence, France.",doloreux@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Rodríguez, Mercedes/HTL-9989-2023; Doloreux, David/Y-7368-2019; Rodriguez, Mercedes/H-5517-2015","Doloreux, David/0000-0001-7101-2170; Rodriguez, Mercedes/0000-0002-0524-7737",Social Science and Humanities Research Council in Canada [SSHRC 410-2011-0108]; Telfer School of Management (SMRF) at the University of Ottawa,Social Science and Humanities Research Council in Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Telfer School of Management (SMRF) at the University of Ottawa,The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council in Canada [SSHRC 410-2011-0108] and the Telfer School of Management (SMRF research grant) at the University of Ottawa.

The main aim of the paper is to explore which labor market institutions have significant impact on the unemployment rate of older workers. This is analysed in a panel of 17 EU countries for the period 2004-2013. The main results are that active labor market policy measures have a positive impact on the unemployment. This surprising result is probably influenced by recent economic crisis. Secondly, there is negative impact of collective bargaining coverage and EPL on unemployment. There are no significant differences in impact of labor market institutions on unemployment of prime-aged and older workers.","[Franc, Ales] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Franc, A (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ales.franc@mendelu.cz,"Franc, Aleš/V-7039-2018","Franc, Ales/0000-0002-5602-9967",MSMT within the project COST CZ (LD); [LDI 15065],MSMT within the project COST CZ (LD);,This article was written within the project LDI 15065 - Gender dimension of implementation of active ageing in Czech private and public sector and its comparison with western countries.

ERP projects are long lasting and complex activities, influencing the main internal and external operations of organizations. As companies spend an immense investment on these projects, in the beginning managers are focusing on the most common success factors to reach the main goal of a proper implementation. For evaluating ERP projects in retrospective, an applicable measurement of the whole implementation and its economic effects is essential. This research paper evaluates the most prominent ERP project success models mentioned in scientific literature and gives an overview of the different approaches. It explores the best fitting model for measuring ERP project success and based on that analysis, the authors created a new model using empirical data. The study was performed on a sample of medium-sized companies located in Austria and Germany, which implemented ERP software between 2011 and 2013. Based on a newly developed questionnaire completed by over 300 companies' CEOs, factor analysis of the data shows a reduction of dimensions for ERP project success measurement. It indicates that characteristics of success factors can be summoned up to 5 different dimensions, namely project management, user satisfaction, time and budget, ERP system quality and economic value. The results show that some of the dimensions suggested by other authors are coherent and redundant, and, therefore, an extra measurement of these aspects is misleading. The study is designed to make a contribution to management science literature from the perspective of project management requiring effective success evaluation instruments.","[Gollner, Juergen Alexander] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Management Sci, 19 Raina Blvd, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia; [Baumane-Vitolina, Ilona] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, 19 Raina Blvd, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; University of Latvia,"Gollner, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Management Sci, 19 Raina Blvd, LV-1586 Riga, Latvia.",gollner@gmx.at; ilona.baumane@lu.lv,,,,,,,55,7,16,5,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A dichotomous mode choice between greenfield investment and acquisitions forms the basic framework for analysis. The theoretical part contains the application of Dunning's model to the investigated relationships with the said establishment mode choice as well as an overview of the empirical research conducted so far on outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Seven research hypotheses are formulated in this context and tested on a sample of firms registered in Poland with ongoing FDI. Data collection was made using an online survey, then four models were used to test the statistical significance of the hypothesized relationships. The results showed no statistical significance for the hypotheses linking mode choice with ownership and internalization advantages. Positive verification was recorded for all the identified location advantages. Thus Dunning's OLI framework demonstrates the limited applicability to the establishment mode choices in an advanced emerging country context. The study concludes with an outline of its contribution to OFDI research, its limitations and finally with recommendations for future research in this area.","[Gorynia, Marian; Trapczynski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland; [Nowak, Jan] IBD Business Sch, Warsaw, Poland; [Wolniak, Radoslaw] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; University of Warsaw,"Gorynia, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",,"Trąpczyński, Piotr/IQS-2191-2023; Wolniak, Radoslaw/ABA-9722-2020; Gorynia, Marian/P-7786-2018; Wolniak, Radoslaw/P-7146-2017","Trąpczyński, Piotr/0000-0001-8154-9174; Wolniak, Radoslaw/0000-0003-1801-2408; Gorynia, Marian/0000-0002-7633-8249; Wolniak, Radoslaw/0000-0003-0317-9811",Foundation for Polish Science (FNP); National Science Centre [DEC-2012/07/N/HS4/00283],"Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)(Foundation for Polish Science); National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","Dr. Piotr Trqpczypiski is supported by the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP).; The study was financed with the research grant of the National Science Centre, awarded based on the decision no.

The traditional methods, on one hand provide the immediate interaction between the teacher and learner, the online learning however is more comfortable in terms of time scheduling, commuting and other expenses. The disadvantages of contact learning are seen in exposing shy people to public presentation and possible fail. The online methods can also deepen the addiction to computers and prolong the time spent on computer.

Lee's theoretical contribution to institutional-heterodox economics, I make the case that the neoclassical price mechanism is not only flawed, but also irrelevant for the study of actual coordination mechanisms, hence the price mechanism - as a theory as well as a way of thinking - should be discarded. While this position was addressed by early institutionalists, starting with Thorstein Veblen, later institutionalists have not completely rejected the price mechanism. The sympathy for the price mechanism has prevented institutionalists (and other heterodox economists) from fully developing an alternative theoretical framework concerning how actual economic activities are organized. I, therefore, provide an institutionalist-heterodox framework of the provisioning process focusing on business enterprise activities. This framework shows how institutional economics becomes more refined and useful when it is married to other traditions in heterodox economics, in particular, Marxian, social, and post-Keynesian economics. Such an integrative approach is what Fred Lee showed through his work toward producing a better theory and policy for the underlying population.","[Jo, Tae-Hee] State Univ New York Buffalo State, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College,"Jo, TH (通讯作者)，State Univ New York Buffalo State, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY USA.",,"Jo, Tae-Hee/A-7828-2018","Jo, Tae-Hee/0000-0002-0242-024X",,,,,77,10,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Some studies use changes in exchange rate to indicate exchange rate risks relevant to firm value. However, a different measure of exchange rate risks, which is the volatility in exchange rate changes, can also affect the value of firms because exchange rate uncertainty can affect international trade and investments of firms. This study classifies exchange rate risks into two types, namely, changes in exchange rate and the standard deviation of exchange rate changes, and empirically examines exchange rate exposure of firms in 12 countries. The results suggest that the proportion of firms with significant exchange rate exposure increases substantially, and thus, weakens the exchange rate exposure puzzle when we also count the cases in which the standard deviation of exchange rate changes affects stock return significantly.","[Kang, Sammo] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Phil Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 100715, South Korea; [Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, San 56-1, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong Wook] Bank Korea, 110,3 Ga, Seoul 100715, South Korea",Dongguk University; Seoul National University (SNU); Bank of Korea,"Kang, S (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Phil Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 100715, South Korea.",sammokang@dongguk.edu,,,,,,,26,3,6,10,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This situation is caused mainly by accelerating globalization which has significant impact on development of international commerce not only as whole but also in terms of supranational regions. The European Union is representative example of such a region. There are a lot of benefits of entering into foreign markets, almost in times of hyper competitiveness and global customer creation. But there is not only bright side of cross border commerce intensification. Many companies are sceptic when entry into foreign market is discussing. Main fears and practical problems are resulting from existing legal uncertainty and inconsistency of obligation and bankruptcy law. The first one is important when contracts are not fulfilled at appropriate level while the second one is vital from the company's point of view when the partner is bankrupt and there are still obligations to be fulfilled without optimistic prospective to be done so and with threat of so called forum shipping i.e. manipulation with territorial jurisdiction in order to obtain greater benefits and to weaken the procedural position and rights of the other party, which is the creditor in most cases. This is the reason for the acceleration of activities leading to harmonization of bankruptcy law in the context of the European Union. But which are the challenges of this legislative activity in terms of globalization? Will be member states willing to abandon their legal culture and accept single European Union bankruptcy law without taking into account existing national specifics and competences? These are the questions which we try to answer using analysis of convergences and divergences of national bankruptcy laws as a prospective base for single bankruptcy law creation.","[Kliestikova, Jana; Misankova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kliestikova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",jana.kliestikova@fpedas.uniza.sk; maria.misankova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Majerova, Jana/N-8126-2015; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015","Kovacova, Maria/0000-0003-2081-6835",science project: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies [APVV-14-0841],science project: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies,This paper is an output of the science project APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies.,,25,6,6,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,914,921,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800114,0

In particular, how do survey expectations change the role of persistence of inflation and output (i.e. coefficients of the corresponding lagged terms)? Survey data are modeled in several different ways, to facilitate an analysis of different relationships with rational expectations. The model is estimated by means of a Bayesian estimator from quarterly euro area data using both aggregated and micro level data from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for 1999Q1-2012Q3. The broad finding is that the use of measured expectations produces more economically meaningful results than does the standard use of model-consistent rational expectations. In particular, survey expectations also reduce the relative weights of the lagged dependent variables in the Phillips curve and the IS curve. All this shows up in impulse responses that turn out to be quite different suggesting that measured expectations are not only proxies of rational expectations. By contrast, measured expectations are related to rational expectations with a way that may well reflect different adjustment and learning processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, if the adjustment cost is high enough, at least one firm decides not to adjust at the pure-strategy equilibrium, and such a partial adjustment by the industry can be socially efficient as well.

In line with it, the purpose of this paper is to explore whether conditional correlations can be a new signal to predict recessions. Furthermore, this paper also tries to investigate among the four factors-the time difference of the beginning and the end of recessions, financial integration (FI), and trade integration (TI)-which factors drive the direction of change in conditional correlations. Finally, this paper is to explain the implication for Korea trade. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a probit regression model for 33 country during the period from 1972 to 2015. To measure the time-varying interest rates conditional correlations, a VAR(1)-DBEKK-GARCH(1,1) model is adopted due to its statistical advantages. Furthermore, the authors also construct the four measures-time difference of the beginning of recessions (BEG), time difference of the end of recessions (END), FI, and TI. The authors first study the predictive power of correlations in both in and out-samples test, and study which factors determine the different behavior of interest rate co-movements using the four measures. Findings - The empirical results show that the conditional correlations between the long-term interest rates of the USA and individual countries contain information about recessions a few quarters ahead which term spreads of neither individual countries nor the USA conveyed in. However, there is a heterogeneity of the significance and direction of interest rate correlations. A further research reveals that especially the heterogeneous degree of TI leads to the different overlapped recession period of individual countries with the USA, resulting in heterogeneous behavior of interest rates among countries. Research limitations/implications - As a limitation of this paper, the forecasting power of interest rate correlations is not always significant in all countries. Despite this, the study has a profound implication that for those countries where the US accounts for the high proportion of trade, increase in conditional correlations can be a signal for future recessions. Especially, given a considerable portion of trade in GDP and the more sensitive trade activity of Korea to a contagious recession than a domestic recession, the conditional correlation measure is particularly useful for Korean policy makers. Originality/value - Although many papers model interest rate co-movement as a function of macroeconomic condition, this paper provides the first evidence to show interest rate co-movement precede the macro shocks empirically. Furthermore, this paper determines the precise channel through which TI affects the time-varying behavior of interest rate co-movements before recessions.","[Lee, Ki-Ryoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Jo, Chan-Ik] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kim, Hyung-Geun] Silla Univ, Busan, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; University of Toronto; Silla University,"Jo, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",chanik.jo15@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We empirically challenge this economic and social promise in an attempt to prove its fulfilment. Our multivariate regressions of economic development variables such as per capita gross national income based on PPP converted to international dollars (GNI per capita PPP), GDP growth, as well as gross capital formation and labour participation rate against specific microfinance institutions' (MFI) variables show that the success and performance of MFIs significantly influence economic development. Microfinance directly influences economic growth through the value that MFI performance adds to purchasing power. An indirect impact comes from an improvement in capital accumulation and employment rates. These insights are valuable as the interdependencies between microfinance and economic development that this article verifies offer new and progressive insights into purposeful action that can be taken to stimulate economic development and growth. Targeted development programmes as well as socially responsible investments can be applied in developing economies in order to strengthen their growth and alleviate poverty.","[Lopatta, K.; Tchikov, M.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Accounting & Corp Governance, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Tchikov, M (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Accounting & Corp Governance, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",magdalena.tchikov@uni-oldenburg.de,,"Lopatta, Kerstin/0000-0003-0267-0588",,,,,60,19,21,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Prior research showed that auditor industry specialization is positively associated with audit quality, suggesting that industry knowledge improves audit risk assessment and audit-planning decisions. In other words, audit firms that are industry specialists invest time and financial resources in developing personnel and technology in specific industries to improve audit quality. Moreover, auditors that invest in gaining specific industry expertise and have larger market shares in a certain industry are able to split the knowledge-developing costs and achieve economies of scale. The aim of this paper is to investigate if industry specialization among audit firms exists in Croatia or audit firms adopt a different approach, providing services to a wide range of clients and gaining general audit knowledge. The research was conducted on a population of companies in Croatia that were the subject of statutory audit in the year 2014. Industry specialists were determined using the within-industry market share approach, in which an auditor is considered to be industry specialist if it has a significant market share (20% or more) in the industry, based on the total revenue of its clients. According to the research results, we identified six audit firms as industry specialists, which include all Big Four audit firms, as it was expected. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are signs of industry specialization of large audit firms in Croatia.","[Malis, Sanja Sever; Brozovic, Mateja] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Malis, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ssever@efzg.hr; mbrozovic@efzg.hr,"Sever Malis, Sanja/H-7908-2018; Brozovic, Mateja/H-7897-2018","Sever Malis, Sanja/0000-0002-7224-9505; Brozovic, Mateja/0000-0001-7338-7494",,,,,30,0,0,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,534,542,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600054,0

As the environmental tax improves the health-profile over the life-cycle, it influences saving, investment in health, labor supply and retirement. As a result, we identify effects of environmental taxation beyond the standard crowding-out and productivity effects captured by the past literature. We show that whether those effects are positive or negative for the economy crucially depends on the degree of substitutability between young and old labor. Our numerical examples suggest that that those new effects alleviate the negative effects of environmental taxation on output and decrease potential positive welfare effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Realization of economic interests in the process of globalization is connected with formation of economic and informational space, which provides income maximization to participants of the international economic relations. Realization consists in formation of institutions which guarantee such maximization. The order in the world was created mostly in accordance with interests of the members of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and the Group of 7 Industrialized Nations. Formation of such organizations as BRICS by frontier countries is a demonstration of institutional interest in order to change the world institutional order. Transition to a format of the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors is also connected with institutional interests in the global economy. Contradictions between interstate associations (in particular in the EU because of migrant policy) arise owing to existence of institutions which conflict with economic interests of the members. Integration of the CIS countries fails due to aspiration to consolidate economic interests, while it needs the creation of institutions of united area. Research of interaction and contradictions of economic and institutional interests is an important aspect of formation of the global economy.","[Mikhailov, Alexander Mikhailovich; Khansevyarov, Rustam Idrisovich; Yakovlevich, Vishnever Vadim] Samara State Univ Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Sovetskoi Armii St 141, Samara 443090, Russia",,"Mikhailov, AM; Khansevyarov, RI; Yakovlevich, VV (通讯作者)，Samara State Univ Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Sovetskoi Armii St 141, Samara 443090, Russia.",2427994@mail.ru; rust@mail.ru; ab3535@mail.ru,"Khansevyarov, Rustam/K-5513-2017; Vishnever, Vadim/ABF-4395-2020; Mikhailov, Alexander/G-2292-2017","Khansevyarov, Rustam/0000-0002-8601-9401; Mikhailov, Alexander/0000-0003-3359-9286",,,,,20,2,2,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1378,1384,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800170,0

Inflation, currency devaluation and a wide gross domestic product (GDP) cycle have been recurrent problems in Argentina for several decades. The literature has extensively discussed those issues from different viewpoints. This study focuses on a relatively unexplored theme that may contribute to a partial explanation. It deals with the continuous tendency to equalize different profitabilities resulting, in turn, from remarkably different sectoral purchasing power parities. Thus, for any given exchange rate, an incessant tendency toward the equalization of profitabilities generates opposing inflationary and devaluatory pressures. The resulting inflation-devaluation cycle feeds income redistribution, GDP fluctuation, real exchange rate instability, and high levels of uncertainty.","[Nicolini-Llosa, Jose Luis] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Nicolini-Llosa, Jose Luis] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Nicolini-Llosa, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Nicolini-Llosa, JL (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

A techno-economic analysis is adopted, which quantifies the economic impacts on different stakeholders including electricity producers, consumers, and network investors, under the future de-carbonisation pathways described in the IRENE-40 scenarios, ranging from 2010 to 2050. To quantify the impact of transmission infrastructure development, for each pathway, two distinct scenarios of future European transmission development are assessed: low (no new transmission between 2010 and 2050) and high (optimal transmission development between 2010 and 2050 to accommodate the generation pathway). The geographical scope of the analysis covers the EU 27+2 nations. A detailed case study of Spain and France is presented to illustrate the so-called 'asymmetric' impacts towards different stakeholders in different importing and exporting zones.

Such theory mainly concerns national or supra-national level decisions. Aim is to propose algorithm of similar decisions locally, taking into account individual specific of local situation. Methods of policy analysis for this aim are applied. Local governments have dual nature - they are executors of national policy as well as autonomous policy-makers and executors of own policy. General principles, formally recognised by all members of the Council of Europe (this concerns also 100% of the EU countries) are: 1) for dividing of competences among national and local authorities - the principle of subsidiarity; 2) for scope and content of intervention - principle of proportionality. The same principles could be applied for decisions about liberalisation or intervention of local issues, which concerns obligatory or voluntary local governments' competences. Factors, which has to be taken into account to decide about intervention, are presence or absence of several types of local market failure and several types of government failure. Proposed algorithm of decision includes testing of sustainability of private activities, testing of main types of market failures, EU failure, national government failure, local government failure. That first cycle of procedure is practical implementation of the principle of subsidiarity. If intervention is necessary, then there are several options, how to impact on situation. The choice could be done among 1) regulation of private activities with corresponding administration; 2) supplying of public services for free; 3) supplying services or goods for partial payments of beneficiaries; 4) direct entrepreneurship; 5) facilitating private entrepreneurs or organised civil society organisations; 6) outsourcing of corresponding local government activities.

It aims to show that the misunderstanding of the mainstream theoretical thinking underlying monetary policy actions led to the ineffectiveness of the policy response to the 2007-8 global financial crisis. The conventional view that monetary policy is the stabilization tool has serious flaws and is ineffective for bringing about economic recovery. The Federal Reserve's experiment with the so-called unconventional monetary policy exposed the weakness of the conventional belief in understanding how banks operate, how the monetary authority can influence the yield curve, and how the monetary transmission mechanism works, resulting in prescribing an ineffective treatment to boost economic activity. In this regard, it is argued that the Federal Reserve's decision to let long-term interest rates be market determined represents a significant self-imposed constraint, which limits policy options regarding monetary policy actions and the effective control of long-term interest rates. By limiting the setting of policy rates only to the overnight interest rate, the ability of the monetary authority to influence long-term interest rates is both weak and indirect.","[Rezende, Felipe] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Rezende, Felipe] Inst Multidisciplinary Dev & Strategy MINDS, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Rezende, F (通讯作者)，Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.;Rezende, F (通讯作者)，Inst Multidisciplinary Dev & Strategy MINDS, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,,,,,,,84,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The results based on Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) estimation showed that FDI inflows have led towards higher growth, lower income inequality and better environmental quality in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the study found that TO has led towards higher economic growth, worsening environmental quality, but no significant effect on income distribution. As for FD, it was found that it has a positive impact on growth and income equality but leads to negative impact on environmental quality. The outcome of this study reveals that only FDI has the potential to be the driver for SD in Indonesia while the other two variables, TO and FD have appropriately influenced at least one out of three pillars of SD. Thus, it is important for the policy makers to improve their existing policies to attract more FDIs in order to ensure that the country's SD goal is attainable.","[Ridzuan, Abdul Rahim] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Ismail, Nor Asmat; Hamat, Abdul Fatah Che] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Ridzuan, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",aimaz84@yahoo.com,"Ridzuan, Associate Professor Dr Abdul Rahim/K-4788-2019; RIDZUAN, ABDUL RAHIM/ACK-3067-2022","Ridzuan, Associate Professor Dr Abdul Rahim/0000-0002-1510-895X; RIDZUAN, ABDUL RAHIM/0000-0002-1510-895X","School of Social Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia","School of Social Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia)","We wish to extend our gratitude to the School of Social Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia for sponsoring the conference fees for this paper.",,19,1,1,0,2,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-11473-6-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,47,55,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000449461100007,0

Europe-wide, crisis' management from public bodies has contributed to worsen weaknesses of European economies, hence making impossible to reduce debt and deficit levels.

Instead, it might be considered that it is an excuse to culminate the project started in the 1980s seeking to maximize economic liberalism as well advance in a broad-based privatization of public services. Indeed, management of successive crises seems oriented to impose a new competitive framework driven by wage contention, growing de-regulation of labor market, precarious labor relationship and dismantlement of core elements of social European heritage. Questioning Public legitimacy as an actor in society has not only a relevant component of conservative foundations from 1980s but it also results in counterproductive economic outcomes generating inequality and soft growth prospects as it has been observed in the eurozone.

The overall efficiency scores of IPO firms are dismal as the percentage of optimum level of IPO firm's remained between 5 to 20 percent in all three stages in pre and post IPOs. In the analysis of broader categories of sectors: private, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), manufacturing, financial and other services sectors, the results of DEA model in three stages suggest that all the sectors were neither found to be Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) efficient nor Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) efficient in pre and post IPOs. Even the efficiency scores decreased in post IPO after one year. However, in detail sector-wise analysis, only Oil and Gas sector showed optimal level under VRS in stage 2. Also, SOEs showed slightly better efficiency than private IPO firms. On average, declining trends in total productivity growth of IPOs after the three years period were observed. The overall results suggest that, after acquiring additional resources, IPO firms did not show improved efficiency level and productivity growth after the period of three years of IPOs.","[Sohail, Muhammad Khalid; Anjum, Muhammad S.] Capital Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad Expressway,Kahuta Rd,Zone 5, Islamabad, Pakistan",Capital University of Science & Technology,"Sohail, MK (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad Expressway,Kahuta Rd,Zone 5, Islamabad, Pakistan.",khalid_sohail@comsats.edu.pk; anjum@cust.edu.pk,,,,,,,41,0,1,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Secondly, if the business plan is leaned on the past business, which was good, it does not mean it will be as good in the future. Next problem is concerning applied discount rate. There are many methods to calculate one, but each one is optional and arbitrary, what means it is up to analyst or valuator to choose one. Residual value problem occurs now. Putting this value into the calculation the whole picture can be heavily distorted, especially if the sum of net incomes is not very high. Proposed Compounded Cash Flow or CCF method offers a different approach to valuation. Instead of bringing back the future promises to the present by arbitrary chosen discount rate, this method proposes to take company's complete financial reports and by taking stated figures bringing the certain and reliable past to the present by compounding. Knowing the past (inflation rate, taxes, banking rates, demand, costs, accounting policies, etc.) data from the accounting books can be corrected and adjusted properly. This way more reliable and accurate data are available to be evaluated. The CCF method is theoretically well founded, applicable in practice and it serves for valuating any business. By this method the company's value can be estimated (valuated) at the certain part of time and compared to the current stock price on the stock market, and the additional advantage of this method is risk elimination of misevaluating for the certain extend. Following previously disclosed the paper points out the necessity of evaluating, not only physical assets, but also human capital, i.e., the totality of knowledge and skills of employees in company. The paper points to the fact that the use of CCF method takes into account the human capital as an important component significantly reduced chronic devastation of the eastern Croatian economy.","[Speranda, Ivo] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia; [Piplica, Damir] Univ Dept Profess Studies Split, Kopilica 5, Split, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik; University of Split,"Speranda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",ivo.speranda@unidu.hr; damir.piplica@gmail.com,"Piplica, Damir/ABF-4587-2020",,,,,,12,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,327,337,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600032,0

Part of this choice complexity is the result of deliberate obfuscation by firms. This review synthesizes a theoretical literature that analyzes the role of choice complexity in otherwise competitive markets. I identify two general classes of market models in the literature: (a) The obfuscation strategy of firms is an independent framing device that affects the probability with which consumers make correct comparisons, and (b) market alternatives are multiattribute objects, and obfuscation is captured by lopsided location in attribute space, lowering the probability of being dominated by another market alternative. I address the following key questions: What determines the amount of choice complexity in market equilibrium? What is the relation between choice complexity and payoff-relevant aspects of the market outcome? What is the role of consumer protection measures? The models surveyed in this review suggest that equilibrium obfuscation and choice complexity increase in response to intensified competition, mitigating the positive effect of competition on consumer welfare. However, equilibrium effects can also attenuate the positive welfare effects of regulatory interventions.","[Spiegler, Ran] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Econ, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Spiegler, Ran] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Spiegler, Ran] Ctr Macroecon, London WC2A 2AE, England",Tel Aviv University; University of London; University College London,"Spiegler, R (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Econ, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.;Spiegler, R (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.;Spiegler, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Macroecon, London WC2A 2AE, England.",rani@post.tau.ac.il,,,ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,54,25,27,4,26,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4608-9,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The EU has again set itself the target to advance the Single Market. Services are one of the priorities in a new strategy and thus it is important to analyse the present situation regarding barriers that obstacle the effective functioning of the Single Market for services.

The richness of the data allowed us to use propensity score matching in order to rule out possible selectivity issues.

One of the most visible changes is the effort of women to more equally participate in a global work environment, to achieve economic independence and to penetrate the middle and senior management. Despite the fact that the status of women in society around the world has changed compared to the past women still face various forms of discrimination. For example, in many countries women do not reach the same level of education as men do, they are not equally remunerated for the same work compared to men. Furthermore, the share of women in the top management position is still on a low level. To eliminate these types of discrimination and to enhance the number of women in top management the European Commission has recently submitted proposals for legally binding quotas for women on corporate boards of European companies. The goal of this scientific paper is to highlight the importance of women participation in top management in global work environment, to point out not only the selected barriers women are facing in their effort to reach top-management position but also to show the benefits that women can bring to the company.","[Sulikova, Rozalia; Strazovska, Lubomira] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Sulikova, R; Strazovska, L (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",rozalia.sulikova@fm.uniba.sk; lubomira.strazovska@uniba.sk,"Strazovska, Lubomira/AAH-1664-2019; Hearn, Jeff/R-6613-2019; Sulikova, Rozalia/AAA-5166-2020","Strazovska, Lubomira/0000-0002-7631-1193; Hearn, Jeff/0000-0002-9808-1413; Sulikova, Rozalia/0000-0002-0543-3636",,,,,23,10,10,1,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2167,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800269,0

We rely on the salience of a new ethanol plant in a farmers' local neighbourhood to identify the impact of the RFS mandate on these spatially advantaged farms. To control for the nonrandom selection of ethanol production facilities, we utilize a propensity score matching estimator, and to remove impact of farm-level or market shifting unobservables resulting from shifts in commodity prices we employ a difference-in-difference (DD) matching approach. We estimate the treatment effect of an ethanol production facility on farm size prior to the RFS mandate and after the RFS programme. The effect of the RFS policy on farm size is obtained as the difference between these two DD matching estimators. Overall, our results suggest that the RFS programme raised the probability of farm size increase by roughly 12-18%, on average, for farms located within a 30-mile radius of new ethanol plants. In addition, the programme contributed to a net increase in farm size of 25-32%, on average, for those spatially advantaged farms.","[Tra, Constant I.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Towe, Charles A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; University of Connecticut,"Tra, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",constant.tra@unlv.edu,,,USDA Cooperative [58-6000-8-0084],USDA Cooperative,Constant Tra acknowledges funding from USDA Cooperative [grant number 58-6000-8-0084].,,13,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical findings suggest that China establish an early-warning mechanism and trade assistance system, so that key industries that were damaged could be properly compensated.","[Wu, Xianhua; Wang, Yingying; Yang, Lingjuan; Guo, Ji] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Climate & Weather Disasters Collaborat Innovat Ct, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Song, Shunfeng] Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Song, Shunfeng] Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wei, Guo] Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Pembroke, NC USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Tianjin Chengjian University; University of North Carolina,"Wu, XH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Climate & Weather Disasters Collaborat Innovat Ct, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wxh77nuist@126.com,", 吴老师/AAW-9978-2020; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; wang, yingying/GRS-3058-2022; wang, yan/JBJ-7462-2023; Wu, Xian/IXN-6929-2023; wang, ying/GQY-5077-2022; wang, yingying/JCE-4984-2023","Wu, Xian/0000-0001-8816-981X; wu, xianhua/0000-0001-6659-2262","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373131, 71140014, 71410307025, 11371292]; National Social and Scientific Fund Program [11CGL100]; National Soft Scientific Fund Program [2011GXQ4B025]; National Industry-specific Topics [GYHY200806017]; Tianjin Higher Education Innovation Team Program [TD12-5063]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of MOE [2013-693]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social and Scientific Fund Program; National Soft Scientific Fund Program; National Industry-specific Topics; Tianjin Higher Education Innovation Team Program; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of MOE(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373131], [71140014], [71410307025], [11371292]; National Social and Scientific Fund Program [11CGL100]; National Soft Scientific Fund Program [2011GXQ4B025]; National Industry-specific Topics [GYHY200806017]; Tianjin Higher Education Innovation Team Program [No. TD12-5063, Shunfeng Song]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of MOE [No.2013-693, Ji Guo].

It is important to evaluate the potential influence of RMB internationalization on China 's macroeconomy. In the present study, a framework that includes monetary supply and demand was created to analyze the influences of RMB cross-border settlement on China 's domestic interest rate, asset price and foreign exchange reserves. It is found that RMB settlement in different BOP items leads to very different effects on China's real economy and the financial market. Based on the analysis, we provide a framework of the policy priorities for RMB internationalization, with the RMB cross-border settlement items divided into three groups with different priorities. Meanwhile, to support RMB internationalization, exchange rate reforms should be adopted as a priority and a prudent attitude maintained regarding capital account liberalization.","[Xu, Qiyuan] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Fan] Inst New Econ Thinking, Caixin Insight Grp, New York, NY USA; [He, Fan] Inst New Econ Thinking, New York, NY 10010 USA",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Xu, QY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, F (通讯作者)，Inst New Econ Thinking, Caixin Insight Grp, New York, NY USA.;He, F (通讯作者)，Inst New Econ Thinking, New York, NY 10010 USA.",xuqy@cass.org.cn; hefancass@vip.sina.com,,,National Social Science Foundation [13AJL008]; National Natural Science Foundation [71503263],National Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 13AJL008) and the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71503263).,,15,2,2,0,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2016,24.0,1,,,,,104,122,,10.1111/cwe.12146,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001200006,0

This was and continues to be one of the reasons we began to research the mutual interaction of the analytical structures of theoretical physics and economics. In this paper we implemented the basic theoretical construction of three-dimensional vector theory of retail gravitation on a geoid through the definition of the scalar potential in an inertial system of coordinates. This means that we describe the course of economic processes in space and time with respect to the cosmic space near Earth (i.e. in Space Economics) under the assumption that non-satiation axiom is general economic axiom which is associated with the genetic essence of life existing in any part of the Universe. A vector field of retail gravitation intensity is defined as one representable in the form of the negative gradient of a scalar field. The components of retail gravitation intensity are supposed to be continuously differentiable and the domain in which the vector field is considered is simply connected. A major empirical finding of the nationwide three-year study of retail dynamics is that retail business is attracted from smaller cities and towns to larger cities according to a law with an analytical structure nearly identical to that of Newton's law of gravitation. This empirical finding is derived directly by methods of theoretical physics from the Newton's law of gravitation.,"[Zeithamer, Tomas R.] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zeithamer, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800, Czech Republic.",zeithamer.tomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2482,2489,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800308,0

We test the assumption that spatial concentration of services with symbolic knowledge-base into the largest metropolitan region is higher than in case of services with analytical and synthetic knowledge-base. Combination of high transaction costs and necessity of face-to-face communication with suppliers and clients is the primary reason for over-representation of services with symbolic knowledge-base in metropolitan regions. Spatial concentration of service employment is measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index and also by the share of (non)metropolitan regions in total employment in Czechia. Metropolitan regions are further divided into urban cores and commuting hinterlands in order to evaluate indirectly the effects of commercial suburbanization. Not surprisingly, services with symbolic knowledge-base exhibited the highest level of spatial concentration into the metropolitan regions with an exclusive position of the capital city Prague. On the other hand, services with synthetic knowledge-base showed more dispersed localisation pattern and significantly higher share of employment located in non-metropolitan regions. Therefore, knowledge-bases really matter for the spatial distribution of services in Czechia.","[Zenka, Jan; Slach, Ondrej; Reichova, Vendula] Univ Ostrava, Dep Human Geog & Reg Dev, Fac Nat Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Zenka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Dep Human Geog & Reg Dev, Fac Nat Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",jan.zenka@osu.cz; ondrej.slach@osu.cz; p14153@student.osu.cz,"Ženka, Jan/AAJ-5648-2021",,,,,,13,2,2,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,522,528,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-67,0.0,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500068,0

These findings indicate that financial system risk tolerance capacity, which provides a powerful trial and error system, has a positive effect on long-term growth.

This paper establishes an open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with two economies: China and the rest of the world. To assess the effects of oil price shocks, the CES production function is extended by adding oil as an input. Based on the model, the effects of four types of oil price fluctuations are evaluated. The four types of oil price shocks are supply shocks driven by political events in OPEC countries, other oil supply shocks, aggregate shocks to the demand for industrial commodities, and demand shocks that are specific to the crude oil market. Simulation results indicate the following: Oil supply shocks driven by political events mainly produce short-term effects on China's output and inflation, while the other three shocks produce relatively long-term effects; in addition, demand shocks that are specific to the crude oil market contribute the most to the fluctuations in China's output and inflation.

Like the preference for local in food consumption decisions, an individual may be motivated to support the local community by participating with investment capital. This paper draws on the phenomenon of home bias in financial decisions and hypothesizes that familiarity with agricultural production generates a positive attitude towards investing in the domestic food chain. Using a dispersed sample of 845 financial market professionals, we find that locational effects and social proximity contribute to self-categorized rural identity and bonding. Individuals who identify themselves as rural are more positively disposed to investing in firms that operate in the food chain. Consumption preference for domestically produced food and preference for maintaining the vitality of rural areas increase the probability of perceiving food production as attractive investment. The evidence reconciles with the familiarity and patriotism hypotheses. The findings are relevant for agricultural producer firms that seek outside equity and may prove useful for effective marketing of financial products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Danish economy has experienced a boom-bust pattern ending with a large drop in GDP and thus labour demand. So far, the flexicurity model has coped with the Great Recession in the sense that gross flows in the labour market remain high, most unemployment spells are short, and there are no strong indications of increases in long-term unemployment. There are thus no signs that the large and prolonged aggregate demand shock is causing an increase in structural unemployment.

In addition to the size of the matrix, estimation of correlation is also complicated by the fact that defaults are rare and credit-sensitive securities such as stocks, bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) are noisy. Therefore, we present in this paper an estimation approach based on credit-sensitive instruments that accounts for noise and is highly parallelizable, the latter being a very important feature for large portfolios in finance. A simulation study shows that the method is reliable and has better statistical properties when benchmarked against other correlation estimators. In an empirical study based on the CDS premiums and stock prices of 225 firms listed on the CDX North American indices, we analyze the correlations computed using numerous approaches. Overall, we find that ignoring noise severely underestimates correlations, whereas equity correlation is poorly related to the best correlation estimates inferred from the CDS market.

These databases differ considerably in purpose, coverage, data sources, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and quality of documentation. This special issue reviews and compares eight such databases. Five are microdata-based: CEPALSTAT, Income Distribution Database (IDD), LIS, PovcalNet, and Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC); two are based on secondary sources: All the Ginis (ATG) and the World Income Inequality Database (WIID); and one is generated entirely through multiple-imputation methods: the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). Although there is much agreement across these databases, there is also a non-trivial share of country/year cells for which substantial discrepancies exist. In some cases, different databases would lead users to radically different conclusions about inequality dynamics in certain countries and periods. The methodological differences that lead to these discrepancies often appear to be driven by a fundamental trade-off between a wish for broader coverage on the one hand, and for greater comparability on the other. These differences across databases place considerable responsibility on both producers and users: on the former, to better document and explain their assumptions and procedures, and on the latter, to understand the data they are using, rather than merely taking it as true because available.","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

We draw a distinction between the goods market frictions that are required to consume tradable goods (e.g., distribution costs) and those that are necessary for international transactions (e.g., trade costs). We find that trade costs generate LOP deviations by introducing a no-arbitrage band, while distribution costs cause the price to deviate from the LOP by affecting the probability that trade will occur, given the band. We then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to show that real exchange rate volatility is positively associated with trade costs, but negatively related to distribution costs. This effect depends on the interplay of trade costs and distribution costs, as they work in opposite directions when creating arbitrage opportunities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the empirical literature has had difficulty proving a basic tenet, namely that an agent has more success when the agent uses a signal. This paper provides evidence based on a field experiment in an online dating market. Participants are randomly endowed with two or eight virtual roses that a participant can use for free to signal special interest when asking for a date. Our results show that, by sending a rose, a person can substantially increase the chance of the offer being accepted, and this positive effect is neither because the rose attracts attention from recipients nor because the rose is associated with unobserved quality. Furthermore, we find evidence that roses increase the total number of dates, instead of crowding out offers without roses attached. Despite the positive effect of sending roses, a substantial fraction of participants do not fully utilize their endowment of roses and even those who exhaust their endowment on average do not properly use their roses to maximize their dating success.","[Lee, Soohyung] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Niederle, Muriel] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Stanford University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",LeeS@econ.umd.edu,"Niederle, Muriel/F-2613-2011",,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Woongjin Lee, Hye-Rim Kim and Woo-Keum Kim from the Korea Marriage Culture Institute for help running the experiment and Benjamin Malin and Alvin Roth for detailed comments.

Scenario results reveal how climate policy and inter-firm learning spillovers interact with market structure to affect wind and solar PV prices, adoption, producer profits, and carbon emissions. Competitive markets yield consistently lower markups than concentrated markets, leading to significantly more adoption and lower emissions. Widespread solar PV adoption is a key component of the largest emissions reductions, but this requires substantial price reductions that only occur if the solar PV market is competitive and learning spills over across producers. Whether a leading firm has a profit incentive to facilitate or obstruct learning spillovers depends on the availability of cost-competitive substitute technologies. If such a substitute exists, the firm prefers strong spillovers that help its industry compete against the substitute; if not, the firm prefers weak spillovers that prevent competitors in its industry from seizing market share. The relationship between price and cumulative capacity is endogenous in the modeling framework. Regression analysis of scenario results yields price learning rates which are similar to unit production cost learning rates in competitive markets, but substantially lower - even negative - in concentrated markets.

The dynamic MRS-Copula models consist of the marginal model and dynamic MRS Rotated-Gumbel function, and they are examined by the goodness-of-fit test method. Using the dynamic MRS-Copula models, we calculate the daily lower tail dependency by adopting the international stock market index data from January 1997 to June 2015, and provide evidence of financial risk contagion effects between Chinese stock market and other international stock markets after the reform of the RMB exchange rate system in China, and this is particular the case after in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis and the European debt crisis. When conducting robust tests with weekly and monthly data, the empirical result basically holds. As for the financial risk contagion channels in Chinese stock market, the fundamental economic linkages play a more important role than liquidity, information and other factors.

Such an evidence is not found for manufacturing and aggregate productivity, for which long run distribution dynamics are characterized by bimodality. The decomposition of the growth rate of aggregate labour productivity reveals that pure productivity gains drive growth. Structural change plays a minor role in the process, however it halves the contribution of the manufacturing sector for the richest regions, while it enhances the weight of financial market services.

Our results show that technological breakthroughs cause a productivity slowdown and a drop in the stock prices of existing firms; these findings are consistent with observations in the 1970s. We explain how technological breakthroughs cause these phenomena. The emergence of a new technology creates new business opportunities, which reduces existing firms' profits, thus causing their stock prices to drop. This decline in existing firms' profits discourages R&D-intensive firms from entering the sector; this decreases aggregate R&D activity, and thus the growth rate of productivity declines.

Ties between the onshore and offshore markets were closest before the first band widening and steadily loosened thereafter. We further study the cointegration and lead-lag effects between offshore and onshore spot and forward markets and show that there is a longterm equilibrium relationship between any pair of them.

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of Brazilian household consumption on the CO2 emissions for 2003 and 2009 using input-output tables from the World Input-Output Database. We used a semi-closed model with eight household groups in order to apply the hypothetical extraction method in the consumption structure of each group. Further, we use the result from the hypothetical extraction to evaluate the impacts of the structure consumption of each household group in terms of CO2 emissions. We find that there is a trade-off between the households' greater satisfaction from consumption and the increasing setback in emissions from the restructuring and modification of the consumption basket. Thus, this study contributes to the research on emissions by mapping the recent behavior of the Brazilian economy in terms of increased income, changes in the consumption structure, and their impacts on emissions. The paper's aggregated results by income and consumption structure based on the intensity of the emissions and their systemic effects add to the discussions on less-polluting production processes, more conscious consumption of goods, and more rational uses of energy and transportation.

In this regard, we investigate the transmission of several eurozone shocks (output gap, money market rates and inflation) on various macroeconomic variables in the aforementioned countries (output, inflation, money market rates and budget deficits). We trace the effects of foreign shocks on the basis of impulse response functions obtained from the Bayesian Vector Auto Regressions (VARs) separately for each country. The main findings from our study are: first, economic expansion in the eurozone has strong output and inflation effects on SEE economies, implying some degree of synchronization of business cycles; second, eurozone inflation is instantly and to a great extent transmitted to domestic inflation, suggesting that inflation in the SEE economies is mostly driven by foreign inflation; third, domestic money market rates are not closely linked with eurozone money markets; fourth, monetary policy in the SEE countries does not seem to be responsive to eurozone inflation shocks; and fifth, the fiscal authorities attempt to offset the spillover effects from both economic expansion and monetary tightening in the eurozone.

We demonstrate that regret aversion can cause investors to ride a bubble, exit and reenter the market, or choose not to trade. Further, herds and partial herds can occur in the market, and we show that the stronger regret over inaction, the easier it is for herds to occur. The model presented herein also predicts that during the formation of a bubble (crash), bearish (bullish) traders tend to exit and reenter the market, thereby causing a positive (negative) correlation between order volume and order imbalance.

COOPER; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY,"A green image is recently an important component of corporate sustainability in modern business. By extending the two previous works (i.e., Wang et al., 2014; Sueyoshi and Wang, 2014a), this study discusses a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment by incorporating an analytical capability to handle zero and/or negative in a data set. The proposed approach provides us with not only new quantitative assessment on unified (operational and environmental) performance of firms but also information regarding how to invest for eco-technology innovation for abating an amount of their industrial pollutions. According to the previous studies, the energy industry is an attractive investment target if desirable outputs are measured by Return on Assets (ROA) as a short-term concern and an amount of CO2 emission reduction. The selection on a desirable output combination is important in understanding the corporate sustainability of the energy industry because it is the largest emitter among seven industry sectors examined in the previous studies. However, if the ROA is replaced by a corporate value, measured by Tobin's q ratio as a long-term concern, the energy industry is not so attractive because it uses a very large production process so that green investment does not immediately increase the corporate value. An empirical problem of these previous studies is that they have investigated only successful companies with positive ROA or Tobin's q ratios. The analytical feature clearly indicates a methodological drawback of their studies. In contrast, this study pays attention to both successful companies with positive net incomes and unsuccessful companies with negative net incomes, so being able to measure all aspects of their performance in a short-term concern. This study finds that the energy industry exhibits a high level of potential on green investment. However, the energy industry may be not attractive even in the short-term concern (i.e., net income), partly because governmental regulations on their operation and pollution prevention efforts are stricter than the other industrial sectors. This result may be seemingly inconsistent with Wang et al. (2014). Rather, the result indicates that successful energy firms can attain the corporate sustainability by investing eco-technology innovation, but unsuccessful ones cannot attain the sustainability, even in the short-term concern, because they do not have large capital accumulation for eco-technology investment whose importance has been first discussed by Sueyoshi and Goto (2010a). In other words, the eco-technology investment for enhancing a high level of corporate sustainability depends upon an amount of net income generated by each energy firm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The ability, and willingness, of wholesale distributors to asymmetrically pass on changes in diesel costs to consumers can adversely distort the market. Existing studies for Australia have focused on petrol (gasoil) prices, while there has been no testing for asymmetry in diesel prices. We test for rocket and feather effects in Australian wholesale diesel prices at their source. We find that in all seven seaport cities, when the price of oil goes up, diesel prices shoot up like a rocket and when the price of oil decreases, diesel prices fall like a feather. The asymmetric responses are more noticeable when oil prices are rising than falling.

During the democratic period, when the Weimar government introduced progovernment political news, the growth of Nazi popularity slowed down in areas with access to radio. This effect was reversed during the campaign for the last competitive election as a result of the pro-Nazi radio broadcast following Hitler's appointment as chancellor. During the consolidation of dictatorship, radio propaganda helped the Nazis enroll new party members. After the Nazis established their rule, radio propaganda incited anti-Semitic acts and denunciations of Jews to authorities by ordinary citizens. The effect of anti-Semitic propaganda varied depending on the listeners' predispositions toward the message. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect in places with historically low anti-Semitism.","[Adena, Maja] Wzb Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany; Univ Pompeu Fabra, Icrea Barcelona Inst Polit Econ & Governance, Barcelona Gse, Barcelona, Spain; New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; New Economic School; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Adena, M (通讯作者)，Wzb Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.",,"Enikolopov, Ruben/N-7403-2013; Petrova, Maria/L-2921-2014","Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-3496-2086",UniCredit and Universities; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,"UniCredit and Universities; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); ICREA(ICREA)","The research support of UniCredit and Universities (for Maria Petrova) and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, grant No. 14.U04.31.0002 (for Ruben Enikolopov and Maria Petrova) is gratefully acknowledged.

Member-country fiscal authorities lack commitment to repay their debt and choose fiscal policy independently. A common monetary authority chooses inflation for the union, also without commitment. We first describe the existence of a fiscal externality that arises in the presence of limited commitment and leads countries to overborrow; this externality rationalizes the imposition of debt ceilings in a monetary union. We then investigate the impact of the composition of debt in a monetary union, that is the fraction of high-debt versus low-debt members, on the occurrence of self-fulfilling debt crises. We demonstrate that a high-debt country may be less vulnerable to crises and have higher welfare when it belongs to a union with an intermediate mix of high-and low-debt members, than one where all other members are low-debt. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that all countries should prefer a union with low-debt members, as such a union can credibly deliver low inflation. These findings shed new light on the criteria for an optimal currency area in the presence of rollover crises.","[Aguiar, Mark] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Harvard University,"Aguiar, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,"NSF [0952816]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0952816] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Cristina Arellano, Patrick Kehoe, Enrique Mendoza, Tommaso Monacelli, Helene Rey, and seminar participants at several places for useful comments.

We show that the elasticities of health production, health investment and health cost determine jointly how health influences the wage rate. We examine the steady state and the equilibrium dynamics of the model. In the case of additive preferences, the existence of equilibrium and the stability of the dynamic system require that the ratio of the elasticities of the cost of health and health investment is greater than the elasticity of the production function of health. Health stock can have either positive or negative effects on wages via a mechanism of reservation wages. When preferences are multiplicative, the condition of the existence of equilibrium and the stability of the dynamic system reverse, and the effect of health stock on wages is always positive. Longevity is a decreasing convex-concave function of the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution of health. We also compare the relative behavior of opportunity costs of health under preference structure.","[Azomahou, Theophile T.; Soete, Luc] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Azomahou, Theophile T.; Soete, Luc] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Azomahou, Theophile T.; Diene, Bity] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand 1, France; [Diene, Mbaye] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, CRES, Dakar, Senegal",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Azomahou, TT (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",azomahou@merit.unu.edu; bity.diene@udamail.fr; mdiene@cres-sn.org; l.soete@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Soete, Luc/0000-0002-4616-6394",FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; UNU-MERIT,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); UNU-MERIT,"This study has immensely benefited from the comments of two anonymous referees and the co-editor of the Journal, Tim Kehoe.

Different insurance plans pay physicians different amounts for the same services, generating the required variation in financial incentives. We begin by presenting evidence that, unconditionally, plans that pay physicians more for more invasive treatments are associated with a larger fraction of such treatments. To interpret this correlation as causal, we continue by showing that it survives conditioning on a rich set of diagnosis and provider-specific variables. We perform a host of additional checks to verify that differences in unobservable patient or provider characteristics across plans are unlikely to be driving our results. We find that physicians' treatment choices respond positively to the payments they receive, and that the response is quite large. If physicians received bundled payments instead of fee-for-service incentives, for example, heart attack management would become considerably more conservative. Our estimates imply that 20 percent of patients would receive different treatments, physician costs would decrease by 27 percent, and social welfare would increase.","[Coey, Dominic] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Coey, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",coey@fb.com,,,Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research's Leonard W.

We examined the interpersonal relationships of a firm in two parts: (I) internal relationship - an organization's commitment to its employees' well-being (OCE) and (2) external relationship - managerial ties with the top executives of the other firms (business guanxi) and with government officials (political guanxi). More importantly, this study looked for whether OCE and guanxi would promote the profitable execution of competitive strategies (cost leadership, marketing differentiation and innovative differentiation). For this purpose, four hypotheses were developed and data was collected from 245 small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in a major industrial complex in China and analyzed with SPSS 20.0. The results were as follows: (I) OCE and guanxi both have a positive relationship with the financial and strategic performance of a firm. (2) The interaction between OCR and each different strategy showed different effects on a firm's performance. Also, the interaction between guanxi and different strategies went the same way. This indicates that even though maintaining good interpersonal relationships would improve a Chinese SME's performance, its importance and influence direction varies depending on which strategy is carried out. Such results suggest that business firms need to know the elaborate roles and meanings of interpersonal relationships in China..","[Lee, Jangwoo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Daegu 702701, South Korea; [Zhao, Haoyu] Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Xinxiang City 453003, Henan Province, Peoples R China",Kyungpook National University; Henan Institute of Science & Technology,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, 1370 Sankyuk Dong, Daegu 702701, South Korea.",antonio@knu.ac.kr; zhaohaoyu@hist.edu.cn,"Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023",,Kyungpook National University A.S Research Fund,Kyungpook National University A.S Research Fund,"This research was supported by Kyungpook National University A.S Research Fund, 2010.",,75,0,0,0,28,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

An analysis of the components of capital flows and of gross portfolio positions shows that foreign direct investment is directed towards countries with the highest growth rates, but that portfolio investment outflows exceed these inflows. Liberalized capital accounts further exacerbate this pattern.

In a setting that captures both these features, we show that the firm selection induced by trade liberalization works along two dimensions. First, export growth increases competition for skilled labour. This leads to the exit of some of the skilled-labour intensive firms, while benefitting unskilled-labour intensive ones. Second, within the group of firms with the same factor intensities, the reallocation of factors is towards the exporters. We show that the increased competition for skilled labour dampens the positive effect of trade liberalization on sector-wide TFP and real income.","[Namini, Julian Emami] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Namini, Julian Emami] Ctr Studi Luca dAgliano, Turin, Italy; [Facchini, Giovanni] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Facchini, Giovanni] Univ Milan, Ctr Studi Luca dAgliano, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Facchini, Giovanni] CEPR, London, England; [Facchini, Giovanni] CESifo, Oxford, England; [Lopez, Ricardo A.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; University of Nottingham; University of Milan; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Brandeis University,"López, RA (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",rlopez@brandeis.edu,,,EFIGE project - European Commission [225551],EFIGE project - European Commission,"We would like to thank participants at the North American Summer Meeting of the Econometric Society in St. Louis, EEA Annual Congress in Glasgow, ERWIT-CEPR conference in Nottingham, German Economic Association meeting in Kiel, Midwest International Economics meetings in Madison and the SAET conference in Faro for very useful comments.

Numerous frictions do not break this sharp result. We modify the Yaari framework by allowing a household's mortality risk itself to be stochastic due to health shocks. A lifetime annuity still helps to hedge longevity risk. But the annuity's remaining present value is correlated with medical costs, such as those for nursing home care, thereby reducing annuity demand, even without ad-hoc liquidity constraints. We find that most households should not hold a positive level of annuities, and many should hold negative amounts.","[Reichling, Felix] Congress Budget Off, Macroecon Anal Div, Washington, DC 20515 USA; [Smetters, Kent] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Smetters, Kent] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Congressional Budget Office; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Reichling, F (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Macroecon Anal Div, Ford House Off Bldg, Washington, DC 20515 USA.",felix.reichling@cbo.gov; smetters@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Social Security Administration (SSA) [5 RRC08098400-04-00],Social Security Administration (SSA),"Reichling: Macroeconomic Analysis Division, Congressional Budget Office, Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515 (e-mail: felix.reichling@cbo.gov); Smetters: Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, and NBER (e-mail: smetters@wharton.upenn.edu).

Unlike previous studies, we investigate the purified effect of foreign ownership by using domestic-acquired firms as the control group. After controlling for the acquisition effect that exists in domestic acquisitions, we find no evidence that foreign ownership can bring additional productivity gains to target firms, though both foreign and domestic acquisitions bring productivity improvements to target firms. In contrast, a strong and robust finding is that foreign ownership significantly improves target firms' financial conditions and exports relative to domestic-acquired firms. Foreign acquisition is also found to improve output, employment and wages for target firms. These findings conflict with the conventional view of productivity-driven FDI and highlight the financial channel through which FDI benefits the host countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When trade is liberalized, some multinationals find it more profitable to export and forgo the costs of maintaining capacities in foreign markets. I examine how this trade-off can have long-run effects on growth and welfare. The model emphasizes the importance of firms' ability to access multiple markets in providing incentives to innovate and highlights the role of the quality of technology in international technology spillovers for promoting growth.! find that by shutting down openness to both trade and multinational production with other OECD countries, the US would experience a welfare cost that is equivalent to a 39% drop in consumption, with the dynamic effect accounting for at least 40% of the estimated welfare cost. Since multinationals tend to use relatively high quality technology, trade liberalization alone can lead to an adverse effect on economic growth and consumer welfare by reducing the level of multinational production.

Using a New Keynesian model, our quantitative experiments suggest that, in contrast to the existing literature that ignores the liquidity trap situation, the unemployment benefit extension has reduced unemployment by 0.7 percentage points on average. The inflationary pressure caused by the benefit extension reduces the real interest rate and offsets the job search effects and the drop in firms' vacancy postings resulting from the increase in wages. Outside the ZLB, it has adverse effects on unemployment. Furthermore, the ZLB explains 0.9 percentage points of the rise in unemployment. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We provide a decomposition that allows us to quantify these two parts of inequality. Strikingly, the inequity component turns out to be a two-stage measure, that is, a measure that applies a unidimensional inequality measure to the vector of individual well-being levels. The decomposition also clarifies existing controversies surrounding two prominent transfer axioms, viz., uniform majorization and correlation increasing majorization.

However, methodological limitations related to selection into the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program have left room for doubt about this conclusion. This article uses birth records from New York City to address some limitations of the previous literature. We estimate models with mother fixed effects to control for fixed characteristics of mothers and we directly investigate the way that time-varying characteristics of mothers affect selection into the WIC program. We find that WIC is associated with reductions in low birth weight, even among full-term infants, and with reductions in the probability that a child is small for dates. These improvements are associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother gained too little weight during pregnancy. Improvements tend to be largest for first born children. We also find that women on WIC are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic conditions, and receive more intensive medical services, a finding that may reflect improved access to medical care.

First, we do not find that Madrassa students are less trusting of others; in fact, they exhibit the highest level of other-regarding behavior, and expect others to be the most trustworthy. Second, there is a high level of trust among all groups. Third, within each institution group, we fail to find evidence of in-group bias or systematic out-group bias either in trust or tastes.

We build a model that explains their emergence in response to the increasing importance of money for military success. When fiscal resources are not crucial for winning wars, the threat of external conflict stifles state-building. As finance becomes critical, internally cohesive states invest in state capacity while divided states rationally drop out of the competition, causing divergence. We emphasize the role of the Military Revolution, a sequence of technological innovations that transformed armed conflict. Using data from 374 battles, we investigate empirically both the importance of money for military success and patterns of state-building in early modern Europe.

In such a case, public expenditure is inefficiently low. If the government further loses the ability to set tax rates before production in the period takes place, then it will not internalize how its policy choices distort current factor markets. Thus, to counterbalance the costs of future distortions, it increases public good provision. For a calibrated economy, removing within-period commitment implies a welfare gain worth half a percent of yearly consumption.

Based on this information, they investigate the determinants of the apartment prices. Four factors are found to be relevant for the dwelling price level using Bayesian Model Averaging: Population density, mortgage per capita, income inequality, and unemployment rate. The results are robust to applying two alternative estimation techniques: OLS and quantile regression.

However, the impact on the level of variables (output, capital stock, labour, etc.) is permanent.

This article investigates the conditions under which guest workers have sufficient incentives for voluntary return to their country of origin when their work permits expire.

The analysis is conducted in the context of a lenient enforcement regime that avoids deportations of undocumented aliens. It relies instead on eligibility criteria and pricing instruments, such as partial withholding of salary and an exit tax for those who overstay, to provide incentives for voluntary return at the end of the contract period.

New annual GDP per capita data for six European countries over the last seven hundred years paint a clearer picture of the history of European economic development. We confirm that sustained growth has been a recent phenomenon, but reject the argument that there was no long-run growth in living standards before the Industrial Revolution. Instead, the evidence demonstrates the existence of numerous periods of economic growth before the nineteenth century-periods of unsustained, but raising GDP per capita. We also show that many of the economies experienced substantial economic decline. Thus, rather than being stagnant, pre-nineteenth century European economies experienced a great deal of change. Finally, we offer some evidence that, from the nineteenth century, these economies increased the likelihood of being in a phase of economic growth and reduced the risk of being in a phase of economic decline.","[Fouquet, Roger] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Broadberry, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Econ Hist, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford,"Fouquet, R (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.fouquet@lse.ac.uk; stephen.broadberry@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,"Fouquet, Roger/0000-0003-4732-0821",Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI); ESRC; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Simon Dietz, Baran Doda, Gordon Hanson, Ralph Hippe, Alexander Klein, Enrico Moretti, Suresh Naidu, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, Debraj Ray, Martin Stuermer, Timothy Taylor, and John van Reenen, as well as participants at the AEA annual meeting, for discussions related to this paper, and Bas van Leeuwen, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, Nuno Palma, Jaime Reis, and Nico Voigtlander for their data.

Both difference-in-difference estimation and simulations using a random coefficients logit model suggest that divestitures are important for dampening price increases. Prices of divested brands fall by around 3% and the predicted price increase for Carlsberg falls from 3 to 1.6% as a result of the divestitures. To guide practice on divestitures, we investigate the role of the recipient and the number and characteristics of the divested products by simulating post-merger outcomes for all relevant cases. We find that in this setting with large multiproduct firms, the competition authority's most effective means to dampen adverse post-merger outcomes are to aim for a small recipient firm and attain a large number of divested products. Enforcing larger divestitures in terms of market share and raising the average cross-price elasticity between the merging parties' divested and retained products strengthen the dampening effect further.

An improvement in the trade balance induces relative wages to overshoot their long-run value, placing downward pressure on the terms of trade of the same order of magnitude found in Armington type models. Once the pattern of specialization changes, some of the decline is reversed with a smaller value of depreciation. We find that persistent productivity differentials do not cause distinct trends in the terms of trade. The result depends on the size of the non-tradable sector and the variability of industry-specific efficiencies. We also find that self-selection into export markets causes the relative price of non-tradable goods to respond to exogenous shift, giving birth to an endogenous Balassa-Samuelson effect. The model also suggests that in the long-run the variation of the real exchange rate is dominated by the volatility of the terms of trade.","[Galstyan, Vahagn] IIIS, Dublin, Ireland; [Galstyan, Vahagn] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Galstyan, V (通讯作者)，IIIS, Dublin, Ireland.",v.galstyan@tcd.ie,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

There have been numerous explanations posited and this paper adds a novel one: that artists are time inconsistent and hence, tend to underweight fame over fortune when making future choices; i.e., the degree to which they will 'sell out.' Regardless of whether selling out is anticipated or not, the puzzle is resolved. When selling out is not anticipated, future expectations of piracy are not a concern as these only impact on monetary awards that are not driving entry. When selling out is anticipated, piracy actually constrains the degree to which artists sell out, and assured of that, raises entry returns. Implications and the role of publisher contracts are also explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Post-Keynesians are sceptical of the usefulness of the equilibrium method and favour an approach based on path-determined models with, due to the influence of uncertainty on economic decisions, an important role assigned to money, institutions and rules of thumb. As there are no forces within capitalist economies which can guarantee full employment, government intervention is important. While monetary policy is seen as a rather blunt instrument, fiscal policy is perceived to be much more potent than it is in the mainstream. However, there are inherent limits to the achievement of sustained full employment in capitalist economies.","[Hart, Neil] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kriesler, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kriesler, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",p.kriesler@unsw.edu.au,"Kriesler, Peter/J-9164-2012",,,,,,66,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

However, government still plays a key role in the energy sector by allocating energy conservation and emissions abatement. How does the government make an equity decision as a tradeoff to market efficiency? This is an unanswered question. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the government's preference toward equity and efficiency. Using the provincial level CO2 intensity allocation data, we investigate the political decision that the government made based on the equity and efficiency criteria We find that the equity index plays a more important role than the efficiency index in determining the CO2 intensity target. In addition, political factors such as social stability are found to be important factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on steam coal prices set by the largest world exporters and importers on both the Atlantic and the Pacific markets. We use weekly data spanning from October 5, 2001 to March 28, 2014. The aim is achieved in two stages. During the first one, we use the rolling trace test to identify the integration of the steam coal market, and during the second one, we apply the rolling weak exogeneity test to determine the roles of the participants of the international steam coal market, namely price setters and price takers. Our main findings can be summarized in two observations. Firstly, the main world steam coal prices are integrated and during the period when freight costs are higher, the coal market integration is weaker, and when the costs are lower, the integration is stronger. Secondly, the role of particular coal prices is not stable in time. Generally, price setters appear in the market which covers greater shares in the physical coal trade. Although Indonesia and Russia have a great share in the global export, their prices remain price takers during the whole period. As a consequence, although Russia remains the largest coal exporter of the steam coal to the European market, it cannot dictate its prices in this market.

If labor and resources are complements, income and fertility dynamics are unstable and drive the economy towards either demographic explosion or collapse. We calibrate the model numerically to match past US data on fertility and land scarcity, obtaining future scenarios for the current century and quantifying the response of fertility and productivity to exogenous shocks.","[Peretto, Pietro F.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Valente, Simone] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Duke University; University of East Anglia,"Peretto, PF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Room 241, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",peretto@econ.duke.edu; s.valente@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,38,38,2,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Historically, ODA assessed the subsidy element of aid loans using a discount rate of 10 per cent. Low borrowing interest rates for donor governments enabled them to lend at rates low enough to qualify as ODA, yet high enough to turn a profit. This ignited controversy. In 2014, ODA's treatment of loans was officially overhauled-for the better, in the sense of aligning the ODA 'reward' for a loan to its value. A third way would be better still. The DAC and researchers could improve matters by taking discount rates from the Export Credit Arrangement than from the IMF; and to forgo discounting for default risk, except for innovative loans whose terms bind the lender to share country risk.

Frequent opportunities to trade can lead to large distortions in prices if some agents forecast future prices using a simplified model of the world that fails to distinguish between some states. In the limit as the period length vanishes, these distortions take a particular form: the price must be the same in any two states that a positive mass of agents categorize together. Price distortions therefore tend to be large when different agents categorize states in different ways, even if each individual's categorization is not very coarse. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze optimal selection when individuals differ with respect to their ability to transform training into skills and relative age. The latter is considered a major determinant for initial within-cohort performance differentials. The optimal policy is pro-competitive at later selection stages in the sense of selecting the individuals with the higher skill signals. In early stages, pro-competitive selection, counter-competitive selection or no selection can be the optimal policy, depending on the size of the relative age differences and on the degree of heterogeneity with respect to ability in the population. We show that under the optimal selection policy the probability of allocating high intensity training to the individuals with highest ability is not monotone with respect to the size of the relative age advantage. Finally, the (empirical) observation of persistent relative age effects does not necessarily hint at suboptimal selection policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we test within a unified framework how the process of institution formation is affected by three key aspects of natural environments: (i) heterogeneity among players in the benefits of cooperation, (ii) (a)symmetry in players' institutional obligations, and (iii) potential trade-offs between efficiency and equality in payoff allocations. We observe social preferences to be limiting the scope for institution formation. Inequality-averse players frequently object to institutions that fail to address differences in players' benefits from cooperation - even if rejecting the institution causes monetary losses to all players. Relating our findings to previous studies on institution formation, we discuss potential advantages and drawbacks of stipulating unanimous support for implementing institutions that foster cooperation.

One explanation for these national differences in tipping customs is that they reflect national differences in attitude toward tipping, sensitivity to duty/obligation to tip, and sensitivity to social pressure to tip. Furthermore, these variables have been hypothesized to mediate the previously observed effects on tipping customs of national extraversion, psychoticism and neuroticism respectively. Analyses of secondary data found support for these explanations of national differences in tipping customs, but only partial support for their roles as mediators of national personality effects on tipping customs. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed along with study limitations and directions for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we extend a Melitz and Ottaviano () type trade model with variable mark-ups to allow for endogenous technology adoption. We consider a framework with two countries that potentially differ with respect to credit market development. Firms have the option to adopt a more efficient technology by paying some fixed cost that is more costly to finance for financially constrained firms. We find that technology adoption increases in both countries after trade liberalization but more so in the financially more developed country: the productivity gap widens. Simulations show that the welfare gap widens too. Opening up without sufficient access to external funding thus fails to promote convergence.","[Peters, Katrin; Schnitzer, Monika] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Schnitzer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",schnitzer@econ.lmu.de,,,[SFB-TR 15]; [GRK 801],;,Financial support through SFB-TR 15 and GRK 801 is gratefully acknowledged.,,40,9,9,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We examine how an unknown debt target affects economic activity using a real business cycle model in which Bayesian households learn about a state-dependent debt target in an endogenous tax rule. Recent papers use stochastic volatility shocks to study fiscal uncertainty. In our setup, the fiscal rule is time-varying due to unknown changes in the debt target. Households infer the current debt target from a noisy tax rule and jointly estimate the transition probabilities. Three key findings emerge from our analysis: (1) limited information about the debt target amplifies the effect of tax shocks through changes in expected tax rates; (2) the welfare losses are an order of magnitude larger when both the debt target state and transition matrix are unknown than when only the debt target state is unknown to households; (3) an unknown debt target likely reduced the stimulative effect of the ARRA and uncertainty about the sunset provision in the Bush tax cuts may have slowed the recovery and led to welfare losses.

The cost of the conflict is measured as output forgone relative to what it would have prevailed had Greece followed a post-war recovery similar to that of other nations in Western Europe. A two-stage approach compares Nazi-occupied countries with neutral ones to assess the cost inflicted by Second World War, and then compares Greece with the former to estimate the impact of the civil conflict. A regional analysis finds that the political discontent was mainly shaped by pre-war socio-economic grievances, rather than being affected by contemporaneous deprivation or driven by class structure as hardliners of both sides preferred to present in pushing for an all-out confrontation. The failure to settle political rivalries and thus prevent the conflict is also discussed.","[Christodoulakis, Nicos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int Econ & European Studies, Athens, Greece; [Christodoulakis, Nicos] London Sch Econ, Hellen Observ, London WC2A 2AE, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Christodoulakis, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Hellen Observ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",N.Christodoulakis@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Using a panel of 74 developing countries from 1980 to 2012, I find that positive food price shocks reduce life expectancy at birth both in the fixed-effect model and in the dynamic panel model while negative food price shocks do not seem to matter for this human development indicator in the static model but adversely affect it in the dynamic model. I also find that both positive and negative shocks have no effect on youth literacy rate; this probably means that households do not react to food price shocks by taking children out of school. Analysing the role of commercial openness, I find that openness policy enhances countries' capacity to manage the adverse effects of food price shocks on life expectancy at birth. This suggests that the tempting policy option of reducing openness to trade during food price shocks is not an efficient choice as regards the human development. Countries must therefore set institutional arrangements that could prevent policy-makers from taking this inefficient policy option.","Univ Ngaoundere, Dept Econ, Ngaoundere, Cameroon",,"Nourou, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ngaoundere, Dept Econ, POB 454, Ngaoundere, Cameroon.",nourouacademy@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Currently, the Chilean Congress is enacting a tax reform to raise money for higher education. This study aims to show the dynamic effects on the general equilibrium of the Chilean economy under two alternative approaches: a subsidy to lower the price of higher education (public and private), and greater spending on public higher education to reduce household payments for education. The social accounting matrix (SAM) used to calibrate the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model has 38 economic sectors, including the production structure of private education and public education. The study mainly concludes that a subsidy policy has significant advantages over increasing higher public education spending, regarding its effects on variables such as GDP, investment, and household incomes, while both policies have a similar effect on poverty and income distribution.","Univ Concepcion, Dept Ind Engn, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion,"Mardones, C (通讯作者)，Univ Concepcion, Dept Ind Engn, Concepcion, Chile.",crismardones@udec.cl,"mardones, cristian/AAV-5245-2020; mardones, cristian/AAX-9163-2020","mardones, cristian/0000-0002-9389-7368",National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) [11110007],National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),The author is grateful to the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) (initiation project no. 11110007) for the financing it provided for this research.,,14,5,5,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The struggle between groups that disagree on targeted public spending (e.g., pork) results in governments being endogenously short-sighted: Systematic underinvestment in infrastructure and overspending on targeted goods arise; above and beyond what is observed in symmetric environments. Because the party enjoying an electoral advantage is less short-sighted, it devotes a larger proportion of revenues to productive investment. Hence, political turnover induces economic fluctuations in an otherwise deterministic environment. I characterize analytically the long-run distribution of allocations and show that output increases with electoral advantage, despite the fact that governments expand. Volatility is non-monotonic in electoral advantage and is an additional source of inefficiency. Using panel data from US states I confirm these findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Unfortunately, designing mechanisms that induce socially efficient outcomes often requires full information and prohibitively large computational resources. In this work we study simple mechanisms that require only local information. Specifically, in the setting of a classic scheduling problem, we demonstrate local mechanisms that induce outcomes with social cost close to that of the socially optimal solution. Somewhat counter-intuitively, we find that mechanisms yielding Pareto dominated outcomes may in fact enhance the overall performance of the system, and we provide a justification of these results by interpreting these inefficiencies as externalities being internalized. We also show how to employ randomization to obtain yet further improvements.

In this paper, I present a model of dynamic incentives where lenders are uncertain over how much borrowers value future loans. Loan terms are determined endogenously, and loans become more favorable as the probability of default becomes lower. I show that in all equilibria but one all borrowers, including the most patient ones, eventually default. I then consider an extension where borrowers can take loans from several lenders, double-dipping. Qualitatively, properties of equilibria with and without double-dipping are similar. In absolute terms, when borrowers are credit-constrained double-dipping equilibrium loans have to be more favorable to outweigh increased gains from default (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

COOPER; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS,"This study discusses a new use of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) environmental assessment to measure unified (operational and environmental) and scale efficiencies among inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs. In particular, the measurement of scale efficiency is discussed by two non-radial models. That is a new methodological contribution. To discuss these efficiency measures, this study first examines a concept of disposability from the perspective of corporate strategies to adapt a regulation change on undesirable outputs. The concept is separated into natural and managerial disposability. After discussing how to measure the degree of scale efficiency within the non-radial approach, this study applies the proposed DEA environmental assessment to measure the performance of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. north-east region. The region has been long producing a large amount of coal from the Appalachian Mountains. The coal mining industry has supported U.S. energy utility and other industries. Because of the long history, the quality of coal became worse and the coal-fired power plants have been producing a large amount of undesirable gases. This study has statistically confirmed that there is a significant difference between the two types (BIT: bituminous coal and SUB: subbituminous coal) of coal-fired power plants in terms of their unified efficiency measures, including their scale efficiencies, under the concept of managerial disposability (the first priority: environment performance and the second priority: operational performance). In contrast, under the natural disposability (the first priority: operational performance and the second priority: environmental performance), this study cannot find such a statistical significance between them. The fact, in which BIT outperforms SUB in terms of their unified and scale efficiencies, suggests the policy implication that these power plants need to shift their coal combustions from SUB to BIT in the United States. Besides the empirical finding, this study cannot confirm the other hypothesis on whether coal-fired power plants with small operation (less than 50% in plant capacity factor) outperform ones with large operation (more than 50% in plant capacity factor), and vice versa, in terms of their unified and scale efficiency measures under natural and managerial disposability. An exception is found in environmental performance under variable returns to scale. The rationale is because their plant operations are frequently monitored by regulatory agencies. As a consequence, this study cannot find such a statistical difference between them on operational performance. This result implies that the regulation on coal-fired power plants has been effective on their unified performance but large power plants may have a potential to improve their environmental performance.

From a neo-Kaldorian perspective, this paper seeks to establish the concepts of demand and productivity regimes in an open version of the pure labour Pasinettian model. In order to derive the demand regime, a disaggregated version of the static Harrod foreign multiplier is derived, while the productivity regime is built in terms of disaggregated Kaldor-Verdoorn laws. The upshot is a multi-sectoral growth model of structural change and cumulative causation, in which an open version of the Pasinettian model to foreign trade maybe obtained as a particular case. Furthermore, we show that the evolution of demand patterns, while being affected by differential rates of productivity growth in different sectors of the economy, also play an important role in establishing the pace of technical progress.

We find support for the view that market structure is also partly responsible for high NIMs in SSA, although quantitatively this effect is somewhat less important. High operating costs, high treasury-bill rates and a high ratio of equity to total assets and, indirectly, institutional factors, such as the rule of law, are the most important factors in accounting for high interest margins in the East African Community, relative to other regions.","[Boutin-Dufresne, Francois; Williams, Oral] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zawisza, Tomasz A.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",International Monetary Fund; University of Cambridge,"Williams, O (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",owilliams2@imf.org,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The model displays a unique steady state, which is then used to study the long-run effects of strengthening secrecy protection.

If the managers only care about efficiency in their respective locations, either coexistence of conventions or global coordination on the risk-dominant equilibrium will be selected, depending on the (effective) capacities of both locations. If they are concerned with scale and can choose mobility constraints, global coordination on the risk-dominant equilibrium without mobility will be selected in the long run.

We present a meta-model of structural change that combines information from empirical evidence (stylized facts) with information on the geometrical properties of typical trajectories stud.: led in structural change theory. In particular, our approach is based on three facts: (1) structural change in three-sector models is defined on a 2-simplex; (2) the trajectory of past structural change partitions the 2-simplex into economically interpretable sections; (3) the typical properties of structural change trajectories (e.g. non-self-intersection) prohibit some movements from one section to another. Jointly, these facts imply that structural change is path-dependent and that the number of feasible structural change scenarios can be reduced significantly. While we focus on labour allocation dynamics, our approach can be applied to other topics (e.g. income distribution dynamics). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To address the dynamics in the growth relationships, the study also performs time-varying regression and variance decomposition analyses. It covers the quarterly sample period from 1991:Q1 to 2010:Q2. The econometric results suggest that all the three variables have a positive impact on economic growth and thus are catalytic to economic growth. However, the growth effect of domestic direct investment is more stable than that of the other two growth determinants. Contrary to earlier empirical studies, the variance decomposition analysis herein reveals that domestic direct investment is the most important determinant of growth in the long-run (L-R) compared to exports and foreign direct investment.","[Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Tan, Eu Chye] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222","Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya","Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya","The earlier draft of this research was presented at the PSU-USM International Conference on Humanities and Social Sciences 2011, at BP Grand Tower Hotel, Hatyai, Thailand on 3-4, October 2011.

This vision of capital contrasts with more heterodox definitions, clarifying that capital actually represents social relations of power. Mainstream economic texts and prominent practitioners continue to give the production function view central importance in the theories they advance. An issue arises for those who espouse the mainstream view, when looking at certain types of non-collateralized debt obligations, such as student loans. If those owning student debt own capital, which seems true, then what exactly do they own? Using student debt as a crucible, I explore the issue of which definition of capital has better explanatory power.

We consider an otherwise standard consumption-based asset pricing model except that the representative agent has limited information about the economy. Specifically, he does not know the true model of the economy and therefore decides to pursue optimal consumption paths that are robust to model misspecification. The empirical results show that this robustness concern can account for many features of the bond yields in the US. In particular, it can solve the term premium puzzle faced by standard consumption-based models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This approach opens a window for research access to multiple sets of official firm-level data over national borders and in dimensions not earlier available. The process starts by an extensive metadata analysis, where microdata from different sources (in this case, business registers, production, trade, education and ICT statistics) are harmonized to ensure comparability over time and across countries. An identical code is then run on each national data set, linking and aggregating information and analytical results to a level where disclosure issues disappear. Subsequently, the aggregated data are pooled into a cross-country data set. This data set is called the Micro Moments Database and is available for research purposes at the Eurostat safe centre. Initial results show that there is a relationship between the decision to export and the ICT usage of firms. However, what kind of ICT is most beneficial for the firms seems to vary across countries, possibly connected to the general level of ICT intensity.","Stat Sweden, SE-10461 Stockholm, Sweden",Statistics Sweden,"Hagsten, E (通讯作者)，Stat Sweden, Box 24300, SE-10461 Stockholm, Sweden.",eva.hagsten@scb.se,"Hagsten, Eva/AAL-7086-2020; Hagsten, Eva/AAH-7574-2019","Hagsten, Eva/0000-0001-7091-1449",,,,,7,7,7,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The non-linear behavior, the skewed and leptokurtic returns, the presence of structural breaks and the constant political instability in suppliers' countries evidence the necessity of complex models to capture the market volatility. At the same time, crude oil is the raw material for several fuels such as jet fuel, gasoline, diesel and others, having a strong influence over their prices. Thus, this study aims to verify the presence of structural breaks in the volatility series and in the correlations between WTI return and the returns of Gasoline, Kerosene Jet Fuel, Diesel, Heating Oil, Propane and Natural Gas. To reach this objective, we identified which model presents the best fit to estimate the conditional mean between WTI and each fuel and we used a Copula-DCC-GARCH model to estimate the conditional volatility avoiding the frequently unrealistic presumptions of normality. Our main results indicate the necessity of a different model for each analyzed pair and the presence of at least one structural break in the conditional volatility and in the correlation between WTI and each fuel, usually preceded by a structural break in WTI return series.

The most restrictive laws make it harder to fire permanent workers for firms. However, these laws do not apply to workers hired through contractors (contract workers). Using firm-level data from India, I find that compared to firms in flexible labor regulations, those in more restrictive labor regimes hire more contract workers as a response to transitory local demand shocks. I find no differential response in hiring of permanent workers by firms faced with these shocks. This suggests that firms circumvent labor laws by hiring workers indirectly through contractors in the face of economic fluctuations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When the agents' preferences are single-dimensional Myerson's seminal work (1981) shows that randomness offers no benefit the optimal mechanism is always deterministic. In the multi-dimensional case, when agents' preferences are arbitrarily correlated, Briest et al. (2010) showed that the gap between the expected revenue obtained by an optimal randomized mechanism and an optimal deterministic mechanism can be unbounded even when a single agent is offered only 4 services. We show that when the agents' values involve no correlation or a specific kind of positive correlation, the benefit of randomness is only a small constant factor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Using an unbalanced panel of 17653 firms over the period 1986-2001 in France, 8728 firms over the period 1994-2006 in Japan and 7828 firms over the period 1993-2008 in the Netherlands, we first apply two procedures to classify 30 comparable manufacturing industries in 6 distinct regimes that differ in terms of the type of competition prevailing in product and labor markets. For each of the predominant regimes in each country, we then investigate industry differences in the estimated product and labor market imperfections and scale economies. Consistent with differences in institutions and in the industrial relations system in the three countries, we find important regime differences across the three countries and also observe differences in the levels of product market imperfections and scale economies within regimes.

A good understanding of the optimal pollution price under these mechanisms is a premise for regulators to make sound pollution control policies. In this paper, we propose a method for deriving the optimal pollution price for a given pollution target This method consists of two steps that integrate cost function estimation and market equilibrium analysis: First, historical data is used to estimate the pollution abatement cost functions of the polluters; second, market models are used to solve the equilibrium pollution price under each control mechanism. For illustration, we apply the method to investigate SO2 emission control policies in China, using a dataset of SO2 emissions and abatement costs from three major industry sectors (Electricity, Gas, and Water Supply; Manufacturing; and Mining). Our analysis shows that the optimal levy rate is significantly higher than the actual rate adopted by the Chinese government For example, the optimal levy rate should be 4.92 RMB/kg, while the actual rate is 1.26 RMB/kg in 2010. As a result, the actual emission structure is much less efficient: The overall cost savings would be 49.7% for all three sectors during 2006-2010 if the optimal emission structure is achieved. These findings have useful policy implications for the Chinese government In addition, the method may be applied to analyze control policies at different aggregate levels (for example, provincial economies) or for other pollutants (for example, CO2 and chemical oxygen demand).

This makes the analysis of real exchange rates at all frequencies a more sound exercise than the typical business cycle one, which compares actual and simulated data after the Hodrick-Prescott filter is applied to both. A simple two-country, two-good, international real business cycle model can explain the volatility of the real exchange rate when all frequencies are studied. The puzzle is that the model generates too much persistence of the real exchange rate instead of too little, as the business cycle analysis asserts. We show that the introduction of input adjustment costs in production, cointegrated productivity shocks across countries, and lower home bias allows us to reconcile theory and this feature of the data.

Despite stipulating that daughters would have equal shares as sons in ancestral property, I find that the reform failed to increase the actual likelihood of women inheriting property. Instead, parents appear to be gifting their share of land to their sons in order to circumvent the law. However, parents also appear to be compensating their daughters for such disinheritance by giving them alternative transfers in the form of either higher dowries or more education following the reform.

Strengthening patent protection decreases the amount of common knowledge, which has two asymmetric effects on incentives to innovate. First, as competitors cannot freely use technological information, it helps successful innovators earn higher profits. Second, less disclosure of information reduces R&D productivity. The model shows that the relative importance of patents versus trade secrets determines whether the former positive effect dominates the latter negative effect. As a result, strengthened patent protection can increase economic growth when the risk of leakage of trade secrets is high. Conversely, when the risk is low, stronger patent protection hinders growth. Similar opposing results are also found in welfare analysis.","[Suzuki, Keishun] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan; [Suzuki, Keishun] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Tohoku University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Suzuki, K (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Aoba Ku, 27-1 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan.",keishun.suzuki@gmail.com,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [25-10619]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [13J10619] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank Ryo Horii, Akiomi Kitagawa, Koki Oikawa, Yunfang Hu, numerous people who commented on earlier versions of the paper in the 2012 Japan Economic Association Spring Meeting at Hokkaido University, attendees at the 2013 Asian Meeting of Econometric Society in Singapore, and three anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscripts.

Recently, conservation has received considerable attention in the United States and in particular in the European Union but this time in order to mitigate global warming. Policy measures include regulations at the technical level and the introduction of white certificates in order to force utilities and firms to invest into conservation in a way similar to the already existing renewable energy quota.

Spatial variants have been proposed to account for the particularities of spatial data, namely spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation, and we present a novel approach which transfers PCA into the spatio-temporal realm. Our approach, named spatio-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA), allows for dimension reduction in the attribute space while striving to preserve much of the data's variance and maintaining the data's original structure in the spatio-temporal domain. Additionally to spatial autocorrelation stPCA exploits any serial correlation present in the data and consequently takes advantage of all particular features of spatial-temporal data. A simulation study underlines the superior performance of stPCA if compared to the original PCA or its spatial variants and an application on indicators of economic deprivation and urbanism demonstrates its suitability for practical use.","[Stahlschmidt, Stephan] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Haerdle, Wolfgang K.] Humboldt Univ, CASE, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Thome, Helmut] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Sociol, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Stahlschmidt, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",stahlschmidt@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; haerdle@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; helmut.thome@soziologie.uni-halle.de,"Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013","Stahlschmidt, Stephan/0000-0003-3390-8632; Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 649]; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin [IRTG 1792],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin,"The financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via SFB 649 'Okonomisches Risiko', Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series', Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, is gratefully acknowledged.",,24,6,6,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

In the model, scholars decide to adopt a new idea only if they believe that a critical mass of peers is following a similar research strategy. If researchers observe only a noisy idiosyncratic signal of the true scientific potential of a new idea, we show that the game presents a single threshold equilibrium. In this environment, fundamental research proceeds with large structural breaks followed by long periods of time in which new ideas are unsuccessful. The likelihood of a new idea emerging depends on various parameters, including the rewards of working in the old paradigm, the critical mass of researchers required to create a new school of thought and scholars' ability to properly assess the scientific value of new ideas.

By reviewing bibliographic references in the RePEc data base, it is found that worldwide research using approaches on the edge of mainstream economics grew substantially in the period 2000-2012, while this type of research is relatively rare in Mexico. This lack of plurality is also reflected in the country's study programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, where the curricular structure is limited mainly to an orthodox perspective and, in few cases, to an heterodox focus (i. e., outside mainstream).","CIDE, Sioux Lookout, ON, Canada",,"Castañeda, G (通讯作者)，CIDE, Sioux Lookout, ON, Canada.",gonzalo.castaneda@cide.edu,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We show that the equilibrium outcomes may result in a prisoners' dilemma, depending on the characteristics of between-group externalities. If between-group externalities are strongly positive (negative), within-group cooperation does not occur in either group, which leads to Pareto-inferior (superior) outcomes for all agents. On the other hand, if between-group externalities are weakly positive or negative, each group chooses to cooperate within a group in providing public goods, but it may reduce utility of both group members.

Three fiscal sustainability conditions are identified in one VAR model: the stance of government, Domar (1944)-type GDP growth, and other factors. The main findings are summarized as follows. First, a regime switch occurred in the early 1990s. In the first regime, it appears that the government adopted the Ricardian stance to past debt levels, while such fiscal reactions are not observed in the second regime. Furthermore, only in the second regime, Domar (1944)-type income growth significantly decreases the debt-GDP ratio. Second, however, the contributions of these two shocks are minor in explaining historical variances of the debt-GDP ratio in both regimes. Third, forecast simulations reveal that the debt-GDP ratio is not sustainable in the second regime. Fourth, counterfactual simulations show that around 2 percent nominal growth or a Ricardian fiscal stance can keep the debt-GDP ratio sustainable. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First-time offenders are then deterred not only by the (restricted) fine for a first offense, but also by the prospect of a large fine for a subsequent offense. Now suppose therestriction on penalties for first-time offenders is relaxed; i.e., larger fines for a first offense become enforceable. Should overdeterrence of repeat offenders now be reduced? We show that this is the case only if the original restriction was not very strong. Otherwise, overdeterrence of repeat offenders should actually be further amplified. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper uses a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the policy impact for U.S. states that restructured their electricity retail markets. The results suggest that in restructured states, only residential customers have benefited from significantly lower prices but not commercial or industrial customers. Furthermore, this benefit is transitory and disappears in the long run.

I also compare the effects of fatherhood between different cohorts by dividing the JPSC sample into two birth-year cohorts (those born in or before 1960 and those born after 1960). The results show that the birth of children significantly increases hourly wage rates by 2.3% and annual work by 69 hours. Comparing these results to those of studies based in the United States and Germany shows that while the effect of childbirth on the Japanese male labor supply is large, it is relatively small on wage rates. The study also shows that childbirth has different impacts on labor market outcomes for the two cohorts. In the early cohort, the birth of children significantly increases wage rates, but has no significant effect on the labor supply. On the contrary, for the later cohort, the birth of children does not increase wage rates and there is a significant increase in the labor supply. Finally, I examine how the gender difference of children impacts labor market outcomes.

The optimal selling strategy assigns posted prices to lotteries (probability distributions over items), and it is known that pricing lotteries can be strictly superior to pricing individual items. Our results quantify the magnitude of this phenomenon and shed light on the computational hardness of determining (or approximating) the optimal selling strategy. In particular, we show that when the number of items is at least three, there is no finite upper bound on the ratio between the maximum revenue attainable by pricing lotteries and that which can be attained by pricing items. Furthermore, the time required to compute the optimal selling strategy is polynomial in the support size of the buyer's type distribution. We also show that these two results are reversed in a model in which the buyer is allowed to buy any desired number of lotteries and receive an independent sample from each: the ratio between the revenue of the optimal selling strategy and that which can be attained by pricing items is only logarithmic in the number of goods n, and under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions there is no polynomial-time algorithm to compute or even approximate the optimal selling strategy.

Firm-level demand is determined by expected quality, which is driven by the dynamics of consumer learning through experience and the country of origin's reputation for quality. We show that asymmetric information can result in multiple steady-state equilibria with endogenous reputation. We identify two types of steady states: a high-quality equilibrium (HQE) and a low-quality equilibrium (LQE). In a LQE, only the lowest-quality and the highest-quality firms are active; a range of relatively high-quality firms are permanently kept out of the market by the informational friction. Countries with bad quality reputation can therefore be locked into exporting low-quality, low-cost goods. Our model delivers novel insights about the dynamic impact of trade policies. First, an export subsidy increases the steady-state average quality of exports and welfare in a LQE, but decreases both quality and welfare in a HQE. Second, there is a tax/subsidy scheme based on the duration of export experience that replicates the perfect information outcome. Third, a minimum quality standard can help an economy initially in a LQE moving to a HQE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to previous studies on Turkey, the existence of twin deficits is investigated by regime-dependent impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions based on a multivariate two-regime threshold VAR (WAR) model. Our results suggest that the dynamics between the current account and budget account variables are affected by macroeconomic activity: twin deficits are only the case in the upper regime, when the economy operates above its potential level. When the economy is in the lower regime, budget and trade deficits show divergent movements.

Eighty participants-20 real couples and 20 pairs of strangers-play a two-stage game, paired up either with their partner or a stranger of the opposite sex. In the first stage, participants make a joint decision on how to play the game: They can both complete a performance-based paid task (task A) or have one of the players perform an unpaid task (task B), thereby tripling the pay-rate for the partner playing task A. After completing their tasks, participants are informed about their pay-offs in private and then asked to make an individual decision about what proportion of their income to pay into a common pool, where it is increased by 20 % and distributed equally between the two players. I find that women are significantly more likely to give up their income autonomy and perform the unpaid task when playing with their partner rather than with an unfamiliar man. Men's behavior is not affected by familiarity with their female partner.","Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Görges, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.",luise.goerges@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,65,8,9,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The strongest agreements are with both parts of the article's objective: to move away from mechanistic economic models and toward a more evolutionary and institutional approach to economic theory and policy. The pursuit of the first part is most seriously criticized for two illegitimate extensions of initially sound arguments, and the pursuit of the second part, for climbing up to a too abstract metatheoretic level, from which it loses the view of the concrete results that modern economics has already obtained.","Univ Econ, Dept Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pelikan, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavel.pelikan@vse.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

While fiscal policies are typically assessed with respect to the inter-personal dimension of inequality, they may well have heterogeneous impacts across different cohorts, thus raising the issue of intergenerational fairness. We take the case of Italy over the period 1990-2008 to show how such possibly unfair effects can be measured by adapting the methods developed in the context of the generational accounting literature. Importantly, we aim to work on a comprehensive approach, so that reforms involving several taxation and spending programmes, possibly implemented over several years, can be assessed. We find that a significant improvement in public finance sustainability came at the price of an unequal distribution of sacrifices across living generations, with younger cohorts contributing far more over their residual life-cycle.","[Pertile, Paolo; Polin, Veronica] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Rizza, Pietro; Romanelli, Marzia] Banca Italia, Econ Res Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",University of Verona; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Romanelli, M (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",paolo.pertile@univr.it; veronica.polin@univr.it; pietro.rizza@bancaditalia.it; marzia.romanelli@bancaditalia.it,,"Pertile, Paolo/0000-0002-6555-5491",,,,,27,1,1,0,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

As grandparents can help to take care of young children, the impact of preschoolers is insignificant. Having elderly family to care for decreases the income earned by female members of the family. Although both men and women are actively engaged in off-farm employment today in rural China, this study shows that women are still the primary care providers for both children and the elderly.

We study the liquid milk market which has seen much controversy about both the distribution of rents and the mechanisms firms have used to influence the distribution. We discuss insights from a series of interviews we conducted with executives and farmer representatives. Our interviews suggest a model in which the farmer's price is determined mainly by the sterling value of international commodity prices; the retail price is determined by marginal costs and the intensity of supermarket competition; and the wholesale price is determined in private bilateral negotiations between retailers and processors which are characterized by well-informed agents and a high level of efficiency. We present a simple theoretical model that captures these features and bring it to data on supply chain prices for the period 1994-2014. We find that over this period there has been great variation in the intensity of retail price competition and in the sterling value of international commodity markets, which together result in large changes both to the overall surplus in the supply chain and to its distribution between farmers and the other firms. After farmers have been paid the sterling value of international commodity prices, the profit that remains to be split between processors and retailers mostly goes to supermarkets, because of competition between processors.","[Smith, Howard] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Smith, Howard] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Thanassoulis, John] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Warwick Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Thanassoulis, John] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Smith, H (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",howard.smith@economics.ox.ac.uk; john.thanassoulis@wbs.ac.uk,,,DairyCo; DEFRA,"DairyCo; DEFRA(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA))","We would like to thank the executives from the milk supply chain who agreed to participate in the executive interviews described in this paper.

The empirical analysis strongly supports arguments against the thesis that in Europe sovereign debt is the problem and fiscal austerity the solution. On the contrary, it suggests that the current crisis should be analysed in the light of the growing disproportion of the financial sector compared to real sectors of the economy. This study divides the financial assets generated by the domestic financial companies and by the foreign sector into two aggregates: a proxy for financial resources channelled to the real domestic sectors and a proxy for financial assets overhang held within the financial and foreign sector. The financial assets overhang, which boosted the relative size of the financial sector across the continent, should be considered as the main source of excess finance to be rigidly constrained.","Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Spanò, M (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Varese, Italy.",,"Spanò, Marcello/AFN-7655-2022",,,,,,30,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Exploiting the responses of Japanese firms to recent policy reform, we find that the shortening of the allowable period for an examination request significantly increases both eventual and early requests, controlling for the blocking use of a pending patent application. This effect is stronger in technology areas with higher uncertainty. These results support the importance of uncertainty for an applicant and of ex-ante screening. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The first part emphasizes how mainstream, utility-based choice theory has eradicated time from the analysis, in contrast with the seminal contribution to the subjective theory of value proposed by Gossen in 1858. The limits of Becker's well-known approach to time-use are also analyzed. The second part opens with the presentation of an alternative approach based on activities, intended as productive processes allowing for pleasant time to be produced by consuming direct unpleasant time plus the indirect amount of unpleasant time equivalent to the market goods used up as inputs (Nistico, Production of (Pleasant) Time by Means of (Unpleasant) Time: Some Notes on Consumption Theory and Time Use, 2014). Finally, the approach is applied to an intertemporal context by drawing on Hicks's temporary equilibrium method. Scitovsky's distinction between defensive and creative activities is discussed in conclusion, suggesting that individuals might refrain from engaging in more skilled, time-consuming activities because of the attractiveness of a certain, higher present-period rate of return of less skilled, goods-intensive activities.","Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Creat & Motivat Econ Res Ctr, Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Nisticò, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Creat & Motivat Econ Res Ctr, Cassino, Italy.",s.nistico@unicas.it,"Nisticò, Sergio/AAG-6319-2021",,,,,,37,2,2,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 24,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,20158.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-8,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4BK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356897400001,0

To demonstrate our methodology, we take the example of the 1999 national income tax reform in Japan and evaluate it by estimating the SMCFs for changing marginal tax rates in different income brackets. We estimate the discrete choice model (DCM) of labor supply using a 1997 data set of Japanese households, and we use the estimates to generate the SMCFs with a DCM micro-simulation. We evaluate the simulated SMCFs with various distributional weights and find that the value of the SMCF for a 1 % increase in the marginal tax rate in any given income bracket decreases as we move across brackets from the bottom to the top. This finding suggests that the national government should have made the Japanese income tax system more progressive rather than less progressive as carried out in the 1999 reform. Our method is readily transferrable to tax reforms in other countries as well.","[Bessho, Shun-ichiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Hayashi, Masayoshi] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Keio University; University of Tokyo,"Bessho, S (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",bessho@econ.keio.ac.jp; hayashim@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hayashi, Masayoshi/A-2845-2015; Bessho, Shun-ichiro/S-1224-2019","Hayashi, Masayoshi/0000-0001-7455-8873; Bessho, Shun-ichiro/0000-0003-0667-4834","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780190, 24000003] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,56,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We compare welfare under the observed levels of migration to a no-migration counterfactual. In the long run, natives in countries that received a lot of migrationsuch as Canada or Australiaare better off due to greater product variety available in consumption and as intermediate inputs. In the short run, the impact of migration on average welfare in these countries is close to zero, while the skilled and unskilled natives tend to experience welfare changes of opposite signs. The remaining natives in countries with large emigration flowssuch as Jamaica or El Salvadorare also better off due to migration, but for a different reason: remittances.

We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are temporary, prepaid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while freeholds are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiration, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary data sets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100-year leaseholds are valued at more than 10% less than otherwise identical freeholds, implying discount rates below 2.6% for 100-year claims.

We then estimate a panel smooth transition growth equation that allows currency misalignment to exert nonlinear impacts on both economic growth and foreign currency-denominated debt dynamics.

One of the barriers to applying the prospect theory is that it is not designed to be applicable (Barberis, 2013). This study applies prospect theory to the selection of money back guarantee (MBG) contracts. When consumers can choose from a menu of MBG contracts they are basically trading off risk with price in a way that resembles a choice of lotteries with multidimensional outcomes. Our application, which integrates reference based utility models with elements of prospect theory and the disappointment model, helps in explaining the large premium attached to MBG contracts that cannot be explained by the expected utility framework. We further show that the combination of probability weighting with disappointment aversion appears to provide a better explanation for consumers' high valuation of MBGs relative to each one when measured separately. We empirically test how consumers' valuation of the MBG option is affected by MBG duration, variation in the likelihood of returns, and return conditions that affect consumers' return cost. Our approach can be applied to model choices of risk reduction mechanisms such as extended warranties, demonstrations, and sampling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Then, we estimate the provincial wage equation using a spatial panel model that controls for spatial heterogeneity and spatial interdependence as well as other regional characteristics.

In our study, community members pool resources to provide environmental education material for local schools. We find that voluntary contributions increase when democratically elected local authorities lead by example. The results are driven by two factors: (1) authorities, like other individuals, give more when they are called upon to lead than when they give in private, and (2) high leader contributions increase the likelihood that others follow. Both effects are stronger when authorities, as compared to randomly selected community members, lead by example. We explore two underlying sources of leadership influence. First, we provide evidence that the effect of a leader's contribution is not limited to signaling the value of the public good. Second, we examine how leader characteristics affect the likelihood that others follow. Specifically, our study shows that authority influence is driven by a combination of formal leadership status, observable characteristics, and the amount that authorities contribute when they give publicly before others.

It distinguishes between weak' and strong' zero lower bound traps. A strong trap corresponds to the liquidity trap. In a weak trap QE is expansionary but subject to diminishing returns. QE implicitly transfers income streams to the fiscal authority, generating fiscal drag that can eventually render QE contractionary. Proposals to exit QE by paying interest on reserves to check inflationary pressures is contradicted because paying interest constitutes an implicit tax cut. Instead, the paper suggests implementing asset based reserve requirements that deactivate liquidity by requiring banks hold increased reserves.","AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20009 USA",,"Palley, TI (通讯作者)，AFL CIO, 1913 S St NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",mail@thomaspalley.com,,,,,,,23,4,4,1,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2015,66.0,1,,,,,1,27,,10.1111/meca.12058,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AY5LZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347614900001,0

Two possible explanations are herding, corresponding to positive correlation in the behavior of different investors, or order splitting, corresponding to positive autocorrelation in the behavior of single investors. We investigate this using order flow data from the London Stock Exchange for which we have membership identifiers. By formulating models for herding and order splitting, as well as models for brokerage choice, we are able to overcome the distortion introduced by brokerage. On timescales of less than a few hours the persistence of order flow is overwhelmingly due to splitting rather than herding. We also study the properties of brokerage order flow and show that it is remarkably consistent both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, this relatively new field requires more attention to bring some benefit. Construction projects are facing a number of risks which have negative effects on project objects such as time, cost and quality. This study is based on findings of a questionnaire-based survey on risk management in construction projects in Pakistan, reporting the significance of different type of risk, ultimate responsibility for them and the effectiveness of some most common risk management techniques practiced in the industry. Two types of risk management techniques were considered: preventive techniques which can be used before the start of a project to manage risks that are anticipated during the project execution; and remedial techniques that are used during the execution phase once a risk has already occurred. The study revealed that financial issues for projects, accidents on site and defective design are the most significant risks affecting most of construction projects. As further reported, the contractor is responsible for management of most risks occurring at sites during the implementation phase, such as issues related to subcontractors, labour, machinery, availability of materials and quality, while the client is responsible for the risks such as financial issues, issues related to design documents, changes in codes and regulations, and scope of work. Further reported results of the analysis demonstrate that the production of proper schedule by getting updated data of the project and guidance from previous similar projects are the most effective preventive risk management techniques while close supervision and coordination within projects are the most effective remedial risk management techniques. It may be concluded that the most significant risks must be managed with greater effort to reduce/eliminate their effects on the project. As the study concludes, preparation of a proper schedule and good coordination during the implementation stage are very important as they may help project managers to focus on critical areas for better management of projects in Pakistan.","[Iqbal, Shahid; Ali, Ahsan] Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg, Fac Mat Sci & Technol, Freiberg, Germany; [Choudhry, Rafiq M.] King Faisal Univ, Coll Engn, Al Hafuf, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia; [Holschemacher, Klaus] Leipzig Univ Appl Sci HTWK Leipzig, Fac Civil Engn, D-04277 Leipzig, Germany; [Tamosaitiene, Jolanta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-2040 Vilnius, Lithuania",Technical University Freiberg; King Faisal University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tamosaitiene, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-2040 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jolanta.tamosaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Holschemacher, Klaus/I-8166-2019; Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/E-9278-2012","Holschemacher, Klaus/0000-0002-1497-3415; Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/0000-0003-4692-6821; Choudhry, Rafiq/0000-0003-4222-7222; Ali, Ahsan/0000-0001-5699-5957",,,,,35,88,99,12,288,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

It further analyzes the optimal weights and hedge ratios for dedicated gold-stock portfolio holdings and show how empirical results can be used to build effective diversification and hedging strategies. Several competing multivariate volatility models which are commonly-used in the finance literature (CCC-GARCH,DCC-GARCH, diagonal BEKK-GARCH, scalar BEKK-GARCH, and full-BEKK-GARCH) are also considered for comparison purpose. Our results show evidence of significant return and volatility cross effects between gold prices and stock prices in China, as well as the superiority of the VAR-GARCH model over the other multivariate GARCH specifications. In particular, past gold returns play a crucial role in explaining the dynamics of conditional return and volatility of Chinese stock market and should thus be accounted for when forecasting future stock returns. Our portfolio analysis suggests that adding gold to a portfolio of Chinese stocks improves its risk-adjusted return and helps to effectively hedge against stock risk exposure over time. Finally, when considering the period of the recent global financial crisis, we find that the gold asset serves as a safe haven for stocks in the Chinese stock markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It was quickly judged that additional measures were needed to stabilize the US economy. Beginning in December 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank initiated three rounds of unconventional monetary policies known as quantitative easing (QE). These policies were intended to reduce long-term interest rates when the short-term federal funds rates had reached the zero lower bound and could not become negative. It was argued that the lowering of longer-term interest rates would help the stock market and thus the wealth of consumers. This article carefully investigates three hypotheses: QE impacting long-term interest rates, QE impacting the stock market and QE impacting unemployment using a Markov regime switching methodology. We conclude that QE has contributed significantly to increases in the stock market but less significantly to long-term interest rate and unemployment.","[Bhar, Ramaprasad] Univ New S Wales, UNSW Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Malliaris, A.

In the model, individual heterogeneous investors interact with each other and with institutional devices which are an accounting system (related to the business firm) and a price system (related to the Share Exchange). These interactions provide mechanisms for transmission through which firm-specific (accounting signal) and market-driven (aggregate price) factors can act. A baseline simulation analysis assesses the financial market stability under three alternative accounting designs, namely two kinds of historical cost accounting regime and one kind of fair-value (mark-to-market) accounting regime. The former prove to better stabilize the financial system in terms of market volatility and exuberance in perfectly balanced conditions between speculative and fundamentalist beliefs and intentions. An evolutionary analysis is then developed by varying the relative degree of speculative attitudes between the two sides of the market. Historical cost accounting regimes further prove to make the financial system more resilient to speculative waves occurring at inter-individual level. Baseline findings are further corroborated through experimental analysis in twelve artificial financial systems. This mathematical institutional economic analysis has general implications for both designing accounting systems aimed at enhancing financial market stability and preventing procyclicality, and the study of accounting information process in the formation of share market prices over time.","CNRS ESCP Europe, F-75011 Paris, France",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Biondi, Y (通讯作者)，CNRS ESCP Europe, F-75011 Paris, France.",yuri.biondi@free.fr,"Biondi, Yuri/J-8820-2012","Biondi, Yuri/0000-0002-5545-5550",,,,,52,9,9,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) volatility model is the recommended model for forecasting volatility by the Riskmetrics group. For monthly data, the lambda parameter of the EWMA model is recommended to be set to 0.97. In this study, we empirically investigate if this is the optimal value of lambda in terms of forecasting volatility. Employing monthly realized volatility as the benchmark for testing the value of lambda, it is found that a value of lambda of 0.97 is far from optimal. The tests are robust to a variety of test statistics. It is further found that the optimal value of lambda is time varying and should be based upon recent historical data.

However, unless knowledge is shared among employees, organisations may fail to make the most of their intellectual capital. Of particular interest is the sharing of knowledge between employees belonging to different generational cohorts, since each of them possesses unique competencies. The study investigates how selected individual factors (i.e. willingness, motivation, communication, collaboration) impact upon the sharing of own knowledge with co-workers. In addition, it analyses the perceptions of the amount of knowledge shared through cross-generational mentoring relationships. A web-based survey was used to obtain the data from 268 employees. Findings indicate that while motivation and willingness significantly influence knowledge sharing, communication and collaboration exhibit insignificant relationships. Furthermore, respondents, both younger and older, report that the amount of knowledge received in mentoring processes is less than what is desired.","[Brcic, Ziva Jurisevic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Ctr EU Projects, Ika 51410, Opatija, Croatia; [Mihelic, Katarina Katja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Rijeka; University of Ljubljana,"Mihelic, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",Katja.mihelic@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,64,20,33,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Deposit euroization poses key challenges for monetary policy and financial sector supervision. On the one hand, it limits the effectiveness of monetary policy interventions. On the other hand, it increases financial sector fragility by exposing banks to currency risk or currency-induced credit risk. Policymakers disagree on whether countries in the region should tackle deposit euroization with 'dedollarization' policies or should rather strive to adopt the Euro as their legal tender. Assessing the potential effectiveness of 'dedollarization' policies requires a clear understanding of which households hold foreign currency deposits and why they do so. On the basis of survey data covering 16,375 households in ten countries in 2011 and 2012, we provide a comprehensive household-level analysis of deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. We examine how households' preferences for, and holding of, foreign currency deposits are related to individual expectations about monetary conditions and network effects. We also examine to what extent monetary expectations and deposit euroization are the legacy of past financial crises or the outflow of current policies and institutions in the region. Our findings suggest that deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe can be partly tackled by prudent monetary and economic decisions by today's policymakers. The preferences of households for Euro deposits are partly driven by their distrust in the stability of their domestic currency, which in turn is related to their assessment of current policies and institutions. However, our findings also suggest that a stable monetary policy may not be sufficient to deal with the hysteresis of deposit euroization across the region. First, we confirm that the holding of foreign currency deposits has become a 'habit' in the region. Second, we find that deposit euroization is still strongly influenced by households' experiences of financial crises in the 1990s. Our findings question the effectiveness of supply side interventions (e.g. bank regulation) or demand side interventions (e.g. local currency capital market development) in de-euroizing household savings. First, we show that deposit euroization is largely demand driven. Second, we show that households already have access to a broad range of savings products in local currency.","[Brown, Martin] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; Oesterreich Nationalbank, Vienna, Austria",University of St Gallen; Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Brown, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.brown@unisg.ch,,,,,,,39,14,14,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We assume that the principal cannot observe the agents' effort choices; however, agents can observe each other and can be contractually required to make observation reports to the principal. Observation reports, if truthful, can serve as a monitoring instrument to discipline the agents. However, reports are cheap talk so that it is also possible for agents to collude, i.e., where they shirk, earn rents, and report otherwise to the principal. The main result of the paper constructs a class of collusion-proof contracts with two properties. First, equilibrium payoffs to both the principal and the agents approach their first-best benchmarks as the discount factor tends to unity. These payoff bounds apply to all subgame perfect equilibria in the game induced by the contract. Second, while equilibria themselves depend on the discount factor, the contract that induces these equilibria is independent of the discount factor.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Chandrasekher, M (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",madhav.chandrasekher@asu.edu,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,13,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

EVIDENCE FROM DEMAND FOR AUXILIARY HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTITUTION; CHILDREN; MISDIAGNOSIS; METROPOLITAN; MANAGEMENT; EPILEPSY,"Autism is a development disorder that has increased in prevalence from 0.5 to 14.7 per 1,000 children over 1970-2010. Using annual wages and provider counts from the American Community Survey and information from 21 regional development centers in California, we estimate the labor demand for auxiliary health providers. We focus on this subset of providers because, unlike physicians and psychologists who can diagnose autism, these workers cannot induce their own demand. If the incidence of autism is increasing independently of other mental disorders, then the demand for auxiliary health providers should increase, leading to higher wages and labor supply. Otherwise, the increase in autism diagnosis is merely displacing other mental disorders. We find that a 100% increase in autism cases increases the wages of auxiliary health workers over non-autism health occupations by 8-11% and the number of providers by 9-14%. Furthermore, we find that one of every three new autism diagnoses is merely supplanting mental retardation diagnoses, but does not displace other mental disorders. These estimates suggest that at least part of the increase in autism diagnoses, about 50-65%, reflects an increase in the true prevalence of the disorder.

By almost all measures, there has been a remarkable increase in innovative activity in China. In fact, in 2011, China accounted for roughly 25% of global patent applications. However, several indirect measures suggest that the quality of this newly created Chinese IP is not (yet) world-class. For example, relative to residents of other major Asian countries and the USA, Chinese residents tend to file IP applications in foreign markets at a much lower rate. Similarly, the ratio of royalty payments earned by Chinese residents to the number of patents granted to them is fairly low by international standards. Finally, the ratio of patent to utility model applications (typically granted for relatively minor innovations) in China is also relatively small.","[Geng, Difei; Saggi, Kamal] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Saggi, K (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, VU Stn B 351828,2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",kamal.saggi@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,14,11,11,5,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The innovation types considered are the Gaussian, Student's t, alpha-stable, classical tempered stable (CTS), normal tempered stable (NTS) and generalized hyperbolic (GH) distributions. In calm periods of decreasing volatility, MLE and QMLE produce near identical performance in forecasting value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). In more volatile periods, QMLE can actually produce superior performance for CTS, NTS and a-stable innovations. While the t-ARMAGARCH model has the fewest number of VaR violations, rejections by the Kupeic and Berkowitz tests suggest excessively large forecasted losses.

Households of various wealth and earnings levels search for goods at different intensities and pay different prices in differently crowded markets. Increases in savings arising from a financial shock that tightens the borrowing limit trigger a recession via two channels: 1) the reduction in the consumption of goods that are subject to search frictions reduces productivity and output: 2) because the poorest households are more affected by the shock, consumption tilts toward the richest households, causing an additional reduction in output and productivity. We model fixed prices in a competitive search environment and show how price rigidities dramatically exacerbate the recession. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Problematic and, as a result, rare application of quantitative risk assessment tools in the public sector determines the relevance of systemization and facilitation of techniques, which would allow increasing accuracy of Risk assessment as well as efficiency and transparency of public finance management. The purpose of this article is to analyze the peculiarities of Risk in PIPs and to find the PDs (probability distributions) that best enable to assess the Risk in PIPs more specifically. Summarizing the scientific literature, it was revealed that, due to a complex of problems, risk assessment based on historical data gives place to the qualitative tools such as personal expertise, which is prevailing in practice. However, under the circumstances analyzed in the article, the application of historical data allows getting more accurate results, and the public sector, despite the lack of experience in comparison with the private one, has more advantages in this case. The performed case study enabled to present a methodology of how to systemize data for the assessment of Risk in PIPs. The peculiarities of Risk were analyzed in groups (PIP groups), their classification was based on PIP accounting plan of long-term assets in Lithuania. The findings of the article showed the difficulties of the public sector to ensure sufficient financing as well as the problems to manage Risk in PIPs. The case study disclosed the inability of the so called traditional PDs to accurately describe this tendency of success of the public sector to implement PIP within the estimated budget, while the Loglogistics and its parameters were tested as the most suitable PD to assess the Risk not in a general case, but also in different PIP groups.","[Jasiukevicius, Linas; Vasiliauskaite, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Jasiukevicius, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",linas.jasiukevicius@gmail.com; asta.vasiliauskaite@ktu.lt,,,,,,,46,3,3,1,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The study reveals the emergence of two interrelated manifestations of the financialization process in Estonia in the form of increased international inequality in favor of foreign actors, accruing from cross-border investment activity, and higher debt burden of the household sector against the accumulation of savings in the economy as a whole. Institutionally, these developments have been supported by the embeddedness of the Washington Consensus policies. Given the lack of intervention in the economy by means of either prudential capital account controls or specific foreign direct investment policies, the result has been a heavy reliance on foreign capital in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors. Furthermore, the privatization process and recurring banking failures associated with the transition process have created a particular historical context in terms of institutional arrangements and idiosyncratic elements that laid the groundwork for deteriorating internal and external imbalances in the economy.","[Juuse, Egert] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Juuse, E (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",,"Juuse, Egert/ABE-6752-2021","Juuse, Egert/0000-0002-9949-1289",European Union [266800],European Union(European Union (EU)),"Egert Juuse is junior research fellow at the Ragnar Nurkse School of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology.

Throughout the world, corporate sector realised the importance of IC during the 1990s' and started to utilise IC to gain competitive advantage over competitors. Globally public sector too, is under continuous pressure from various stakeholders for performance improvement. Public sector, just like corporate sector is also utilising IC in various ways and it is being argued that IC as a strategic resource can also help in improving the performance of this sector. However, research on IC in public sector is still very scarce, and especially, in the context of developing countries, almost non-existent. Literature suggests that IC is currently in the third wave (stage) of its development. The third wave of IC research advocates the complexity and idiosyncratic nature of IC and stresses on researching 'IC in action' i.e., intellectual capital practices and managerial implications rather than measuring it. This theoretical paper aims to explore IC phenomenon in the knowledge intensive public sector organisations of a developing country (Pakistan), keeping in view the third wave of IC. It raises the issues of IC role in value creation or destruction in the public sector and practices associated with the IC, in organisations which do not have IC management strategies in black and white however, through their practices these organisations are managing it. It also develops a theoretical framework which proposes to study the IC practices of the public sector organisations through constructivism, and performative IC lenses in order to grasp the complexity of conceptualising the IC, particular nature, failure of generalisation of the IC grand theories, and development of the third stage of IC. This theoretical framework focuses on understanding the phenomenon and its role in public sector organisations. The framework contributes towards the third wave of IC research in the specific context of public sector organisations in a developing country and by adopting an appropriate methodology, the practices and implications of IC can be better comprehended through this framework. This can also be useful in developing IC management strategies in the public sector organisations.","[Khan, Awais Alam; Nouman, Muhammad] Inst Management Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Khan, AA (通讯作者)，Inst Management Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan.",awais.alam@imsciences.edu.pk; muhammad.nouman@imsciences.edu.pk,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,181,188,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600022,0

With the first reform the economic authorities wanted to reposition Mexico in the international division of labor. With the second one they aimed at attracting capital inflows and modernizing the banking sector. Resolute commitment to drastic trade and to financial liberalization brought praise from a large part of the press and from international organizations, especially during the years from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s when these two reforms were fully implemented. They were therefore greatly surprised when at the end of 1994 Mexico went into a deep crisis. The objective of this work is to study this period, to argue that the results of those reforms did not deserve to be praised, and to explain why the crisis could have been anticipated. Mexico's experience is important in itself but we can also learn a lot from its positive results as well as its shortcomings. This is why an analytical reflection on the reasons for its failure to achieve the expected benefits is still important today.","[Lopez, Julio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"López, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,30,1,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In this paper, we show that unless the degree of product differentiation and the degree of importance of the private firm's relative performance are low, the quantity competition can analytically become the unique equilibrium market structure on the basis of the dominant strategies of the public firm and the private firm when the degree of importance of firm l's relative performance is sufficiently high. This result contrasts strikingly with that obtained in a standard mixed duopoly composed of one social welfare-maximizing public firm and one absolute profit maximizing private firm. In addition, even in the area wherein both the degree of product differentiation and the degree of the private firm's relative performance are sufficiently low, through numerical simulations, the quantity competition tends to become the unique equilibrium market structure when the degree of importance of the private firm's relative performance is sufficiently high, whereas the price competition tends to become the unique equilibrium market structure when the degree of importance of the private firm's relative performance is sufficiently low.

The latter has long argued that Keynesian fundamental uncertainty is best viewed as an axiomatic ontological condition of nonergodicity of a system. This influential view is challenged by O'Donnell who favors an epistemological behavioral perspective based on people having imperfect knowledge. Whereas for Davidson it is Keynes overthrowing the axiom of ergodicity that is fundamental, for O'Donnell it is Keynes overthrowing the axiom of perfect knowledge. We shall find that both parties make valid points in this debate, but further clarification is needed. Both accept that while Keynes never used the term ergodicity in his writings, he did discuss problems of nonhomogeneity of data when critiquing the econometric methodology of Jan Tinbergen. While it is known that a stationary series may be nonergodic, such as a limit cycle, it is much less well known and not commented on by either of them that a nonstationary series may be ergodic. Furthermore, while a nonstationary series must be nonhomogeneous, a nonhomogeneous series may be stationary under proper transformations such as first differencing. Deeper connections of the development of ergodic theory and chaos theory and this link to the debate over fundamental uncertainty are also discussed.","[Rosser, J.

It will then examine the relationship between these variables and research performance to determine the drivers and barriers of effective research and knowledge generation in the UAE. The total population of researchers in the UAE will be compiled through publically available information sources, such as University Websites and Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research Databases. The total identified population will then be sampled electronically, with data being statistically analysed to determine the relations between research performance and key individual and organizational characteristics.

In this paper, a form of textual critique and philosophical inquiry is proposed, the deconstruction approach, advocated by the French thinker Jacques Derrida. Established hierarchical polarities populating standard economic analysis are identified, interpreted, criticised, and questioned. Neoclassical-driven economics views disequilibrium as a fall from equilibrium, whilst subordinating monetary dynamics, nature, and the climate to the prevailing importance of the productive economy. The rethinking of economics for improved sustainability governance would need to start from the premise of viewing the economy as a dynamic social construct, subjected to contextual conditions and historicity. Money, the non-human natural world, and our climate need to play more defining temporal and differential roles in economic analysis. The paper encourages reflexivity in economics research.

Based on wavelet quantile regression analysis, we find systematic positive asymmetric price transmission (APT) inefficiencies. We conclude that there is a very high propensity for mortgage lenders to directly increase its customers' mortgage interest rates subsequently to an increase in its borrowing costs. However, after a corresponding borrowing cost decrease, the same mortgage lenders are very slow to decrease its customers' mortgage rates. These positive coefficients for so-called APT effects are found in all Scandinavian countries, even if the coefficients for Norway were not statistically significant. Wavelet quantile regression analysis, with a focus on the relevant higher percentiles, is easily motivated since the mortgage rates are adjusted very infrequently. Moreover, wavelet decomposition allows a robust analysis at different time frequency scales, while simultaneously controlling for nonstationary trends, autocorrelation and structural breaks. Except for the still positive but yet insignificant and inconclusive coefficients for Norway, the result is very clear-cut. Regardless of which wavelet scaling decomposition or quantile coefficient that is studied - positive APT effects are clearly identified and confirmed on the Scandinavian mortgage market.","[Sjolander, Par; Shukur, Ghazi; Mansson, Kristofer; Kekezi, Orsa] Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Shukur, Ghazi] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Mansson, Kristofer] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Gothenburg, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Linnaeus University; University of Gothenburg,"Sjölander, P (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Jonkoping, Sweden.",par.sjolander@jibs.hj.se,"Kekezi, Orsa/AAF-4165-2020",,Handelsbanken; Nordea bank; Compricer,Handelsbanken; Nordea bank; Compricer,"We would like to gratefully acknowledge the data and support from Handelsbanken, Nordea bank and Compricer.",,49,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To analyze theoretical background of expenditure management process in households with the aim to identify reasons compromising the management efficiency and the ways of their handling. Methodology/methods. Comparative analysis of scientific literature, statistical data analysis, cross-disciplinary approach integrating psychology and economics, Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, vector algebra, case-study based testing. Scientific aim. To justify theoretically a new approach to household expenditure management containing formal pre-purchase procedures used to match the value of goods/services purchased with the specific consumer's preferences by applying value decomposition technique. Findings. Decomposed value components better than aggregate value reflect the ability of good/service to satisfy various complex needs of the consumer, both basic (physiological) and those purely psychological from higher stages of the Maslow pyramid of needs, e.g. esteem and self-actualization. Decomposition gives the possibility to quantitatively evaluate and compare them. Results of case-studies carried out have proved validity of the approach and its potential in being applied as a planning tool in managing household's expenditure. Conclusions. Decryption of aggregate value of goods and services by decomposing it into components reflecting the hierarchy of consumer's needs creates a platform for development alternative approach to expenditure management in households, less dependent on influence of various subjective, intuition based factors. This approach should yield to reduction of spontaneous spending, give the possibility to harmonize not only total/aggregate consumption with the income, but also to find a balance between items in the bunch of products/services purchased, thus preventing an unbalanced (excessive or insufficient) allocation of funds.","[Taujanskaite, Kamile; Rutkauskas, Aleksandras Vytautas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Milcius, Eugenijus] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Taujanskaite, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",kamile.taujanskaite@vgtu.lt; eugenijus.milcius@ktu.lt; aleksandras.rutkauskas@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,86,2,2,0,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The model consists of several sophisticated and established approaches and can be regarded as a periodic VAR-TARCH with wind power, solar power, and load as influences on the time series.

Research has focused attention on the cost structure of interest rates and, more recently, on macroeconomic and macro-institutional factors. While the cost structure is probably the most important determinant of interest rates, other factors also matter. In addition to other important results that usually validate the empirical literature, this paper finds that microcredit interest rates respond positively to corruption. The analysis shows that there is asymmetry between the effects of corruption, depending on whether or not theMFIs are regulated. While corruption has a positive and significant impact on interest rates of unregulated MFIs, it has a negligible impact on interest rates of regulated MFIs.","[Al-Azzam, Moh'd] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Al-Azzam, M (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",malazzam@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,,27,7,8,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

It argues that this relationship becomes fully evident only if one considers intermediate levels of aggregation, and in particular stages of production within each industrial sector and their interdependence across sectors. To illustrate this, the paper introduces the concept of structural liquidity, which denotes material funds that are endogenously formed within the productive system before one considers the provision of liquidity by means of money. Structural liquidity is analyzed by combining (i) the representation of the productive system as an arrangement of fabrication stages sequentially related in time; and (ii) the representation of the productive system as a set of interdependent industrial sectors. The analysis identifies the structural liquidity problem as the need to satisfy both a viability condition (deriving from sectoral interdependencies) and a full employment condition (deriving from the sequencing of fabrication stages). The analysis highlights previously unexplored trade-offs, which have wide-ranging implications for monetary and liquidity policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Firms have two options as to how to serve a foreign market: (i) to export products to that market, paying a trade cost; and (ii) to produce there by engaging in FDI, incurring a fixed cost. We find that the range of parameters under which firms choose to export rather than to engage in FDI is greater when firms invest in capacity than when they do not. This contrasts with the result obtained when firms invest in R&D, when their investment encourages them to engage in FDI. There are cases where the mode of foreign expansion preferred by firms does not maximize joint welfare. We find that governments can get firms to adopt the right mode of foreign expansion by discouraging the other mode with a high enough fixed tax or fee.","[Dong, Quan] South China Normal Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain",South China Normal University; University of Basque Country,"Dong, Q (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,"Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011",,"Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2012-32299, ECO2015-66803-P]; Basque Government [IT1124-16]; University of the Basque Country [EHU14/05]",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country,"We would like to thank two referees for helpful comments.

This paper investigates whether being exposed to bullying in the workplace increases long-term sickness absence. We analyze employees from a selection of workplaces from The Bullying Cohort Study conducted in Denmark in 2006. The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain exposure to bullying and that exposure to bullying is associated with negative immediate self-reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. This suggests that men and women have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that men are twice as likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A central result is that the extent of inequality is determined entirely by two factors. The first factor, household exposure to idiosyncratic investment risk, increases inequality. The second factor, cross-sectional mean reversion of household wealth, decreases inequality. We show that economic mobility is decreasing in inequality and increasing in mean reversion, a result that is consistent with recent empirical observations about the geographic variation in mobility that exists both domestically and internationally. Our approach allows us to examine the implications of increased market completeness in the form of a risk-sharing subgroup of households. We show that a risk-sharing subgroup rises or falls in the equilibrium wealth distribution depending on the level of inequality, and that its presence raises welfare and the rate of wealth accumulation for all households in the economy.

Neo- Samuelsonians have argued that Sen's arguments against RPT are innocuous, in particular once it is acknowledged that RPT does not assume away the existence of motivations or other latent psychological or cognitive processes. Sen's claims that preferences and choices need to be distinguished and that external factors need to be taken into account to analyze the act of choice then appear to be irrelevant. However, while it is true that contemporary revealed preference theory (CRPT) partially evades Sen's critique, I show that the latter is still relevant outside the restricted areas of consumer choice and market dynamics. In particular, Sen's views regarding the importance of incomplete preferences and the multiplicity of levels of agency can hardly be integrated into the framework of CRPT. This is a significant limit, given the imperialistic claims of some of the proponents of the latter.","[Hedoin, Cyril] Univ Reims, REGARDS Res Ctr, 57B Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, REGARDS Res Ctr, 57B Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,55,9,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

To this end we estimate, using Japanese data, a financial accelerator model in which the balance sheet conditions of entrepreneurs in a goods-producing sector and those of a financial intermediary affect macroeconomic activity. We find that shocks to the balance sheets of the two sectors have been quantitatively playing important role in macroeconomic fluctuations by affecting lending rates and aggregate investments. Their impacts are prominent in particular during financial crises. Shocks to the entrepreneurs' balance sheets have played a key role in lowering investment in the bubble burst during the early 1990s and in the global financial crisis during the late 2000s.

We extend the model of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) to endogenize the effort firms allocate to learning. This effort choice depends on both the degree to which firms enter export markets and the extent to which products are differentiated across producers. Using a firm-level dataset from China's manufacturing industries, we implement propensity score matching methods to test the model's predictions. Our results indicate that the degree of export participation is positively correlated with TFP improvements. Simultaneously, we empirically verify that firms exporting less differentiated products experience faster TFP growth than those exporting more differentiated products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A Heckman two-stage selection model is employed to investigate two separate decisions: mortgage holding and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios among mortgage holders. Results indicate that financial sophistication is positively associated with carrying a mortgage and higher LTV ratios.

It shows that the stationarity of the urbanization level varies across different regions where urbanization levels are convergent mainly in the middle-and low-income regions in China, while the high-income regions' urbanization is divergent.

More recently, neuroeconomic work has sought to predict consumer choice using brain activations witnessed in non-choice, visual appraisals. This paper combines these two emerging strains of inquiry. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data observed when consumers view a quality-differentiated food product labeled with different attributes, we seek to determine the predictive validity of the random utility model (RUM) often used in economic studies of consumer choice. Our fMRI data consist of changes in blood flow to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (a brain region previously associated with value formation) observed when people saw low price and high labels and labels indicating high or low quality. We couple the fMRI data with data on 28 non-hypothetical choices made by each participant, which pitted higher priced, higher quality good vs. a lower priced, lower quality good. We find little evidence of a systematic difference in activation in brain areas thought to be associated with value formation when viewing high vs. low levels of attributes (prices and quality). However, differences in neural blood flow across participants related to quality (but not price) is significantly related to subsequent consumer choice both in- and out-of-sample, providing some qualified neuroeconomic support for the attribute-based RUM.

An indicator measuring the rate of Reconquest reveals a heavily negative effect on current income differences across the Spanish provinces. A main intervening factor in the impact the Reconquest has had is the concentration of economic and political power in a few hands, excluding large segments of the population from access to economic opportunities when Spain entered the industrialization phase. The timing of the effect is consistent with this argument. A general implication of our analysis is that large frontier expansions may favor a political equilibrium among the colonizing agents that is biased toward the elite, creating the conditions for an inegalitarian society, with negative consequences for long-term economic development.","[Oto-Peralias, Daniel] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, Ctr Responsible Banking & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Romero-Avila, Diego] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",University of St Andrews; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Romero-Avila, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",dop2@st-andrews.ac.uk; dromtor@upo.es,"Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017","Oto-Peralias, Daniel/0000-0001-8773-6835",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-13357]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35430]; Andalusian Council for Innovation and Science [SEJ-4546],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Council for Innovation and Science,"Diego Romero-Avila would like to dedicate this article to the memory of his father, Pedro Jose Romero de Avila Aguilar, for encouragement and support throughout his career.

Products with attributes that do not pass the cut-off values are either not being considered by the individual or are greatly discounted. This study provides new evidence on consumers' heterogeneous use of attribute cut-offs with a unique focus on the relationship with consumer involvement, a key component in consumer choice theory. Behavioral data from an online choice experiment on beef steak employing shelf simulations are combined with questions defining respondents' attribute cut-off values and their validated Personal Involvement Inventory (PII). Evidence from the analysis indicates that consumers who are highly involved are more likely to exhibit attribute cut-off values and are less likely to violate their cut-off values. Further investigation using a latent class model identifies several key consumer segments (e.g., a price sensitive group) based on their choice behavior and reveals that the relationship between involvement, cut-off use and cut-off violations is not uniform across consumer segments.

This paper presents simple theoretical conditions that guarantee the existence of these paths in a general equilibrium model with sticky prices.

A quantification of the model which combines a real shock a la Hayashi and Prescott (2002) with a simultaneous sunspot that deanchors inflation expectations matches the main empirical features of the Japanese deflationary process during the lost decade.

Direct links with Europe are completely ruled out. All these would allude to a very limited susceptibility of these EA economies to shocks in the US and Europe, barring a global economic crisis of catastrophic proportions.

As territorial enterprises they define and enforce the rules and terms that apply to everybody, whether citizen or alien, who resides and/or operates within their jurisdictional boundaries. As club enterprises, they define and enforce the rules and terms of membership in the respective polity. The focus of this paper is on the implications of the fact that exit' means something different when one looks at governments' role as territorial enterprises (exit = leaving the territory) in contrast to their role as club enterprises (exit = giving up one's membership status/citizenship).","[Vanberg, Viktor J.] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Vanberg, Viktor J.] Walter Eucken Inst Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Vanberg, VJ (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.;Vanberg, VJ (通讯作者)，Walter Eucken Inst Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.",vanberg@eucken.de,,,,,,,46,3,3,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

It is first to evaluate the comparative performance of ten MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries according to GDP growth and stock market return indicators using the non parametric stochastic dominance approach. We will then use a multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) model to investigate the shock transmission from the most performing country to other dominated countries. Results, over the period from June 2005 to December 2013, show that the dominance of MENA countries differs across indicators. Qatar and Morocco are respectively the most performing countries according to GDP growth and stock market return. Furthermore, the GDP growth response to Qatar GDP growth shock is statistically significant for all countries while, the stock market response to Morocco stock market shock is insignificant in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. The response time of stock market return is also short when it is significant. Finally, this finding shows that the GDP growth dominance has the greater effect than the stock market dominance.

We investigate how culture matters presenting evidence of significant interactions between individualism and formal legal and political institutions. Individualism has a greater impact on entry regulation in societies with democratic political institutions or a common law tradition. This outcome is consistent with the idea that culture influences social preference for regulation, and political and legal institutions determine the degree to which those preferences are expressed as policy outcomes.

We apply a Bayesian motivated estimation framework, which treats the available information for each farm type as a random variable in the mathematical programming model. The comparison of the three approaches with the naive baseline demonstrates that the incorporation of farm structural change has an effect in the area, herd size and economic size unit distribution in the farms types. These results highlight the need of incorporating farm structural adjustments in the ex-ante policy modelling exercises assessing the Common Agricultural Policy. (C) 2016 Society for Policy Modeling.

We exploit a reform in the English National Health Service to assess the effect of removing constraints on patient choice. We estimate a demand model that explicitly captures the removal of the choice constraints imposed on patients. We find that, post-removal, patients became more responsive to clinical quality. This led to a modest reduction in mortality and a substantial increase in patient welfare. The elasticity of demand faced by hospitals increased substantially post-reform and we find evidence that hospitals responded to the enhanced incentives by improving quality. This suggests greater choice can raise quality.","[Gaynor, Martin] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Gaynor, Martin; Propper, Carol] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Gaynor, Martin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Propper, Carol] Imperial Coll London, Sch Business, Tanaka Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Propper, Carol] CEPR, London, England; [Seiler, Stephan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Bristol; National Bureau of Economic Research; Imperial College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stanford University,"Gaynor, M (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Gaynor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.;Gaynor, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mgaynor@cmu.edu; C.Propper@imperial.ac.uk; sseiler@stanford.edu,,"Seiler, Stephan/0000-0001-8636-1840",ESRC [ES/J023108/1]; Department of Health under the HREP; ESRC [ES/J023108/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J023108/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department of Health under the HREP; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Gaynor: Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, University of Bristol, and NBER (e-mail: mgaynor@cmu.edu); Propper: Business School, Imperial College London, Tanaka Building, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, UK, University of Bristol, and CEPR (e-mail: C.Propper@imperial.ac.uk); Seiler: Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 (e-mail: sseiler@stanford.edu).

The transfers differ from other programs in that they are explicitly unconditional, large, and concentrated in time. We randomized at both the village and household levels; furthermore, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife versus husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer versus monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (US$404 PPP versus US$1,525 PPP). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from $158 PPP to $193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, whereas lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on economic outcomes and psychological well-being.","[Haushofer, Johannes] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Busara Ctr Behav Econ, Nairobi, Kenya",Princeton University,"Haushofer, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,NIH [R01AG039297]; Cogito Foundation [R-116/10],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Cogito Foundation,"We are deeply grateful to Faizan Diwan, Conor Hughes, and James Reisinger for outstanding project management and data analysis.

The model endogenously determines not only the timing of investments but also their capacities, the degree of overlap between the initial and the subsequent innovations, and the way the competitors resolve the dispute. It shows that the firms' R&D competition in the burgeoning market is more likely to entail a lawsuit and distinctly differentiated products, while they easily agree on cross licensing to utilize each other's works in the slow-growing market, leaving little difference between the products. From the perspective of public policy, it is clarified that the policy on patent scope cannot yield the first-best result in terms of the speed of innovation, and the welfare analysis shows that social welfare is higher when the conflict is settled via cross licensing. However, the weak protection on patent rights, which is shown to encourage cross licensing, does not always guarantee the highest level of social welfare since it weakens the leader's bargaining power in the negotiation, leading to fewer advanced products with higher prices.","[Jeon, Haejun] Osaka Univ, Ctr Math Modeling & Data Sci, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Jeon, H (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Ctr Math Modeling & Data Sci, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",jeon@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Jeon, Haejun/AAU-7413-2021","Jeon, Haejun/0000-0001-7297-9316",,,,,38,5,6,6,61,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

With this in mind, this paper investigates the need for a role of firms' backward-looking behavior in accounting for inflation persistence after trend inflation is eliminated from the inflation rate. Our findings are twofold. First, the observed low contemporaneous correlation and reverse dynamic correlation between the output gap and the inflation gap cannot be replicated by a standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model incorporating the purely forward-looking New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) and trend inflation. When the NKPC is replaced with its hybrid version, the DSGE model does provide a reasonable description of the observed joint dynamic correlation between the output and the inflation gaps. Second, the second moments of key macroeconomic variables are best explained by the hybrid NKPC emphasizing both firms' forward-and their backward-looking behaviors. These results dispute the view that trend inflation is able to replace the role of firms' backward-looking behavior in generating inflation persistence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the power plant, natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel than coal, but uncertainties exist in the amount of methane leakage occurring upstream in the extraction and production of natural gas. At higher leakage levels, the additional methane emissions could offset the carbon dioxide emissions reduction benefit of switching from coal to natural gas. This analysis uses the MARKAL linear optimization model to compare the carbon emissions profiles and system-wide global warming potential of the U.S. energy system over a series of model runs in which the power sector is required to meet a specific carbon dioxide reduction target across a number of scenarios in which the availability of natural gas changes. Scenarios are run with carbon dioxide emissions and a range of upstream methane emission leakage rates from natural gas production along with upstream methane and carbon dioxide emissions associated with production of coal and oil. While the system carbon dioxide emissions are reduced in most scenarios, total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions show an increase in scenarios in which natural gas prices remain low and, simultaneously, methane emissions from natural gas production are higher.

Even when spillovers exist, under certain conditions the local government could still reach the optimum provision of the local public good, otherwise there is under-provision. Secondly, relaxing the non-excludability assumption, provision efficiency could be achieved if the local governments collect the service fees based on the neighboring community user's net marginal willingness to pay. If not, the service fee mechanism would not always be able to eliminate the preexisting allocation inefficiency and could sometimes lead to increased inefficiency due to overprovision of the public good.","[Ou, Jiun-Nan] Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Adm, 321,Sec 1,Jinan Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Business,"Ou, JN (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Adm, 321,Sec 1,Jinan Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",olio@ntub.edu.tw,,,,,,,14,0,1,0,11,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

This paper looks at how DACA affects DACA-eligible immigrants' labor market outcomes. I use a difference-in-differences design for unauthorized immigrants near the criteria cutoffs for DACA eligibility. I find DACA increases the likelihood of working by increasing labor force participation and decreasing the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. I also find DACA increases the income of unauthorized immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution. I find little evidence that DACA affects the likelihood of attending school. Using these estimates, DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment. If the effects of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) are similar to DACA, then DAPA could potentially move over 250,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.

This paper addresses the determinants of school attendance using unique household survey data for two Melanesian economies rarely reported in the international literature: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. There is a high degree of heterogeneity in the results across both gender and location. The main findings are that as children get older, they are less likely to attend school as are children that work either inside or outside the home. School fees act as a major deterrent for sending children to school, even though governments and international donors have taken significant steps to make primary education free. Finally, community programs that aim at increasing school attendance have been successful, particularly for girls and children in remote areas.

Our estimates are based on a panel of 18 OECD countries covering the period 1980-2013. For the full panel, the average demand regime is found to be wage led.

Then, by conducting multivariate time-series analyses, this paper shows empirically to what extent differences in financial structure between Japan and the U.S. have affected the relationship between unconventional monetary policy and aggregate bank lending.

We find that educational persistence, as measured by the regression coefficient of father's (mother's) education as a predictor of daughter's education, has declined. However, the correlation between educational attainment of daughters and fathers (mothers), another commonly used measure of persistence, suggests only a marginal decline. Further we decompose the intergenerational correlation. We also find that the probability of a daughter attaining senior secondary or above education (top end of educational distribution) is not only positively associated with father's (mother's) education levels but the gaps in those probabilities have not declined over time. Similarly, there is no convergence over time in the probability of a daughter attaining senior secondary or above education with the same level of father's (mother's) education for daughters belonging to Higher Hindu Castes and disadvantaged groups such as Other Backward Castes or Scheduled Castes/Tribes. Although conditional on having same educated fathers, sons are more likely to achieve senior secondary or above education in each cohort compared to daughters, the gap in those probabilities has declined over time.","[Azam, Mehtabul] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Azam, Mehtabul] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Azam, M (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;Azam, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",mazam@okstate.edu,,,,,,,25,9,9,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper provides an alternative to that longstanding hypothesis. Motivated by new cross-country facts and evidence from Brazilian municipalities, we hypothesize that many democratic developing countries might invest less in public education spending because poor decisive voters prefer the government to allocate resources elsewhere. One possible explanation is that low-income voters could instead favor redistributive programs that increase their incomes in the short run, such as cash transfers. To test for this possibility, we design and implement an experimental survey and an incentivized choice experiment in Brazil. The findings from both interventions support our hypothesis.","[Bursztyn, Leonardo] UCLA Anderson, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Bursztyn, L (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bursztyn@ucla.edu,,,Jorge Paulo Lemann Fellowship,Jorge Paulo Lemann Fellowship,"I thank Nicola Gennaioli and four anonymous referees for comments and suggestions.

The intention is to keep unemployed job seekers attached to the labour market and to increase their job-finding probabilities. To analyze the unemployment dynamics of job seekers with and without marginal employment, we consider an inflow sample into unemployment and estimate multivariate duration models. While we do not find any significant impact on the job finding probability in a model with homogeneous effects, models allowing for time-varying coefficients indicate a decreased job finding probability of marginal employment at the beginning of the unemployment spell and an increased job finding probability for the long-term unemployed. Our results suggest that job seekers with marginal employment find more stable post-unemployment jobs, and we find some evidence that the relationship between marginal employment and wages and employment stability varies with respect to skill levels, sector and labor market tightness.

Applying a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of collateral constraints with asset reallocation to Japan, I find that public policy shocks account well for the business cycle dynamics. In particular, taxes on land holdings of households mimic the impact of a housing preference shock, and if volatile enough, can trigger large asset price fluctuations. However, in the absence of volatility, the impact on prices is intrinsically linked to the persistence of shocks. Dependence on fixed assets such as real estate to secure collateral-based financing significantly amplifies the effect of initial shocks on the real macro aggregates. The financial accelerator works through the redistribution channel, shifting a large fraction of the collateral between constrained and unconstrained agents in response to an external stimuli.","[Chakraborty, Suparna] Univ San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA",University of San Francisco,"Chakraborty, S (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",schakraborty2@usfca.edu,,,Faculty Development Fund of the University of San Francisco,Faculty Development Fund of the University of San Francisco,"I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. William A.

This paper presents and compares three methods for computing Markov-perfect optimal policies in stochastic nonlinear business cycle models. The methods considered include value function iteration, generalized Euler equations, and parameterized shadow prices. In the context of a business cycle model in which a fiscal authority chooses government spending and income taxation optimally, although lacking the ability to commit, we show that the solutions obtained using value function iteration and generalized Euler equations are somewhat more accurate than that obtained using parameterized shadow prices. Among these three methods, we show that value function iteration can be applied easily, even to environments that include a risk-sensitive fiscal authority and/or inequality constraints on government spending. We show that the risk-sensitive fiscal authority lowers government spending and income taxation, reducing the disincentive to accumulate wealth that households face.","[Dennis, Richard; Kirsanova, Tatiana] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Dennis, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Main Bldg,Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",richard.dennis@glasgow.ac.uk,"Dennis, Richard/AAZ-5973-2020","Kirsanova, Tatiana/0000-0002-1470-4311; Dennis, Richard/0000-0002-4972-1509",,,,,33,2,2,2,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Individuals with higher cognitive reflection test (CRT) scores achieve greater earnings, and tend to sell in the overpriced futures market, while traders with lower CRT scores make purchases in the futures market.

This a priori surprising result for small firms is robust to a wide array of specifications and controls. Our theoretical explanation for these observations rests on the presence of fixed costs of exports per destination and short-run demand shocks. In this setup, the volatility of a firm's exports depends not only on the diversification of its destination portfolio but also, on whether it exports permanently to all markets. Among small exporters, a more diversified pool of destinations makes the firm more likely to export occasionally to some markets, thereby raising export volatility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We build an exporter dynamics model where firms need to pay market-specific sunk and fixed costs to operate abroad and where firm export profitability in each foreign market follows a geometric Brownian motion. Firms also differ ex ante by a constant market-specific profitability shifter. We derive the probability of export survival upon entry in a market and show that it increases with the ratio of sunk to fixed costs and is insensitive to the profitability shifters. Also, we show that the survival probability is unaffected by fixed costs if sunk costs are zero. We take the model to the data using firm-level Argentine export information. We find that survival rates decrease with distance, which the model rationalizes with sunk costs that increase with distance proportionally less than fixed costs. Estimated sunk costs are small. In fact, a counterfactual exercise shows that removing those costs increases aggregate exports by less than 1.5%. Finally, we also find that survival increases with a firm's export experience. Analogously to distance, the model's implication of this empirical result is that experience reduces sunk costs proportionally less than fixed costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abandoning the former's view that inequality will fall with progress in industrialization and placing more emphasis on inequality in foreign aid policy will lead to more sustainable development outcomes. Inter alia: mitigate short-term poverty, address concerns of burgeoning population growth, train recipient governments on inclusive development, fight corruption and mismanagement and avoid the shortfalls of celebrated Kuznets' conjectures. We discuss how the essay addresses post-2015 development challenges and provide foreign aid policy instruments with which discussed objectives can be achieved.

Our analysis suggests that this decline produced a cumulative stimulus of about 0.9 percent of real GDP by raising private real consumption and non-oil-related business investment, and an additional stimulus of 0.04 percent, reflecting a shrinking petroleum trade deficit. This stimulative effect, however, has been largely offset by a large reduction in real investment by the oil sector. Hence, the net stimulus since June 2014 has been close to zero. We show that the U.S. economy's response was not fundamentally different from that observed after the oil price decline of 1986. Then as now, the U.S. economy's response is consistent with standard economic models of the transmission of oil price shocks. We find no evidence that frictions in reallocating capital and labor across sectors or increased uncertainty about the price of gasoline explain the sluggish response of U.S. real GDP growth. Nor do we find evidence of financial contagion, of spillovers from oil-related investment to non-oil-related investment, of an increase in household savings, or of households deleveraging.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,,,,,8,86,92,0,8,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The analysis is performed on a novel dataset containing detailed information on a range of push' and pull' factors, allowing one to estimate the effects of a number of important school-level characteristics on these flows. This is achieved by estimating and comparing a fixed-effects Poisson model and two conditional fixed-effects negative binomial models and selecting the best model on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The preferred negative binomial model accounts for over-dispersion in the student flow data and allows for estimation of the parameter coefficients of the HEI-invariant characteristics. The analysis suggests that while geography plays a very important role in explaining student flows, so too do a range of school-level characteristics. Furthermore, it is found that distance has a differential impact across HEIs and HEI types with important implications for policy-makers and HEI managers.","[Cullinan, John] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Duggan, Jim] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Informat Technol, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Cullinan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",john.cullinan@nuigalway.ie; jim.duggan@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,35,21,24,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We study a two-sided matching model with transferable utility where agents are characterized by privately known, multi-dimensional attributes that jointly determine the surplus of each potential partnership. We ask the following question: for what divisions of surplus within matched pairs is it possible to implement the efficient (surplus-maximizing) matching? Our main result shows that the only robust rules compatible with efficient matching are those that divide realized surplus in a fixed proportion, independently of the attributes of the pair's members: each agent must expect to get the same fixed percentage of surplus in every conceivable match.

The tax-inclusive theory implies, even under full risk sharing, a predictable relationship between consumption growth and the consumption and capital income tax rates, both within and across countries. We find strong empirical evidence in favor of this relationship. While idiosyncratic output fluctuations account for substantially more of cross-country consumption growth variability than do taxes, trends in tax differentials are found to be informative about the dynamic evolution of international risk sharing. In particular, adjusting for capital taxes reveals a marked improvement in risk sharing over the last three decades that is absent in baseline measures. This improvement has been driven by the convergence of average tax rates on capital income across OECD countries toward the United States average capital tax rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Due to lack of data, this key issue had not been studied before. Thus, my first contribution is to build a new comprehensive database of sovereign debt stocks and yields, at all different maturities, for six EA countries in 1991-2013: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In general, since 1991, interests rates in the EA have fallen while Treasuries in the region extended debt maturity; thus, an increasing number of long-term bondholders experienced large capital gains. I show with counterfactual simulations the effect of a different maturity structure on the evolution of debt. My analysis suggests that extending debt maturity in 2013-2015 would result in lower debt ratios by 2022. I also estimate the impact on EA debt-to-GDP ratios induced by changes in current and future inflation. My estimates indicate that higher (lower) inflation in EA countries would lower (raise) their fiscal burden much more than in the US. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We find that, first, whether robust optimal monetary policy under commitment responds more cautiously or more aggressively depends crucially on the source of shock. Imperfect pass-through amplifies the robust policy. Second, if the central bank is concerned about uncertainty, it dampens volatility in the inflation rate preemptively but accepts higher volatility in the output gap and loan rate. However, for highly sticky loan rates, insurance against model misspecification becomes particularly pricy. Third, if the central bank fears uncertainty only in the IS equation or the loan rate equation, the robust policy shifts its concern for stabilization away from inflation.","[Gerke, Rafael; Hammermann, Felix] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Hammermann, F (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",felix.hammermann@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,34,6,7,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Tatonnement theory predicts that prices are globally unstable for this economy, i.e. unless prices start at the competitive equilibrium they oscillate without converging. Anderson et al. (2004) report that in laboratory double auction markets, prices in the Scarf economy do indeed oscillate with no clear sign of convergence. We replicate their experiments and confirm that tatonnement theory predicts the direction of price changes remarkably well. Prices are globally unstable with adverse effects for the economy's efficiency and the equitable distribution of the gains from trade. We also introduce a novel market mechanism where participants submit demand schedules and prices are computed using Smale's global Newtonian dynamic (Smale, 1976b). If the submitted schedules are competitive sets of quantities that maximize utility taking prices as given the resulting outcome is the unique competitive equilibrium of Scarf's economy. In experiments using the schedule market, prices converge quickly to the competitive equilibrium. Besides stabilizing prices, the schedule market is more efficient and results in highly egalitarian outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We analytically show that different factor intensities in the production of tradable and nontradable sectors affect the government's response to changes in trade openness. Specifically, if the production of the nontradable sector is more capital-intensive, a positive relationship between trade openness and government size will be observed. In contrast, if the production of the tradable sector is more capital-intensive, a negative correlation between trade openness and government size will arise. This theoretical prediction is robust to both utility-enhancing and productive government expenditures. The differentiated factor intensities therefore provide a potential explanation to the mixed empirical findings in the literature about the long-run relation of trade openness and government size.","[Jiang, Mingming] Shandong Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Jiang, MM (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",mingming.jiang@sdu.edu.cn,"Jiang, Mingming/W-4776-2019","Jiang, Mingming/0000-0003-0779-9516","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333009, 71403061]; Scientific Research Foundation for ROCs; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for ROCs(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University,"I would like to thank William A.

In addition, liquidity impairment appears to become more severe with insufficient experts' predictability and accuracy rather than with policy rate change itself and unscheduled announcements. Finally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements, changes in the Volatility Index (VIX), and trading by foreign investors play a limited role in explaining stock market liquidity changes.

The distinction of the two concepts clarifies the relation between the market efficiency in the sense of Fama (1970) and the over- (under-) valuation for evaluating the stock market. Then, this study proposes an alternative measure of 'magnitude of market inefficiency' for accessing the trading systems and applies this measure to the nine stock markets during the two sub-periods. The trading systems of three markets improve in the second period, while the others become worse. This study also proposes an alternative measure of a fundamental value of stock price based on a macroeconomic model and makes clear the relation of the over- (under-) valuation of the market to the magnitudes of market inefficiency. Thus, the application to the Japanese stock market indicates that the magnitudes of inefficiency are small compared with the net over- (under-) valuations. It is because the magnitude of inefficiency is stationary while the net over- (under-) valuation is non-stationary. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper constructs a twin banking and currency crisis model by introducing the banking sector into the currency crisis model and examining the case in which the exchange rate risk is located in the banking system. The model shows that an unanticipated shock caused by the shift of investors' expectations and/or a negative productivity shock can trigger a twin banking and currency crisis. To achieve both financial stability and economic stability, the central bank uses multiple monetary policy instruments. In contrast to the conventional policy recommendation in response to a currency crisis, i.e., interest rate hike, we find that when the exchange rate risk is located in the banking sector, the monetary policy option to prevent a twin crisis is to lower the policy interest rate and the reserve requirement ratio and raise the interest rate on reserves. Our results show that the location of the exchange rate risk matters for the choice of an appropriate monetary policy response during a crisis.","[Nakatani, Ryota] Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Hongokucho, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Nakatani, R (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Hongokucho, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",nakatani.ryouta@gmail.com,"Nakatani, Ryota/P-6230-2019","Nakatani, Ryota/0000-0001-5661-2215",,,,,53,13,13,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In particular, we are interested in exploring the impact of inflation targeting (IT) on real effective exchange rate (REER) volatility for a panel of 62 developing countries over the period 2006-2012. We also analyze the impact of IT regimes on REER in terms of its two component parts, i.e. relative tradable prices across countries as well as sectoral prices of tradables and nontradables within countries. The paper accounts for self-selection concerns regarding policy adoption and examines the effects of commodity exports and foreign exchange intervention. Notably, IT regimes seem to have experienced greater REER volatility, largely driven by external prices in developed countries. For developing countries, IT regimes show no difference in REER volatility, though there is some evidence that they have lower volatility in internal prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thanks to greater economic freedom, economic growth increased sharply and hundreds of millions of people have been removed from poverty. By all accounts, however, economic freedom in China has a long way to go. The U.S. perspective should be that these market reforms continue. These further reforms toward economic freedom and economic growth in China will be beneficial to the United States. Such reforms would include a greater transparency about the monetary policy strategies, more openness of the capital accounts and less exchange rate and stock market intervention. Such economic reforms should be welcomed and encouraged by the United States and other countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This review essay draws on three books which share this view of institutions, to develop an argument on which institutions matter most, and how and why they change. Like them, it uses history as laboratory. North et al. (2009) in Violence and Social Orders focus on Britain, France and the United States, in which change was generally progressive, to study such change from the medieval to the modern period. Jan van Zanden in The Long Road to the Industrial Revolution looks at Europe, 1000-1800, in particular the Netherlands and England, finding regressive as well as progressive change. Acemoglu and Robinson also examine both directions of change, in Why Nations Fail: they range widely in space, but little before the 16th century. All three offer powerful tools of analysis. All have implications for policy-makers in advanced societies who wish to promote the development of inclusive' institutions elsewhere. Two striking surprises emerge, and one prime mover - an institution with particular power to change others - the medieval Catholic church.","[Tylecote, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Tylecote, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",a.tylecote@shef.ac.uk,,"Tylecote, Andrew/0000-0002-9521-7127",,,,,22,11,13,1,34,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

I present three theories to explain the dynamics of share prices: rational expectations, behavioral finance, and an institution-oriented theory. Institutional investors are the dominant actors on financial markets. They hold the majority of the share capital in big companies. They tend to drive financial markets to a higher level of risk (volatility). The greater the percentage of the share capital held by institutional investors in a company, the higher the volatility (variance) of the share price. The results of my multilevel analysis confirm this hypothesis (a sample of 1,369 firms in twenty-two OECD countries). There are also significant differences among the OECD countries. Whereas both financial market crises originated in the United States, the country did not have the highest level of volatility in the period from 2000 to 2013.","[Windolf, Paul] Univ Trier, Dept Sociol, Sociol, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Windolf, P (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Sociol, Sociol, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",,,,Hans Boeckler Foundation (Germany),Hans Boeckler Foundation (Germany),Paul Windolf is a professor of sociology (emeritus) in the Department of Sociology at the University of Trier (Germany).

In this paper, we use synthetic panels to show that, despite progress, the region remains characterized by substantial vulnerability that also affects the rising middle class. More specifically, we find that 65 % of those with daily income between $4 and 10, and 14 % of those in the middle class experience poverty at least once over a 10-year period. Furthermore, chronic poverty remains widespread (representing 91 and 50 % of extreme and moderate poverty, respectively). Differences between rural and urban areas are substantial. Urban areas, which are now home to most moderate poor and vulnerable, are characterized by higher income mobility, particularly upward mobility. These findings have important implications for the design of effective social safety nets.

While this assumption is reasonable for many dimensions of well-being like income, education, or empowerment, there are some cases where it is definitively not relevant, in particular with respect to health. For instance, health status is often proxied using the Body Mass Index (BMI). Low BMI values can capture undernutrition or the incidence of severe illness, yet a high BMI is neither desirable as it indicates obesity. Usual illfare indices derived from poverty measurement are then not appropriate. This paper proposes illfare indices that are consistent with some situations of non-monotonic well-being relationships and examines the partial orderings of different distributions derived from various classes of illfare indices. An illustration is provided for child health as proxied by a weight-for-age indicator using DHS data for Bangladesh, Colombia and Egypt during the last few decades.","[Apablaza, Mauricio] Univ Desarrollo, Concepcion, Chile; [Bresson, Florent] Univ Auvergne Clermont Ferrand 1, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Yalonetzky, Gaston] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Universidad del Desarrollo; University of Leeds,"Apablaza, M (通讯作者)，OPHI, Oxford, England.;Apablaza, M (通讯作者)，Univ Desarrollo, Fac Govt, Concepcion, Chile.",mauricio.apablaza@qeh.ox.ac.uk,"Yalonetzky, Gaston/AAH-9829-2020; Apablaza, Mauricio/G-7589-2016","Yalonetzky, Gaston/0000-0003-2438-0223; Apablaza, Mauricio/0000-0003-1306-3791",,,,,33,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

These effects are driven by less-skilled export-manufacturing jobs which raised the opportunity cost of schooling for students at the margin.","[Atkin, David] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Atkin, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Atkin, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Atkin, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",atkin@mit.edu,,,Princeton University,Princeton University(Princeton University),"Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, and NBER (e-mail: atkin@mit.edu).

In Germany, a liberal Reform movement developed in response to emancipation, while Ultra-Orthodox Judaism emerged in eastern Europe. We develop a historical narrative and model of religious organization that accounts for the polarized responses by Jewish communities. Our explanation is based on a tradeoff between time and money contributions. A religious organization chooses between a relatively affluent community that expends little effort on religious participation and a poorer community that devotes a large amount of time and effort to religious activity. Political and economic development shape this tradeoff in unexpected ways, leading to complex forms of behavior such as religious schisms and cycles. When preferences are transmitted intergenerationally, organizations tend to be more conservative. Our historical narrative points to further extensions of extant models of religion, as well as providing broader insights into cultural integration and religious change.

Drawing back on work in industrial organization, we analyse the relationship between profit persistence and factor-adjusted stock returns looking at about 2000 listed US firms over the last 34 years. While the relationship between (current, lagged and unexpected) profits/earnings and returns has been extensively analysed before, to our knowledge this is the first study to look at the relationship between stock returns and profit persistence. We interpret profit persistence as a result of market competition and innovation of the firm. It is shown that firm-specific long-run profit persistence after correction for other additional economic fundamentals of the firm has a positive impact on four-factor adjusted returns and a negative impact on their volatility.","[Gschwandtner, Adelina] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Hauser, Michael] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Vienna, Austria",University of Kent; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Gschwandtner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",a.gschwandtner@kent.ac.uk,,,Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [V58 G14]; Austrian foundation,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian foundation(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),The research was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): V58 G14 and was awarded the 'Theodor Koerner' Prize of the Austrian foundation with the same name.,,31,0,0,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using Nielsen barcode data on prices and sales, we find that variation in firm appeal and product scope explains at least four fifths of the variation in firm sales. We show that the imperfect substitutability of products within firms, and the fact that larger firms supply more products than smaller firms, implies that standard productivity measures are highly dependent on implicit demand system assumptions and probably dramatically understate the relative productivity of the largest firms. Although most firms are well approximated by the monopolistic competition benchmark of constant markups, we find that the largest firms that account for most of aggregate sales depart substantially from this benchmark, and exhibit both variable markups and substantial cannibalization effects.","[Hottman, Colin J.] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; CEPR, London, England; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Columbia University,"Hottman, CJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,,"Hottman, Colin/0000-0001-9886-5448","Princeton University; Columbia University; NSF [1127493]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1127493] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Princeton University(Princeton University); Columbia University; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We are grateful to the editor, four referees, Andrew Bernard, Swati Dhingra, Cecilia Fieler, Gene Grossman, Oleg Itskhoki, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg, Bernard Salanie, and conference and seminar participants at Columbia, ERWIT, Dartmouth, Harvard, LSE, NBER-ITI, Philadelphia-Fed, Princeton, UBC, UC Berkeley, UC Merced, UCLA, and UCSD for helpful comments.

Here it is demonstrated that this procedure is based on an incorrect and systematically too optimistic asymptotic approximation to the variance of inconsistent least-squares. Therefore, and because the suggested sensitivity findings pertain to a random set of estimated endogeneity correlations, the claimed significance levels are misleading. For a very basic one coefficient model it is demonstrated why much more sophisticated asymptotic expansions under a stricter set of assumptions are required. This enables to replace some of the flawed earlier sensitivity analysis results for an empirical growth model by asymptotically valid findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the role of labor market imperfection in open economies for the usage of talent in the production process of firms. For this purpose, I set up a heterogeneous firms model, where production consists of a continuum of tasks that differ in complexity. Firms hire low-skilled and high-skilled workers to perform these tasks. How firms assign workers to tasks depends on factor prices for the two skill types and the productivity advantage of high-skilled workers in the performance of complex tasks. I study the firms' assignment problem under two labor market regimes, which capture the polar cases of fully flexible wages and a binding minimum wage for low-skilled workers. Since the minimum wage lowers the skill premium, it increases the range of tasks performed by high-skilled workers, which enhances the stock of knowledge within firms to solve complex tasks and reduces the mass of active firms. In a setting with fully flexible wages trade does not affect the firm-internal assignment of workers to tasks. On the contrary, if low-skilled wages are fixed by a minimum wage, trade renders high-skilled workers a scarce resource and reduces the range of tasks performed by this skill type with negative consequences for the human capital stock within firms. In this case, trade leads to higher per-capita income for both skill types and thus to higher welfare in the open than in the closed economy, whereas - somewhat counter-intuitive - inequality between the two skill types decreases, as more low-skilled workers find employment in the production process.","[Koch, Michael] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Koch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",michael.koch@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Koch, Michael Johannes/0000-0001-9412-495X",Bavarian Graduate Programin Economics (BGPE),Bavarian Graduate Programin Economics (BGPE),"I would like to thank the editor Steven Matusz and one anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

The paper uses a unique quarterly panel dataset containing financial information on over 100 000 individuals. The dataset covers the period 2005-2011, when there were large changes in credit volumes, income and consumption in Estonia, a new EU member country. The estimations show that indebtedness measured by the debt-to-income ratio and the debt service ratio hampers consumption over the whole business cycle. The negative impact of the debt service ratio is, however, substantially stronger during the recession than in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, while the negative effect of the debt-to-income ratio is relatively stable over the sample period. The findings suggest that household indebtedness is amplifying the recession and the debt repayment burden indicates the mechanism which is at work.

Every period, after an alternative is chosen, the utility of that, and only that alternative, may change while the utility of all other alternatives remains fixed. The model provides a platform on which many behavioral dynamic phenomena may be examined. We utilize it and look into the behavioral implications of bounded memory, status quo bias and variety seeking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Past work has shown that U.S. natives appear to value mixed sex composition whereas families in many Asian countries exhibit a strong son preference. We find that Asian immigrants who arrive to the US late in life show evidence of son preference since they are much more likely to have additional children if their first two children are girls. Asian immigrants who arrive early in life, however, exhibit a fertility pattern quite close to that of U.S. natives.

Moreover, individuals use a cognitive style, which is either intuitive-believing or reflective-analytical. I assume that the full benefit from religious activities is achieved by intuitive believers. The model predicts that, ceteris paribus, wealthier individuals and individuals with higher cognitive ability are more likely to abandon the intuitive-believing cognitive style. They may continue to attend church but do so less frequently than intuitive believers. In general equilibrium, there exists a locally stable steady state where believing and frequent church attendance is widespread across the social strata. A sufficiently large negative shock (e.g. the Enlightenment, repeal of Sunday shopping laws), however, initiates the gradual secularization of society. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Towards this end, we employ the Panel Analysis of Nonstationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common components (PANIC) procedures of Bai and Ng (2004, 2010), which allow for the decomposition of the observed unemployment rate series into a common component and an idiosyncratic component. This enables us to identify the exact source behind the nonstationary behavior in Spanish regional unemployment. Our analysis provides clear-cut evidence for the hysteresis hypothesis, which appears to be caused by a common stochastic trend driving all the regional unemployment series. These results are largely backed up by those obtained from the median-unbiased estimation of the persistence parameter which equals one for the common factor and to a lesser extent from the half-life estimate obtained from impulse-response functions that equals 12.5 years for the case of shocks hitting the common trend. This persistence analysis also provides evidence of stationarity for most of the idiosyncratic series (two regions being the exception), as found in the PANIC analysis.","[Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro C.; Romero-Avila, Diego; Usabiaga, Carlos] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"García-Cintado, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain.",agcintado@upo.es; dromtor@upo.es; cusaiba@upo.es,"Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/ABT-6325-2022; Usabiaga, Carlos/AAI-8911-2020; Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017","Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/0000-0003-1060-0256; Usabiaga, Carlos/0000-0002-1519-9070",,,,,76,0,0,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We employ school grades given to central bankers by the financial press, defining as superstars those central bankers receiving the top grade. First, we explain the grades in a probit estimation with measures of economic performance, institutional features, and personal characteristics. Second, we employ a matching approach to account for the endogeneity of grading with respect to economic performance. Using entropy balancing, we identify credible counterfactuals for top-graded central bankers, that is, nonsuperstar central bankers who face similar situations. Comparing the economic performance of both groups, we find that superstars do indeed matter: a top-graded central banker faces a significantly more favorable output-inflation tradeoff than his peers. This effect is driven by outstanding central bankers in both advanced and emerging economies and is especially prevalent in the precrisis subsample.","[Neuenkirch, Matthias] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, Trier, Germany; [Tillmann, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ & Business Studies, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Universitat Trier; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ & Business Studies, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",neuenkirch@uni-trier.de; Peter.Tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,"Neuenkirch, Matthias/0000-0002-7451-3613",,,,,47,28,29,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We propose a random intercept model to address this gap. For large datasets, this approach not only provides identical estimates like a fixed-effects approach, but also allows for the estimation of exporter- and importer-invariant variables.","[Prehn, S.; Glauben, T.] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Dept Agr Markets Mkt & World Agr Trade, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Prehn, S.; Bruemmer, B.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of Gottingen,"Prehn, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ, Dept Agr Markets Mkt & World Agr Trade, Halle, Saale, Germany.;Prehn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",prehn@iamo.de,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387",,,,,12,15,16,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper investigates how the electorate share of immigrant groups influences their likelihood of becoming politically mobilized, focusing on the mechanism of coalition formation with the Democratic Party. Using newly assembled data on ethnic enclaves in American cities at the start of the twentieth century, I show immigrants were more likely to mobilize politically as their share of the local electorate grew larger. This effect is driven by political mobilization in voting districts where the Democratic Party likely needed an immigrant group's vote to win elections. I also consider the shape of the electorate share effect, showing it is nonlinear and consistent with a political economy model of coalition formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This decline is expected to shift real income from oil exporter countries to oil importer countries. In this context, we study the effect of change in oil prices on Turkey's exports taking into account the fact that Turkey's export to oil exporting countries has approximately one-third share in total exports, while export to oil importing countries has a share of two-thirds. At the first step, we analyse the effect of oil prices on economic growth of trade partners of Turkey, where countries are grouped according to their net oil export position. We find that the effect of oil prices on different country groups' growth is asymmetric. In the second stage, for two groups of countries, we estimate growth-export elasticity through Turkey's export demand function. Finally, we calculate the net effect of oil prices on exports considering different income effects caused by oil price change on each country groups. Results indicate that the net effect of oil prices on the exports is limited given the current export shares.","[Culha, Olcay Y.; Ozmen, M.

But Gregory Mitchell has criticized behavioral law and economics (BL&E). He argues that much of the scholarship within the field describes psychological research as if it provides general laws of thought and behavior rather than insights conditional on the setting, on the characteristics of subjects, and on the specificity of the task in hand. Human heterogeneity is not adequately included in models developed under behavioral assumptions of this kind. This paper argues that Mitchell's work contributes to develop a cognitive approach to Law closer to the cognitive theory of institutions and to the Original Institutional Economics (OIE). Mitchell's contextualist approach seeks to identify the specific conditions under which irrational behavior occurs and to understand when and how it can be remedied.","[Ambrosino, Angela] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti deMartiis, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Ambrosino, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti deMartiis, Turin, Italy.",angela.ambrosino@unito.it,,,,,,,114,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The latter aspect is parsimoniously modeled through the presence of an expected future interest rate term in the Taylor rule that recent literature has found to be economically and statistically important in a variety of settings without anticipated shocks. Using Bayesian econometric methods, we find that the presence of anticipated shocks improves the model's fit to the US data but substantially decreases the weight on future macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking Taylor rule. Our results suggest that, although communicating its intentions regarding future monetary policy conduct, as modeled by anticipated monetary shocks, plays an important role for the Fed, responding to its expectations of future macroeconomic conditions does not. Furthermore, we conduct extensive robustness checks with respect to modeling the forward-looking specification of the Taylor rule that confirm our baseline results.","[Kapinos, Pavel] Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Div Insurance & Res, 550 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20429 USA; [Best, Gabriela] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Kapinos, P (通讯作者)，Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Div Insurance & Res, 550 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20429 USA.",pkapinos@fdic.gov,"Kapinos, Pavel/AAE-9132-2020","Kapinos, Pavel/0000-0001-5916-4884",,,,,47,7,7,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

On average, each year enrolled at one of these schools increases math scores by 0.08 standard deviations and English/language arts scores by 0.04 standard deviations relative to attending a counterfactual public school. There is wide variation in impact estimates. To glean what drives this variation, we link these effects to school practices, inputs, and characteristics of fallback schools. In line with the earlier literature, we find that schools that adopt an intensive No Excuses attitude towards students are correlated with large positive effects on academic performance, with traditional inputs like class size playing no role in explaining charter school effects. However, we highlight that No Excuses schools are also located among the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the country. After accounting for performance levels at fallback schools, the relationship between the remaining variation in school performance and the entire No Excuses package of practices weakens. No Excuses schools are effective at raising performance in neighborhoods with very poor performing schools, but the available data have less to say on whether the No Excuses approach could help in nonurban settings or whether other practices would similarly raise achievement in areas with low-performing schools. We find that intensive tutoring is the only No Excuses characteristic that remains significant (even for nonurban schools) once the performance levels of fallback schools are taken into account.","[Chabrier, Julia] MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab J PAL, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cohodes, Sarah] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Educ & Publ Policy, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Chabrier, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab J PAL, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jchabrier@povertyactionlab.org; cohodes@tc.columbia.edu; philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca,,"Cohodes, Sarah/0000-0002-7921-7020",,,,,58,39,76,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Building on sticky information models, the degree of inattentiveness is endogenized by allowing agents to choose between a costly full-information predictor and a costless sticky-information predictor. This is modeled as a choice between discrete alternatives under rational inattention. Recursive simulation shows that the dynamic equilibrium paths of aggregate variables are highly persistent and match the moments of U.S. data better than a model with fixed sticky information or with sticky prices, especially with regard to higher moments and the degree of persistence. Predictors are chosen in line with the predictions from rational inattention models, as the aggregate degree of attentiveness increases with rising variance of the forecast variable. Moreover, the model can generate hump-shaped impulse responses of inflation to a monetary policy shock if the degree of inattentiveness is sufficiently high.","[Draeger, Lena] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Dräger, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",Lena.Draeger@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,German Research Foundation [FR 2677/2-2],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"An earlier working paper version was circulated under the title Why Don't People Pay Attention?

Applying Hein and Vogel's (2008) methodology we conclude that the Brazilian economy showed a profit-led demand regime. In a context of high inflation, high concentration of markets, and wage control, retained profits were the main source to finance new capital. In this sense, we found a large sensitivity of investment relative to the wage share, a result that is compatible with a consumption pattern based on high income, which supported the growth trend with low wages observed during the period.","[Feijo, Carmem Aparecida; Cerqueira, Luiz Fernando] Univ Fed Fluminense, BR-24220000 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Camara, Felipe Figueiredo] Brazilian Stat Off, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Feijó, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, BR-24220000 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",,"FEIJO, CARMEM/G-6950-2019","FEIJO, CARMEM/0000-0002-6376-4599",,,,,30,4,5,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This survey serves two purposes-it is backward-looking in that it traces the historical and sociological origins of this field, and it is forward-looking in that it examines the insights and research themes that are offered by economists to investigate religion globally in the modern world. Several factors have influenced the economics of religion: (1) new developments in theoretical models including spatial models of religious markets and evolutionary models of religious traits; (2) empirical work that addresses innovatively econometric identification in examining causal influences on religious behavior; (3) new research in the economic history of religion that considers religion as an independent, rather than a dependent, variable; and (4) more studies of religion outside the Western world. Based on these developments, this paper discusses four themes-first, secularization, pluralism, regulation, and economic growth; second, religious markets, club goods, differentiated products, and networks; third, identification including secular competition and charitable giving; and fourth, conflict and cooperation in developing societies. In reviewing this paradoxically ancient yet burgeoning field, this paper puts forward unanswered questions for scholars of the economics of religion to reflect upon in years to come.","[Iyer, Sriya] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Iyer, Sriya] Univ Cambridge, St Catherines Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Iyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.;Iyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, St Catherines Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,210,163,183,7,100,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Conditional correlations between energy and non-energy sectors are highly persistent. The volatility spillover from the energy sector is prominent compared with mean and extreme market risk spillovers. Extreme risk spillovers from the energy to other sectors have an asymmetric effect.

Across numerous developing countries, recent learning assessments have revealed that children are not able to develop basic numeracy and literary skills. These low levels of learning are the result of a number of interrelated factors, many of which reflect the low levels of accountability across multiple levels of the education system. In this paper, I document the main education challenges facing developing countries, including the lack of accountability among teachers and school management. I also review recent literature that documents the effectiveness of interventions aimed at addressing these accountability issues.

Transactions in this property market, which can take on several forms of exchange of ownership or occupation, in many respects defy de Soto's definition of dead capital. Yet, despite this booming market, large parts of these residential areas are still regarded by local government as having no capital value. Although the titling of properties cannot be regarded as the only or even the main immediate solution to alleviating poverty within these communities, it certainly presents a real and immediate potential opportunity to many of them. This paper attempts to determine the potential size of this market. It starts with perspectives on land values, the property market and the titling of informal properties and examines different methods used in the evaluation of properties both in the formal and informal residential sectors. Drawing on empirical literature and research findings, the paper makes an attempt at establishing the form and value of what is regarded as the degree of undervaluation of real estate capital by the local authority.","[Geyer, Hermanus Stephanus] Univ Stellenbosch, CRUISE Geog, Chamber Mines Bldg,Merriman St, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Mohale, Mahlape] Stat South Africa, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa; [Geyer, Hermanus Stephanus, Jr.] Univ Stellenbosch, CRUISE Geog, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"Geyer, HS (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, CRUISE Geog, Chamber Mines Bldg,Merriman St, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",hsgeyer@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

According to him, their specificity contents define and separate the appropriate conditions for debt and equity governances. Our paper extends his contribution by arguing that, while the degree of specificity of the technology influences the choice of the governance, also the reverse is true: equity and debt governances involve different degrees of specificity. Thus, we have to deal with finance-technology complementarities, which can generate multiple organizational equilibria.

Under the sequential-bilateral-trade-agreements, (i) an importing country strategically takes a cost-efficient country as its first (second) trading partner when the MFN principle is (not) embedded, and (ii) embedding the MFN clause improves the trade surplus of the importing country and the world economy. The MFN principle is utilized by the cost-efficient country as a commitment device to encourage production. This principle reverses the welfare implication in the existing literature.

I find that, all else equal, flexible use licenses are significantly more valuable than licenses that proscribe certain uses, policy uncertainty depresses license value, and Verizon and AT&T pay more than other carriers for licenses. I also find that larger geographic definitions generally correlate with lower license values and, contrary to conventional wisdom, more bandwidth is not correlated with higher values. Finally, using auction data and information from large secondary trades, I find that spectrum prices have been increasing since the mid-2000s, though some evidence suggests that the rate of increase has been slowing.

Various scenarios, such as monopoly pricing or horizontal differentiation are considered. Insurers (or their regulator) can commit to a reimbursement policy which specifies two types of copayments: an ad valoremcoinsurance rate and a specific (per unit) copayment. By combining both copayment rates in an adequate way the insurer can effectively control the producer price, which is then set so that the producer's revenue just covers fixed costs. Consequently, a suitable regulation of the copayment instruments leads to the same reimbursement rule as under perfect competition for medical products. Additional rationing of coverage because of imperfect competition is notnecessary. The optimal policy involves the smallest possible copayment combined with the largest possible coinsurance rate such that the participation constraint of health providers is binding.

Using an extensive dataset on mobile phone activity in Rwanda and exploiting the quasi-random timing and location of natural disasters, we show that individuals make transfers and calls to people affected by disasters. The magnitude of these transfers is small in absolute terms, but statistically significant; in response to the Lake Kivu earthquake of 2008, we estimate that roughly US$84 in airtime was transferred to individuals in the affected region, that 70% of these transfers were immediately used to make outgoing calls, and that US$16,959 was spent calling those near the epicenter. Unlike other forms of interpersonal transfers, mobile airtime is sent over large geographic distances and in response to covariate shocks. Transfers are more likely to be sent to wealthy individuals, and are sent predominantly between pairs of individuals with a strong history of reciprocal favor exchange. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical strategy includes difference-in-differences and triple difference estimations. The results show that insurance provision increases the insured crop production by 16 percent and raises borrowing by 29 percent. Interestingly, it does not affect total household savings; however, it does affect the relative proportion of flexible-term savings. Furthermore, effects on production and savings persist in the long run, while effects on borrowing are significant in only the medium run.

Workers overperform in tasks they like and underperform in tasks they dislike to favorably influence future job assignments. Anticipating this, firms may find it optimal to commit to future multitasking to induce workers to appropriately allocate effort early in the employment relationship. We show that when the product market is volatile, so that future product prices are uncertain, the firm's ability to credibly commit to a multitasking strategy diminishes.

The LEAP model results indicate that if Argentina fully implements.the most feasible mitigation measures currently under consideration by official bodies and key academic institutions on energy supply and demand, such as the ProBiomass program, a cumulative incremental economic cost of 22.8 billion US$(2005) to 2050 is expected, resulting in a 16% reduction in GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual scenario. These measures also bring economic co-benefits, such as a reduction of energy imports improving, the balance of trade. A Low CO2 price scenario in LEAP results in the replacement of coal by nuclear and wind energy in electricity expansion. A High CO2 price leverages additional investments in hydropower. By way of cross-model comparison with the TIAM-ECN and GCAM global integrated assessment models, significant variation in projected emissions reductions in the carbon price scenarios was observed, which illustrates the inherent uncertainties associated with such long-term projections. These models predict approximately 37% and 94% reductions under the High CO2 price scenario, respectively. By comparison, the LEAP model, using an approach based on the assessment of a limited set of mitigation options, predicts an 11.3% reduction. The main reasons for this difference include varying assumptions about technology cost and availability, CO2 storage capacity, and the ability to import bioenergy. An emission cap scenario (2050 emissions 20% lower than 2010 emissions) is feasible by including such measures as CCS and Bio CCS, but at a significant cost. In terms of technology pathways, the models agree that fossil fuels, in particular natural gas, will remain an important part of the electricity mix in the core baseline scenario. According to the models there is agreement that the introduction of a carbon price will lead to a decline in absolute and relative shares of aggregate fossil fuel generation. However, predictions vary as to the extent to which coal, nuclear and renewable energy play a role. (C) 2016 Battelle Memorial Institute and The Authors.

The latter axiom requires that a preference reversal in the same direction by roughly one third of all voters is sufficient to break social indifference. This result substantially strengthens classical acyclicity theorems of Mas-Colell and Sonnenschein (1972) and Schwartz (1986). When the set of alternatives is large, cycles become intuitively easier to construct, the acyclicity axiom has greater bite, and the responsiveness threshold can be increased to two less than the number of individuals, which yields the weakest logically possible responsiveness axiom.

We consider mechanisms satisfying a set of basic properties (unavailable-type-invariance, individual-rationality, weak non-wastefulness, or truncation-invariance). In the house allocation problem, deferred-acceptance (DA)-mechanisms allocate objects based on exogenously fixed priorities, over agents. We show that DA-mechanisms are characterized by our basic properties and (i) strategy-proofness and population-monotonicity or (ii) strategy-proofness and resource-monotonicity. Once we allow for multiple identical copies of objects, on the one hand the first characterization breaks down and there are unstable mechanisms satisfying our basic properties and (i) strategy-proofness and population-monotonicity.

To explore the relationship between these variables, we develop a macroeconomic model with firms that are subject to both credit and labor market frictions. The value of collateral is driven by the forward-looking dynamics of the land price, which reacts endogenously to fundamental and non-fundamental (sunspot) shocks. We calibrate the model to French data and find that land price shocks give rise to significant amplification and hump-shaped responses of investment, vacancies and unemployment that are in line with the data. We show that both the endogenous movements in the firms' discount factor and the sluggish response of the land price are key elements that drive the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Or would it be better to speak about green capitalism? Going green is not only important in the fight against environmental destruction, it also makes a country stronger, healthier, safer, more innovative, competitive and respected, argues Thomas Friedman, the well-known New York Times columnist. Is there anything that is more patriotic, capitalist, and geostrategic than this? Indeed, the rationale underlying the nascent project of the green economy is that if the market could become the instrument for tackling the environmental crisis, the fight against this crisis could be the royal road to solving the problems of the market. Focusing in particular on the green economy's impact on climate change, this paper analyzes the green economy as a hegemonic project that tries to retranslate environmental concerns into a new jargon, and to turn environmental conflict into a new motor for economic development.","[Kenis, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Geog, Leuven, Belgium; [Lievens, Matthias] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Eth Social & Polit Philosophy, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Lievens, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Eth Social & Polit Philosophy, Leuven, Belgium.",Matthias.lievens@hiw.kuleuven.be,"Kenis, Anneleen/AAV-1460-2021","Kenis, Anneleen/0000-0002-6106-6340",,,,,86,25,26,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We measured firm agglomeration by per capita firm output at the district level and household welfare by per capita income, expenditure, and poverty. We find that firm agglomeration helps households move from the informal sector to the formal sector. As a result, there is a positive effect of firm agglomeration on per capita income, per capita expenditure, and poverty reduction, albeit of a small and time-decreasing magnitude. The effect of firm agglomeration on per capita expenditure tends to be higher for households with men, younger, and more educated heads than households with women, older, and less educated heads. Households in rural areas and those that do not have crop land are more likely to benefit from firm agglomeration than those living in urban areas and having crop land.","[Long Thanh Giang; Cuong Viet Nguyen] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tuyen Quang Tran] VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Polit Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam; Vietnam National University Hanoi,"Nguyen, CV (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",gtlong.neu@gmail.com; cuongwur@gmail.com; tuyentq@vnu.edu.vn,"Nguyễn, Cường/JDV-5253-2023; Giang, Long/AAF-1536-2020; Giang, Long/AAI-7052-2020; Nguyen, Cuong/L-8044-2018","Nguyen, Cuong/0000-0002-6803-3488; Tran, Tuyen/0000-0002-0221-1480",Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [II4.5-2012.10],Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)),This research was generously funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number II4.5-2012.10.

Effects of donor-recipient cultural differences on the aid-growth nexus,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aid effectiveness; Cultural differences; Genetic distance; Western education,TRANSMISSION,"Development aid from the West may lead to adverse growth effects in the global South due to the neglected cultural differences between development aid (paradigm) providers and recipients. I test this hypothesis empirically by augmenting an aid-growth model with proxy variables for cultural differences between donors and recipients. First, I use donor-recipient genetic distance, i.e., blood types, to capture the traditional way of cultural transmission. Second, I use western education of recipient country leaders to capture resource-based transmission of culture. Results of the OLS panel estimation in first differences show that a one unit increase in donor-recipient genetic distance reduces the main effect of aid on growth by 0.2 percentage points when aid is increased by one percentage point. In turn, a one percentage point increase in aid yields on average a 0.3 percentage point increase in growth after a decade for countries with western educated leaders.

Identifying asset managers as the dominant players in the investment chain, Mr Kay concluded that their appointment and monitoring was too often based on short-term relative performance and recommended an examination of the metrics employed. Using as conceptual framework the Keynes-Graham schema proposed by Woods in 2013, we demonstrate that the most commonly employed measure, the time-weighted rate of return, is inappropriate and inaccurate as a performance metric and should be replaced by the familiar, but generally ignored, money-weighted rate of return. Hitherto there have been three strands to the economics and finance literature on portfolio management, namely with reference to the efficient markets hypothesis, the selection of optimal portfolios in a mean-variance context using quadratic optimisation techniques and principal-agent issues that exist between portfolio managers and their clients. In this article, we initiate a new strand in the literature by focusing on the metric used to measure the performance of a portfolio manager, incidentally showing that our approach has immediate implications for the three existing strands.","[Woods, J.

When affirmative action was banned at UC law schools, Berkeley's black applications and enrollment declined by almost half even as black admission rates rose relative to whites. I ask whether black enrollment at UC law schools would have markedly declined even if black supply had not contracted. I find in a large sample of students applying to law schools nationwide that black supply contractions were driven mostly or entirely by students unlikely to gain admission under the ban, yielding stronger post-ban black applicant pools. Holding applicant pools constant, I estimate that the ban reduced black admission rates at both Berkeley and UCLA by half. Hence, black enrollment would likely have plummeted even if black supply had not contracted as could occur under a nationwide ban that eliminates affirmative-action-practicing alternatives.

The results show that the tourism-led growth hypothesis can be supported empirically.

Several contextual factors of an organization may result in employee silence. The current study tries to find out the relationship between perceived organizational politics, an important contextual factor, with employee silence behavior. This study focuses on the important motives behind employee silence in a context of organizational politics. Also, it investigates whether trust in supervisor could manipulate this relationship or not. The findings suggest a positive relationship between organizational politics and employee silence motives. Moreover, it suggests that employees do withhold information due to relational, diffident, defensive, disengaged, ineffectual and deviant motives in a political environment. Trust in supervisor did not hold for a moderation effect on this relationship.

While the economic benefits of knowing a second language are well established, the potential effects over the learning of other subjects have received much less attention. We evaluate a program that introduced bilingual education (in English and Spanish) in primary education in a group of public schools of the Madrid region in 2004. Under this program, students not only study English as a foreign language but also some other subjects (at least Science, History, and Geography) are taught in English. In order to evaluate the program, a standardized test for all sixth grade students in Madrid on the skills considered indispensable at that age is our measure of the outcome of primary education. Our results indicate that there is a clearly negative effect on the exam results for the subject taught in English, for children whose parents have less than upper secondary education. This negative effect is a composite of two phenomena: the effect of the program on the student's knowledge of the subject and a reflection of the student ability to do the test in their native language when English is the medium of instruction. Although we are not able to separate quantitatively these two effects, the composite effect has a relevant interest, because the results for exams taken in Spanish are the measures that determine academic progression in the Spanish system. In contrast with the previous result, there is no significant effect for anyone on mathematical and reading skills, which were taught in Spanish.

The main finding is that the rule leads to a gradual reduction in the level of public debt. Legislators reduce debt in periods when the demand for public goods is relatively low. They do so because the rule, by restricting future fiscal policies, raises the expected costs of carrying debt. Whether the rule increases citizen welfare depends on a comparison of the benefits of a lower debt burden with the costs of greater volatility in taxes and less responsive public good provision. A quantitative version of the model is developed in which costs and benefits can be evaluated. A welfare loss results if the debt level when the rule is imposed lies in the support of the long-run distribution associated with the unconstrained equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our focus is on New Keynesian models and areas that have seen significant developments since Ambler's (2009, Price-level targeting and stabilisation policy: a survey. Journal of Economic Surveys 23(5): 974-997) survey: optimal monetary policy; the zero lower bound; financial frictions and transition costs of adopting a PT regime. Ambler's conclusion that PT improves social welfare in New Keynesian models is fairly robust, but we note an interesting split in the literature: PT consistently outperforms IT in models where policymakers commit to simple Taylor-type rules, but results in favour of PT when policymakers minimise loss functions are overturned with small deviations from the baseline model. Since the beneficial effects of PT appear to hang on the joint assumption that agents are rational and the economy New Keynesian, we discuss survey and experimental evidence on rational expectations and the applied macro literature on the empirical performance of New Keynesian models. Overall, the evidence is not clear-cut, but we note that New Keynesian models can pass formal statistical tests against macro data and that models with rational expectations outperform those with behavioural expectations (i.e. heuristics) in direct statistical tests. We therefore argue that policymakers should continue to pay attention to PT.","[Hatcher, Michael] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Minford, Patrick] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Minford, Patrick] CEPR, London, England",University of Southampton; Cardiff University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Hatcher, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",M.C.Hatcher@soton.ac.uk,,"Minford, Anthony Patrick L./0000-0003-2499-935X; Hatcher, Michael/0000-0001-8506-1950","postdoctoral fellowship, Economic and Social Research Council, UK [PTA-026-27-2964]; ESRC [ES/I036834/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I036834/1] Funding Source: researchfish","postdoctoral fellowship, Economic and Social Research Council, UK; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We would like to thank Tony Yates and Alfred Duncan for useful comments.

For this purpose we construct a two-sector model - wage goods and luxury goods producing sectors - incorporating imperfections of the product and labor markets under income inequality. In a structure with interdependent and partially monopolistic and competitive markets, we analytically trace up the effects of the changes in power relations proxied by the degree of mark-ups in the product and labor market. The model shows that price and wage mark-ups in two sectors have crucial income distribution implications for the agents in the economy to varying extents. It also demonstrates the effect of the existence of the differentiated consumption patterns arising from income inequality on income distribution. Furthermore, it seems that unemployment level creates externalities on wage rate and on corporate taxes of firms.","[Yilmaz, Ensar] Yildiz Tekn Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Yilmaz, E (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tekn Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey.",enyilmaz@yildiz.edu.tr,,,,,,,25,0,0,2,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Toward this aim, a subcontractor selection model (CoSMo) was developed in this study. As a computational approach, the fuzzy sets method was employed because it can model human judgment by means of linguistic values, combining qualitative and quantitative decision criteria into an aggregate measure. Although the algorithm may be complex for easy acceptance by industrial practitioners, this disadvantage was minimized through a computer-supported system. In order to gain a better understanding of the current practice of CoSMo, a real world construction project was conducted. As a result, it was observed that CoSMo has high practical application and can be used as an advisory system by satisfying principal contractor's requirements to reduce the risk involved in the selection of a subcontractor. Moreover, it gives an initial idea of how subcontractors perform on each decision criterion and allows the main contractor to understand the picture on the strong and weak points of each bidder and thereby to take conscious decisions.","[Ulubeyli, Serdar] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey; [Kazaz, Aynur] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Bulent Ecevit University; Akdeniz University,"Ulubeyli, S (通讯作者)，Bulent Ecevit Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-67100 Zonguldak, Turkey.",serdar.ulubeyli@karaelmas.edu.tr,"KAZAZ, Aynur/B-9177-2016","Ulubeyli, Serdar/0000-0003-0871-7391",Committee on Research Grant of Bulent Ecevit University; Committee on Research Grant of Akdeniz University,Committee on Research Grant of Bulent Ecevit University(Bulent Ecevit University); Committee on Research Grant of Akdeniz University(Akdeniz University),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the managers of the surveyed company for their generous collaboration and contributions.

Furthermore, we investigate which individual and household characteristics determine transitions within the wage distribution. We find that overall, mobility reduces wage inequality. While a large part of wage inequality is due to unobservable characteristics, the equalizing effect of mobility mainly occurs within groups. Furthermore, both personal and household characteristics play an important role for wage transitions.

We show that when regulation is high in both countries, optimal policy requires significant departures from price stability both in the long run and over the business cycle. The adjustment to market reform requires expansionary policy to reduce transition costs, but deregulation reduces static and dynamic inefficiencies, making price stability more desirable once the transition is complete. International synchronization of reforms can eliminate policy tradeoffs generated by asymmetric deregulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By applying a difference-in-differences analysis to maize adoption in China from 1600 to 1910, we find that cultivation of this New World crop failed to raise per capita income. While maize accounted for a nearly 19 % increase in the Chinese population during 1776-1910, its effect on urbanization and real wages was not pronounced. Our results are robust to different sample selection procedures, to the control of variables pertinent to Malthusian positive checks, to different measures of economic growth and to data modifications. Our study thus provides rich empirical support to the claim that under the conditions in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century China, new agricultural technologies led to the Malthusian outcome of population growth without wage increases and urbanization.","[Chen, Shuo] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Kung, James Kai-sing] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Kung, JKS (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cs@fudan.edu.cn; sojk@ust.hk,,"Kung, James Kai Sing/0000-0001-9733-8638",GRF grant [642711]; Yan Ai Foundation,GRF grant; Yan Ai Foundation,"We are most grateful to four anonymous referees of this journal whose insightful suggestions have helped improve this paper tremendously.

This edition of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy explores whether this importance has been mirrored in the field of economics. It does so by bringing together the voices of 28 economists working on widely varying aspects of global health economics to confront three key policy questions: how do we build better, more equitable health systems? how are 'global commons' health problems to be overcome? and how might we improve evaluation and priority setting in global health? This assessment considers the degree to which these questions have been answered, and extracts the key thrusts of a research agenda. It suggests that, as in global health itself, while much has been achieved, many challenges and potential achievements await in the field of global health economics.","[Farlow, Andrew W.

In a two-country model, correlated asset fire sales by banks generate systemic risk across national financial markets. Absent coordination, national regulators choose inefficiently low levels of macro-prudential regulation. Thus, symmetric countries always benefit from relinquishing their authority to a central regulator that establishes uniform regulations across countries. I also consider the separate case of asymmetric countries: while there is a limit to coordination when countries are sufficiently asymmetric in a single dimension, existence of asymmetries in multiple dimensions might actually relax this limit or even eliminate it.

Using an incomplete information model, we argue that consuming conspicuous goods reveals information to criminals seeking bountiful victims and increases the likelihood of being victimized. Thus, property crime reduces the consumption of visible goods, even when these cannot be directly stolen but simply carry information about a potential victim's wealth. We exploit the large decline in property crime in the U.S. during the 90s to test this mechanism. Using data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1986 to 2003, we find that households located in states experiencing sharper reductions in property crime increased significantly their consumption of visible goods, even when these goods are not generally stolen, both in absolute terms and relative to other consumption goods. Our findings hold when we instrument the decline in property crime during the 90s using a variety of strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Bureau of the Census X-11 method, based on moving averages, correction of large errors and trading day adjustments, has long dominated. With the success of ARIMA modelling at the end of the 20th century, methods with better outlier detection and trading day corrections by regression with ARIMA errors have appeared, with the regARIMA module of Census X-12-ARIMA or Bank of Spain TRAMO-SEATS. SEATS consists of extracting the components by an ARIMA-model-based unobserved components approach. This means that models are used for each component such that the sum of the components is compatible with the ARIMA model for the corrected time series. The underlying theory of the SEATS program is studied in many papers but there is no complete and systematic description of its output. Our purpose is to examine SEATS text output and to explain the results in simple words and formulas. This is done on a simple example, a time series with a non-seasonal model so that the computations can be verified step by step. The principles behind SEATS are first described, including the admissible decompositions and the canonical decomposition, and the derivation of the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter. Then the example is introduced: the interest rates of US certificates of deposits. The text output from SEATS is presented in edited form in several tables. Finally, the main results are checked on the example by means of a Microsoft Excel workbook and direct computations. In particular, the forecasts and backcasts are obtained; the admissible and canonical decompositions with two components are discussed; the filters are first derived using autocorrelations of two auxiliary ARMA processes, then applied on the prolonged time series; and the characteristics of the estimates, the revisions and the growth rates are analyzed.","[Melard, Guy] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Ave Franklin Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Melard, Guy] ECARES CP114 4, ITSE, Ave Franklin Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Mélard, G (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Ave Franklin Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Mélard, G (通讯作者)，ECARES CP114 4, ITSE, Ave Franklin Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",gmelard@ulb.ac.be,"Mélard, Guy/IQR-7547-2023","Melard, Guy/0000-0001-9575-4793",,,,,35,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

The networks emerge as a result of dynamic cooperation between firms occupying different locations in the knowledge space. Partner selection is driven by absorptive capacity which is itself influenced by cognitive distance and R&D investment allocation. Under different knowledge regimes, we examine the structure of networks that emerge and how firms perform within such networks. We find networks that exhibit small world properties which are generally robust to changes in the knowledge regime. Certain network strategies such as occupying brokerage positions or maximising accessibility to potential partners pay off, especially in 'young' industries with limited involuntary but abundant voluntary spillovers.

In all four areas, the ruling western powers, Britain and France, attempted to introduce inclusive economic institutions with a strong emphasis on private property. These institutions advanced economic growth in all four regions, but there were differences in their growth rates. For example, Palestine had the best growth, even though the British were more successful in instituting inclusive institutions in Trans-Jordan. In Palestine, there was also a huge increase in the proximate causes of growth that did not happen in Trans-Jordan. The paper suggests a refined formulation of the relationship between inclusive institutions, proximate causes of growth, and economic growth. Inclusive institutions will generate economic growth, but at a slower pace. If a country is able to enhance its proximate causes of growth, then the joint effect of the proximate causes of growth and inclusive institutions will lead to much quicker growth.","[Schein, Andrew] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel",,"Schein, A (通讯作者)，Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel.",,,,,,,,86,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Wage distributions for men and women do not only differ by a fixed constant; differences are more complex. We show that focusing on the bottom of the wage distribution reveals a larger gender gap. Our distribution-sensitive analysis can also be used to study whether the statistical disadvantage of women in average pay might be 'offset' by lower inequality. Over a broad range of plausible preferences over inequality, we show however that 'inequality-adjusted' estimates of the gap can be up to three times higher than standard inequality-neutral measures in Eastern Germany and up to fifty percent higher in Western Germany. Using preference parameters elicited from a hypothetical risky investment question in our sample, inequality-adjusted gender gap measures turn out to be close to those upper bounds.","[Selezneva, Ekaterina] Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Landshuter Str 4, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany; [Van Kerm, Philippe] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung,"Van Kerm, P (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",eka.selez@gmail.com; philippe.vankerm@liser.lu,"Van Kerm, Philippe/N-8822-2019; Van Kerm, Philippe/B-5998-2015","Van Kerm, Philippe/0000-0002-0639-9097; Van Kerm, Philippe/0000-0002-0639-9097; Skoglund, Ekaterina/0000-0002-3784-0842",Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg,Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg,"This paper was prepared when Van Kerm visited the Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (IOS Regensburg) whose support and hospitality are gratefully acknowledged.

This paper reviews the regional accounts in India, discusses their role in Indian federal and state policies, and provides new estimates to cover major data gaps. Statistics on domestic product by Indian state, broken down by industry, are regularly published. But despite demands and recommendations by various commissions and policymakers, a comprehensive system of regional accounts is yet to be developed. New estimates for the period 1993-2010 are presented for saving and the macro-economic expenditure by Indian states, like final consumption, capital formation, and trade balance. They show, for example, that some of the fastest growing Indian states have increased their saving and investment rates to 50 percent of their domestic product.","[Sethia, Deepak] Indian Inst Management, Fac Block C, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore,"Sethia, D (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Fac Block C, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.",sethiad@iimidr.ac.in,,,,,,,46,0,0,1,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The former is always tragic, the latter not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the anticommons is more serious when it involves knowledge than when it involves physical resources. Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) formal model of the anticommons is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, and their neoliberal suggestion that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is misleading. This article argues that the only, epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The article also constructs a simple formal model based on Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model, as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The analysis supports the worldwide movement for free knowledge, and dissents from the evolving political and academic consensus in China in favor of more restrictive intellectual property regimes.","[Zhou, Yi] Fudan Univ, Dept Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zhou, Y (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Dept Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhou-yi@fudan.edu.cn,"zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023",,,,,,51,1,2,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The model, which measures additional bank capital required to compensate for fluctuating credit risk, is a novel combination of the Merton structural model, which measures distance to default and the timeless capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which measures additional returns to compensate for additional share price risk. We apply the model to a portfolio of mid-cap loan assets over a 10-year period that includes pre-GFC (global financial crisis), GFC and post-GFC. An analysis of actual defaults over this period shows the model to be far more accurate in determining the capital adequacy levels needed to counter credit risk than an unresponsive ratings model such as the Basel standardized approach.","[Allen, D.

After reviewing measures of the price-distorting effects of trade-related policies, it assesses estimates from global simulation models of the welfare effects of trade liberalizations prior to the WTO's Doha round, including the net benefits and transfers associated with implementing the Uruguay Round agreement on trade-related intellectual property rights, and then reviews estimates of the potential welfare effects of a Doha round agreement to cut tariffs and subsidies. Econometric estimates of past trade and related effects of the GATT/WTO are then examined, before turning to estimates of the benefits of WTO accession and of potential benefits from WTO-sponsored trade facilitation. The paper concludes that while it remains difficult to attribute reforms directly to the GATT/WTO, the overall body of evidence presented supports the economic profession's consensus that this institution has contributed substantially to global economic welfare.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,195,12,12,3,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Our framework covers models of income taxation, public-goods provision, or publicly provided private goods. Politicians are vote-share maximizers. They can propose any policy that is resource-feasible and incentive-compatible. They can also offer special favors to subsets of the electorate. We prove two main results. First, the unique symmetric equilibrium is such that policies are surplus-maximizing and hence first-best Pareto-efficient. Second, there is a surplus-maximizing policy that wins a majority against any welfare-maximizing policy. Thus, in our model, policies that trade off equity and efficiency considerations are politically infeasible.","[Bierbrauer, Felix J.] Univ Cologne, Macromol Res Ctr, Cologne, Germany; Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",University of Cologne; University of Mannheim; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Bierbrauer, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Macromol Res Ctr, Cologne, Germany.",,"Bierbrauer, Felix J/L-4129-2015","Boyer, Pierre C./0000-0002-5495-7380",Collaborative Research Center [884]; Thema at University Cergy-Pointoise; ENS-Cachan,Collaborative Research Center; Thema at University Cergy-Pointoise; ENS-Cachan,Boyer gratefully acknowledges the Collaborative Research Center 884 for financial support and Thema at University Cergy-Pointoise and ENS-Cachan for their hospitality and financial support.

We show that experiencing physical damage goes together with lower turnout, a higher probability of considering elections irrelevant and a lower probability of knowing one's local representatives. We also find that property damage is associated with greater support for pro-Western parties, lower support for keeping Donbas in Ukraine and lower support for compromise as a way to stop the conflict. Our paper thus shows the importance of investigating the impact of different kinds of victimization, as different degrees of victimization can have different, sometimes even conflicting outcomes. Our paper also suggests that one of the more optimistic conclusions of previous studies, that victimization can increase political participation, does not necessarily carry over to Ukraine, which illustrates the importance of country and context-specific studies.

In those years the US skill premium and residual wage inequality increased substantially. This paper presents a two-region, quality-ladder growth model where the lagging economy progressively catches up with the leader. As the innovation gap closes, the advanced country experiences fiercer foreign technological competition that forces its firms to innovate more. Faster technical change increases the skill premium and residual inequality. Offshoring production and innovation plays a key role in shaping the link between international competition and inequality.","[Impullitti, Giammario] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2QX, England",University of Nottingham,"Impullitti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2QX, England.",Giammario.Impullitti@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,4,5,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This paper attempts to bridge a gap between economic model and epidemiological model to analyze the optimal vaccination strategy when the diffusion of pandemic disease follows a stochastic process. Impulsive vaccination is considered as an effective option to control an infectious disease. A real option model under stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) environment is developed to examine the optimal vaccination threshold when the social costs and benefits of vaccination efforts are considered. A numerical illustration is provided for the case of H1N1 in Korea to show the herd immunity level as a policy rule to suppress epidemic. Policy implications are discussed regarding the vaccine stockpile as a countermeasure to epidemic diffusion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One full main panel and two subpanels were created by incorporating low-income and middle-income countries. The panel cointegration test results indicate a long-run relationship between the variables. The mean group (MG) estimators show that energy consumption, financial development, capital and international trade have significant impacts on economic output. In the case of middle-income countries, the Granger causality analysis reveals that rising economic output leads to higher energy consumption, but this is not true vice versa. This means that energy conservation measures are unlikely to have adverse impacts upon economic output. On the other hand, there is a complementary relationship between financial development and energy consumption. In this case, energy conservation measures should be critically analysed and implemented, so as not to have an unfavourable impact on financial development. In regard to low-income economies, there is no relationship between energy use and any of the other variables mentioned. Thus, a reduction in energy consumption has little or no significant impact on output, financial development, capital and trade.","[Thai-Ha Le] RMIT Univ, Ctr Commerce & Management, HCMC, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Le, TH (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Ctr Commerce & Management, HCMC, Vietnam Campus, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.",ha.lethai@rmit.edu.vn,,"Le, Thai-Ha/0000-0003-1158-7102",,,,,85,43,43,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper argues that the main motivations of local government to sell land are to promote industrial growth and to enhance government fiscal capacity. These two hypotheses are tested using prefecture-level data covering approximately 330 municipalities during the period of 1999-2007. The paper finds that industrial output and fiscal expenditure increase by approximately 1.8% and 1.0%, respectively, if the area of land sale doubles. Evidence also shows that land sale promotes industrial growth by boosting fixed asset investment and foreign direct investment. Interestingly, the paper also finds that the land-sale strategy of local governments is more effective in the eastern provinces than in other regions.","[Tian, Wei] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Liugang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongyan] Res Dept Int Monetary Fund, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Sheng, LG (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lsheng@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In equilibrium the voter uses the intermediary to insulate the policymaker from pandering incentives when the voter's policy expertise is low or the policymaker's congruence is high. The voter can thus enjoy the benefits of bureaucratic expertise without forfeiting electoral responsiveness. We examine the model's predictions using U.S. city-level data, and find that hierarchically-accountable managers reduce popular city employment, and adjust it more flexibly, than electorally-accountable mayors. The estimated, incentive effects are smaller in cities with high voter expertise and larger during election years, and are robust to instrumentation by precipitation shocks that influenced early 20th century manager government adoptions for reasons obsolete today.

This economy was a developing country until 2006 and we have observed a substantive FDI inflow since 1998. Multinationals have a higher sales share now and are an essential part of the economy. Multinationals engage less in innovation, but innovating MNEs spend more on R&D per employee and appropriate more from their innovated goods. The FDI inflow was a form of innovation wave.

It shows that the means to assess how they may be related is much more limited than recognised in the existing literature that is laden with contradictory hypotheses and findings. Better understanding our scientific limitations in studying this potential relationship is important for research and policy because many leading economists and other social scientists such as Acemoglu and Robinson mistakenly claim to identify causal linkages between inequality and democracy but at times still inform policy. In contrast to the existing literature, the paper argues that 'structural' or 'causal' mechanisms that may potentially link the distribution of economic wealth and different political regimes will remain unknown given reasons such as their highly complex and idiosyncratic characteristics, fundamental econometric constraints and analysis at the macro-level. Neither new data sources, different analysed time periods nor new data analysis techniques can resolve this question and provide robust, general conclusions about this potential relationship across countries. Researchers are thus restricted to exploring rough correlations over specific time periods and geographic contexts with imperfect data that are very limited for cross-country comparisons.","[Krauss, Alexander] UCL, Inst New Econ Thinking, London Sch Econ, Drayton House, London, England",University of London; University College London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Krauss, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst New Econ Thinking, London Sch Econ, Drayton House, London, England.",a.krauss@ucl.ac.uk,,"Krauss, Alexander/0000-0002-1783-2765",Institute for New Economic Thinking; Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in Germany,Institute for New Economic Thinking; Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in Germany,"I am grateful for funding from the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in Germany.

We provide new evidence to explain why some states and regions of the country spend much more on medical care than others, and why health care spending for the nation as a whole has been growing rapidly over the last several decades. To do this, we estimate a health care spending panel data model using annual data on all 50 states for the period 1993-2009. Our model includes a number of socio-economic, health care provider, lifestyle and environmental variables that past studies indicate may affect the level or growth of aggregate health care spending. We exploit the time effect component of our model to obtain an upper-bound estimate of the effect of advances in medical technology. Our findings indicate that the most important factors influencing the level of spending are availability of providers, income, excessive alcohol consumption, Medicaid coverage, HMO health plans and the proportion of the population elderly and African-American. The principal drivers of growth have been the continual introduction of new medical technologies, and the growth of providers and income.","[Thornton, James A.; Beilfuss, Svetlana N.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Eastern Michigan University,"Thornton, JA (通讯作者)，Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",jthornton@emich.edu,,", Svetlana/0000-0003-4334-4447",,,,,4,8,14,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The pricing mechanism we analyze reflects the way houses are bought and sold in the United States. Our model is consistent with the observation that houses are sometimes sold above, sometimes below, and sometimes at the asking price. We consider two versions of our model. In the first version, all sellers have the same reservation value. In the second version, there are two seller types, and type is private information. For both versions, we characterize the equilibrium of the game played by buyers and sellers. Our model offers a new way to look at the housing market from a search-theoretic perspective. In addition, we contribute to the directed search literature by considering a model in which the asking price (i) entails only limited commitment and (ii) has the potential to signal seller type.

In paper conceptual bases of formation of a regional construction cluster are stated. Increase of competitiveness of each of participants of a cluster, and also the region of their basing due to synergetic effect is result of its activity. For identification of cluster educations on the example of the Volgograd region it is used macro - and micro approach. Calculation is carried out with use of author's software products. Recommendations about creation of a regional construction cluster on the basis of the complex infrastructure project are developed. For the purpose of definition of potential clusters of the Volgograd region the methodology of the European cluster observatory is applied.

The EU economies must build their competitiveness in reality of knowledge-based economy. Thus, the QHC was analysed from the point of view of global knowledge economy. This factor was treated as a multidimensional phenomenon. As a result, it was measured with application of TOPSIS method, which allowed to obtained time series for dynamic panel analysis of determinants of TFP. In order to evaluate TFP parameters of the Cobb-Douglas production function for developed EU countries were estimated. Then, the relationship between the QHC and the level of TFP was assessed with application of dynamic panel model. The research was based on Eurostat data for the years 2000-2010.

The principal and the agent are risk neutral and the latter is subject to limited liability. Quantifying welfare loss as the ratio between the first-best social welfare and that arising from the principal's optimal pay-for-performance contract, we provide simple parametric bounds for problem instances with moral hazard. Relying on that, we compute the worst case welfare loss ratio among all problem instances with a fixed number of effort and outcome levels as a function of the number of possible effort levels and the likelihood ratio evaluated at the highest outcome. As extensions, we look at linear contracts and at cases with multiple identical tasks. Our work constitutes an initial attempt to quantify the losses arising from moral hazard when the agent is subject to limited liability, and shows that these losses are non-negligible in the worst case.

That decline was similar for all age and sex cohorts and thus did not reflect expected emancipation without compensation.

In the past two decades, the exponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) have been at the forefront in asserting the Keynesian (or Kaleckian) logic of this proposition, filling a theoretical vacuum in post Keynesian thinking. The question is that MMT consolidates the Treasury and Central Bank (CB) so that the latter automatically creates purchasing power in favor of decisions of the former to spend. Critics, however, point out that most institutional arrangements forbid CBs to finance the Treasury directly. After Lavoie (2013), the debate has moved forward and seen some convergence.

The estimated equilibrium relationship is in support of the relative law of one price. We find that both markets adjust in response to a disequilibrium in price disparity, leading to a sizeable error correction activity. The Shanghai market contributes to approximately two-thirds of the price discovery process. Competition and informativeness of trading affect the relative role of price discovery in each market.

This chapter argues that complexity theory has significant implications for workaday economic policy. Even if economists do not accept that the complexity scientific theory of the economy is ready for prime time, the complexity vision, which pictures an economy as a complex evolving system undergoing continual evolutionary change, has direct relevance for their workaday applied policy. The reason is that good applied policy is not applied science but rather more like engineering. This chapter explains why applied policy should not be viewed as applied science and explores some implications and examples of how using a complexity frame for economic policy changes workaday applied economic policy analysis. Specifically, it is argued that complexity policy opens up economics to a wide range of policies that go beyond the standard allocation policies that economists tend to focus on in the standard policy approach, and supplements them with a set of policies designed to influence the ecostructure within which individuals operate. This adds what might be called formation policy to allocation policy. Formation policy does not see the market and government as opposites, but rather views them as coevolving institutions. Formation policy is designed to influence that coevolution. An example of how complexity policy differs from standard policy can be seen in distribution policy. The standard approach to distribution policy tends to focus on redistributive taxes such as progressive income and wealth taxes. The complexity policy approach to distribution focuses more on modifying the length and nature of evolving property rights as embedded in patent and copyright law.","[Colander, David] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Colander, D (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,285,298,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200015,0

First, we provide a characterization of sd-efficient allocations in terms of a property of an order relation defined on the set of man-woman pairs. Then, using this characterization, we constructively prove that for each probabilistic assignment that is sd-efficient for some ordinal preferences, there is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility profile consistent with the ordinal preferences for which the assignment is Pareto efficient. Second, we show that when the preferences are strict, for each ordinal preference profile and each ex post stable probabilistic assignment, there is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility profile, consistent with the ordinal preferences, for which the assignment belongs to the core of the associated transferable utility game.

In 2011, the total number of patent applications for the first time exceeded two million -double the approximately 1.05 million patents filed in 1995. Understanding what is behind this growth is important, as it may indicate faster technological progress, new innovation models and strategic shifts in how companies use the patent system. Policy-makers need to understand what drives the growth in patenting worldwide, not least to evaluate how the patent system can cope with the increasing flow of applications. A number of studies have looked at the growth in patent filings in individual countries, but have not focused on the world as a whole. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing an analysis of global patenting trends using the most comprehensive data currently available. Among other things, it finds that subsequent patent filings -additional filings of the same invention, mostly in additional countries -contributed considerably to the growth in filings worldwide, pointing to globalization as one important driver of filing growth. However, no single factor can fully explain the marked increase in the use of the patent system.","[Fink, Carsten; Khan, Mosahid; Zhou, Hao] World Intellectual Property Org, Econ & Stat Div, 34 Chemin Colombettes, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland",,"Khan, M (通讯作者)，World Intellectual Property Org, Econ & Stat Div, 34 Chemin Colombettes, CH-1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland.",Mosahid.khan@wipo.int,,,,,,,17,18,19,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

This study investigates both the long-term and short-term price elasticities of water demand in the residential apartments in Auckland central city. Using 6 years of monthly time series data, the price elasticities were estimated through cointegration and error correction methods. The results showed that the price elasticities of water demand were -0.14 and -0.12 in the short term and the long term, respectively.

In contrast, with complements, the Vickrey outcome is efficient but not necessarily in the core and revenue can be low. Non-core outcomes may be perceived as unfair since there are bidders willing to pay more than the winners' payments. Moreover, non-core outcomes render the auction vulnerable to defections, as the seller can attract better offers afterward. To avoid instabilities of this type, Day and Raghavan (2007), Day and Milgrom (2008), and Day and Cramton (2012) have suggested adapting the Vickrey pricing rule so that outcomes are in the core with respect to bidders' reported values. If truthful bidding were an equilibrium of the resulting auction, then the outcome would also be in the core with respect to bidders' true values. We show, however, that when the equilibrium outcome of any auction is in the core, it is equivalent to the Vickrey outcome. In other words, if the Vickrey outcome is not in the core, no core-selecting auction exists. Our results further imply that the competitive equilibrium outcome, which always exists when goods are substitutes, can only be implemented when it coincides with the Vickrey outcome. Finally, for a simple environment, we show that compared to Vickrey prices, the adapted pricing rule yields lower expected efficiency and revenue as well as outcomes that are on average further from the core.","[Goeree, Jacob K.] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lien, Yuanchuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Technology Sydney; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Goeree, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.;Lien, YC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jacob.goeree@gmail.com; ylien@ylien.com,,,European Research Council (ERC) [ESEI-249433],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Larry Ausubel, Peter Cramton, Paul Milgrom, John Wooders, two referees, and especially the editor for their suggestions.

The model also matches the evidence that countries with higher tax rates have higher aggregate productivity, lower skill premia, and higher unemployment rates among both high- and low-skilled workers. The key mechanism that allows us to achieve these results is that aggregate and group specific productivities are endogenous and respond to changes in tax policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The significant role of ICT is stemmed from empowering humans, governments and organizations to renovate information into knowledge as a forceful driver in progressing lasting change in the globalization of economy and society. Given the significance of ICT development and innovation as a key cause in increasing productivity, growth rates, economic development and advancement in all expanses, the developed countries have given great importance to adopt ICT drivers, tools and techniques to achieve continuous technology development, so as followed by developing countries to be accommodated with international changes. Economists forecast that economic growth is motivated by investments in ICT. The determination of this investigation is to examine the effects of ICT capital and labour stocks on economic growth for Qatar covering the period from 1995 to 2013, as ICT is an important driver for the globalization process. The outcomes show that there is a positive and significant association between the GDP per capita and the ICT index.

Nevertheless, despite the several fundamental changes in its functioning and proved decrease in total emissions, it is still subjected to a certain criticism. This paper aims to describe briefly the EU Emissions Trading System and its evolution and to analyse how it is implemented in the Czech Republic in which the system represents rather controversial issue causing many questions. The Czech Republic gradually reduces its GHG emissions, but is, due to its strong industrial orientation, still among the ten biggest European polluters. It is necessary to take measures to reduce more emissions towards the successful fulfilment of its commitment within the EU energy and climate targets.","[Horuckova, Michaela] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Horúcková, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",horuckova@opf.slu.cz,,,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2016.",,18,0,0,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,241,249,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200025,0

It is essential for ensuring equivalent exchange of goods and services, comparing of particular state economies, etc. The resulting exchange rate defines the offer and demand as well as trust of investors for a certain currency. The biggest advances in historic development of exchange rates were achieved by Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming who expanded the basic IS-LM model. This paper focuses on Mundell-Fleming model in which the main role is played by the asset mobility that defines the changes in exchange rate as a result of monetary and fiscal policy changes. As there exist several versions of this model I chose the static model which is based on assumption that prices of goods are fixed. In the original model the effect of monetary policy by increasing money supply weakened the long-term exchange rate and shifted the LM curve to the right, whereas the fiscal policy by strengthening the long-term exchange rate and at the same time increasing the investments shifted the IS curve to the right. The aim of this paper is to modify this model by changing some of the parameters and subsequent observation and inspection of its equilibrium and stability. To find the equilibrium and stability we derive a non-homogenous system from this model which consists of two differential equations and solution of the given system is provided in a graphical way.","[Ilavska, Iveta] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Ilavska, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",iveta.ilayska@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Ilavska, Iveta/P-4536-2016","Ilavska, Iveta/0000-0002-2810-0703",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,726,733,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800090,0
