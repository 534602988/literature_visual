J,"Bollinger, B",,,,"Bollinger, Bryan",,,Green technology adoption: An empirical study of the Southern California garment cleaning industry,QME-QUANTITATIVE MARKETING AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dynamic programming; Discrete choice; Technology adoption; Information provision; Importance sampling; Regulated markets; Environmental policy; Green technology,AIR-QUALITY; DIFFUSION; MARKET; MODEL,"Green technology adoption may be limited by a variety of factors including a lack of sufficient private incentives, long equipment replacement cycles, or lack of information regarding the green alternatives. In California, multiple policy tools including financial incentives, command-and-control regulation, and information and training were used to overcome these obstacles in order to reduce the use of the polluting technology used in traditional dry cleaning. Exploiting the changing regulatory environment, I evaluate the effectiveness of the different policy tools by estimating a dynamic, durable goods replacement model with entry and exit. Because the strict regulations affect future years only, identifying the discount rate is crucial, which I estimate to be 0.94. Using counterfactual simulations under alternative policy regimes, I find that the provision of information and training offered through demonstrations increased adoption of that technology (wet cleaning) by over 200 %. Price incentives (via fees and grants) would have been ineffective at achieving widespread adoption of green technologies but were effective at accelerating adoption when combined with a future ban on polluting technologies. Using this combination of policy instruments led to a net welfare gain of $71 million (NPV) in 2002 when the policies were implemented.","[Bollinger, Bryan] Duke Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Bollinger, B (通讯作者)，Duke Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",bryan.bollinger@duke.edu,"Bollinger, Bryan/ABH-5961-2020","Bollinger, Bryan/0000-0001-8596-6418",Environmental Protection Agency,Environmental Protection Agency,"I would like to thank the Environmental Protection Agency for their support of this research.

Although AFs play an important role in a nation's capital market, the accounting industry has not attracted much attention to academic researchers. The main difference between the stochastic metafrontier function and the one proposed by Battese et al. (J Prod Anal 21:91-103, 2004) and O'Donnell et al. (Empir Econ 34:231-255, 2008) lies in the second step, where the stochastic frontier approach (SFA) is recommended instead of programming techniques. Taiwan's AFs are found to have the highest average metafrontier technical efficiency (MTE) and AFs in the US have the highest technology gap ratio (TGR). Nonetheless, the average TGR and MTE values of American AFs are closer to those of Taiwan. The low performance of Chinese AFs may be attributed to government regulations and the lack of market competition. However, the programming technique suggests reverse results for AFs in Taiwan and the US and larger variances for TGR and MTE. Then these three countries' AFs show decreasing returns to scale, indicating that mergers and acquisitions may not be advantageous for expanding their production scale.","[Chang, Bao-Guang] Tamkang Univ, Dept Accounting, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Huang, Tai-Hsin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Money & Banking, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Kuo, Chun-Yi] Tamkang Univ, Grad Inst Management Sci Accounting, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Chengchi University; Tamkang University,"Kuo, CY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Grad Inst Management Sci Accounting, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",baog@mail.tku.edu.tw; thuang@nccu.edu.tw; 136514@mail.tku.edu.tw,,"HUANG, TAI-HSIN/0000-0001-6518-4566","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [NSC 100-2410-H-032-036]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The first author is indebted to the financial support of Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC, with grant number: NSC 100-2410-H-032-036.

The consequence, it is argued, is under-development in the periphery and augmented productive capacity in the core. EUE thus challenges the neoliberal free-market argument that exchange at market prices is symmetric and fair. An LCA-based methodology for estimating EUE that holds constant the variable market price is introduced and tested on contemporary trade of Dutch cheese and Kenyan coffee and roses. Specifically, the exchange of embodied land, water, energy, global warming potential, and labor is assessed. The results confirm the theory's hypothesis. At a fixed market price, more embodied Kenyan resources are exchanged for less Dutch resources. However, Kenyan roses give different results from coffee. EUE between countries can only be conclusively determined by considering the total biophysical trade balance, but by calculating quantities of embodied resources per unit of exchange value, it is possible to detect unequal exchange even at the level of individual commodities. While integration of biophysical metrics alongside monetary valuation is recommended, ultimately, rethinking the structure, policies and politics of international trade is necessary.

Recently, scholars have argued that sixteenth-century Antwerp, and in its wake a series of other cities, hosted an open-access market as a result of an evolution towards open-access institutions. However, the direct effect of this institutional change on merchant enterprise is hard to measure. Relying on detailed tax records, preferences at the individual merchant level for particular destinations and commodities are documented, to evaluate whether exporters had equal chances in Antwerp's export market. A few exporters had large export shares next to a multitude of smaller merchants. The exports of these smaller merchants to distant destinations and their participation in the export of important products demonstrate a fairly level commercial playing field with regard to their larger-scale colleagues. Foreign traders had access to trade in Low Countries products, while local merchants were active in the export of major transit products. The activities of the latter group are particularly important; contrary to previous literature, Low Countries traders did not differ in their preference for home-grown products.","[Puttevils, Jeroen] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Puttevils, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium.",,,,Research Foundation Flanders; University of Antwerp,Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); University of Antwerp,"The author wants to thank those present at the Centre for Urban History seminar at the University of Antwerp, Prof. Oscar Gelderblom, Prof. Emeritus Hugo Soly, Prof. Peter Stabel, and the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

This paper introduces two novel components for refining the legitimacy of PES in water resource management. Firstly, we broaden consideration of human well-being in PES beyond income effects by considering justice as the freedom or capability to 'do and be' whatever is desired. Secondly, this paper applies social multi-criteria evaluation as a decision-support framework to determine the acceptability and payment vehicle of PES within a set of alternative policy considerations for a complex ecosystem management decision. Through both technical and social evaluations of different management options against a set of criteria, we highlight the legitimacy that different PES designs may have for improving water quality and capabilities for well-being.

The central aim is to reveal under what circumstances such adaptation takes place in a coordinated fashion, as opposed to adaptation by individual administrative units within their respective competences. Applying the concept of integrative vs. segregative institutions, the paper draws upon evidence from fourteen climate-sensitive municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The analysis, based on set-theoretic methods, finds that integrative institutions constitute a sufficient but not necessary condition for integrative adaptation. State administrations may thus avoid additional climate-related burdens for citizens and conflicts among resource users by providing local administrations with means for additional coordination.

We first synthesize and classify the psychological mechanisms behind motivation crowding effects. Then we conduct a systematic review of empirical studies that test for motivation crowding effects triggered by economic incentives to encourage nature conservation. Based on eighteen empirical studies, we identify evidence of motivation crowding out and, to a lesser extent, crowding in effects. Finally, we discuss the implications for environmental policy and research. We note that the limited comparability of results across studies, the lack of baseline information about pre-existing intrinsic motivations, and a complexity stemming from cultural and contextual heterogeneity appear to be the main challenges when it comes to establishing more conclusive evidence. We conclude that, as economic instruments for conservation are increasingly being used worldwide, it is crucial to assess existing intrinsic motivations and expected changes in people's motivational structures prior to large-scale implementation. We call for caution with economic incentives in situations involving considerable uncertainty regarding the detrimental impacts on intrinsic motivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While existing theoretical models on the voluntary provision of public goods usually focus exclusively on single motivations for individual contributions, we explicitly account for various motivations in a unified framework, drawing on theories for public good provision such as pure and impure altruism, internalized norms and social approval. Such an approach is particularly useful when individual offset behavior is heterogeneous. The applicability of our theoretical framework is supported by data from a choice experiment on voluntary carbon offsetting in Switzerland and the USA. We find that willingness to pay for offsets mainly depends on an individual's internalized norms to avoid environmental degradation as well as partly on income. The probability to offset, instead, is better explained by an individual's expected social recognition for offsetting. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This question is addressed in this article using unique district-level data for 148 districts of former British India. Controlling for observable differences in geography and income, the ordinary least squares estimates suggest a large and positive effect of colonial expenditures on rural primary education in 1911 on rural literacy up to 1991. However, instrumental variable estimates that control for the endogeneity of colonial investments suggest that the effects of historical spending are significant only up to 1971. Two policy changes can account for these findings: an increase in spending following the 1968 National Education Policy and a greater emphasis on the universal provision of public goods such as schools in the 1970s. Unlike recent studies documenting the persistent effects of historical investments on contemporary outcomes, this study emphasizes how effective policies can overturn the effects of history.","[Chaudhary, Latika] Scripps Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Scripps College,"Chaudhary, L (通讯作者)，Scripps Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,,,,,,42,22,24,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Despite the possibilities that companies were created for fraud and exploitation, countries using the corporate form more extensively before 1914 had higher GDP per capita. Through this process, the benefit of imperialism extended to British dominions, but not much, if at all, to British dependent colonies.","[Foreman-Peck, James] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Hannah, Leslie] London Sch Econ, London, England",Cardiff University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Foreman-Peck, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",,,"foreman-peck, james/0000-0001-9826-5725",,,,,43,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The index is calculated for firms from the Kauffman Foundation Firm Survey for years 2004 through 2009. The average value of the index increases over time as firms either improve their performance or exit the data set due to failure.

From 1950 to 2010, the number of households increased 72% faster than population size. In this paper we consider how this drift toward more and smaller households, occurring alongside rising affluence, undermines efforts to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by eroding household scale economies of consumption and associated CO2 emissions. To estimate the household scaling of CO2 emissions, we link consumer expenditure data to an economic input-output life-cycle assessment model. We find that the CO2 scaling benefits of cohabitation are compellingly large, with the carbon footprint of a representative person cohabiting with others being 23% less, on average, than if that same person lived alone. Additionally, we find that household scale economies: 1) decrease in income, reflecting the rise in the percentage of household expenditures devoted to more rival goods and services; and 2) increase intuitively in household size, reflecting the direct expenditure sharing benefits of cohabitation. The combined downward pressure on scale economies from declining household size and rising incomes, typifying the trajectory of developing societies toward more and smaller households and rising affluence, places significant upward pressure on CO2 emissions globally.

Previous investigations indicate that up to 50% or more patients can be treated in a fast track process compared to the standard procedure in some emergency departments. However most studies on emergency department (ED) fast tracks were based on evidence without using an efficient decision tool to show applicability of the results. An agent-based simulation tool is proposed in this research to evaluate fast track treatment (FTT) in an ED. The tool can study the behavior change of entities and resources in a complex ED system. Static and dynamic FTT processes are evaluated. The static process uses a fixed duration in the daily ED operation. In the dynamic process, FTT is triggered based on the current patient waiting time and the state of ED operations. The simulation results provide details and information for the process of the FTT implementation at the ED to reduce patient waiting time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the use of CVM is limited by its inherent methodological weaknesses. A critical concern is the existence of a large proportion of survey respondents providing zero willingness-to-pay (WTP) and that these responses are not amenable to economic theory known as 'protest' responses. Censoring protest responses from further treatment is a common practice, which warrants reconsideration in light of our CVM survey results. The survey involved 800 residents requested to state their WTP for preserving the culturally significant stonewall trees in urban Hong Kong. About 28% of respondents returned a zero WTP. For all respondents the strength of protest beliefs was assessed, and the relationship between protest beliefs and WTP were examined. Our analysis produced contradictory results: some protest items varied negatively with WTP as expected, but other items increased with it Respondents' stated positive WTP harbored latent protest beliefs which are related to non-economic preference. The findings stand at odds with the assumptions underlying the censoring treatment and raise questions about the validity of WTP estimates. These methodological implications should be taken into account in using CVM. (c) 2015 Elsevier BM.

Eli Heckscher held the view that Swedish population growth was quite low in the seventeenth century, similar to the development in the rest of Europe, and that there was a substantial acceleration after 1720. Recent data for Sweden by Lennart Andersson Palm entail that population growth was stronger in the seventeenth century than in the eighteenth century. However, this is at variance with other types of economic data. For example, Swedish real wages increased during the seventeenth century and fell in the eighteenth century. This study attempts to resolve the anomaly and argues that Palm's estimates of Swedish population and mortality rates are too low for the seventeenth century. It presents revised annual demographic data for Sweden for the pre-census period, back to 1630. The new data indicate that there was a small acceleration in early modern population growth, due to the decreased occurrence of mortality crises, but the acceleration was not as pronounced as in the rest of the world.","[Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin] Uppsala Univ, Swedish Coll Adv Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University,"Edvinsson, RB (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",rodney.edvinsson@ekohist.su.se,,,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse,"The author greatly acknowledge financial support from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, and Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse.",,64,15,15,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2015,9.0,2,,,,,167,191,,10.1007/s11698-014-0112-z,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,CG3BS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353152300003,0

However, their potential benefits have received much less attention. If invasive species contribute to livelihoods, their eradication may negatively impact wellbeing. Failing to value these benefits may lead to an undervaluation of invaded ecosystems. We assess the potential economic benefits of an invasive species within an artisanal fishery in Jamaica. We monitored catches over 259 fisherman-days, and conducted 45 semi-structured interviews, with 76 fishermen. We show that the invasive Australian Red Claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) is an important source of income for fishermen within the Black River Lower Morass of Jamaica and supplement incomes during periods when native shrimp (Macro brachium spp.) catches decline. We also show that full-time fishermen and those who have no alternative occupations expend the greatest fishing effort. We use the intraannual variation of fishermen's harvest effort between seasons (when catch per unit effort changes) as a proxy for dependence. Using this measure, we found that the least wealthy appear to be the most dependent on fishing, and consequently benefit the most from the invasive crayfish. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the potential benefits of invasive species within integrated landscape management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Willingness to pay was estimated using a Bayesian mixed logit with two contrasting controls for attribute non-attendance, exclusion and shrinkage. The results suggest that the UK public have an extremely strong preference to avoid a status quo scenario where pollinator populations and pollination services decline. Total willingness to pay was high and did not significantly vary between the two pollination service outputs, producing a conservative total of 379M pound over a sample of the tax-paying population of the UK, equivalent to 13.4 pound per UK taxpayer. Using a basic production function approach, the marginal value of pollination services to these attributes is also extrapolated. The study discusses the implications of these findings and directions for related future research into the non-market value of pollination and other ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite a large literature analyzing market power in the hospital and insurance industries, less is known about the extent to which physicians exercise market power. In this study we make use of a private health insurance claims data set to analyze physician market power for two specialties within three mid-sized US metropolitan areas. Using a method developed for hospital competition analysis, we estimate measures of consumer willingness-to-pay for physician practices within each of these markets and relate these to the prices paid to these practices for a set of physician services. Our results are suggestive of the presence of market power in the markets that we analyze. We simulate physician practice mergers for the two largest practices in each market for each specialty analyzed. Results suggest that practice mergers could result in price increases deemed significant by antitrust authorities in some markets but not in others.","[Kleiner, Samuel A.] Cornell Univ, NBER, 108 Martha Van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [White, William D.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lyons, Sean] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University; Congressional Budget Office,"Kleiner, SA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, NBER, 108 Martha Van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",skleiner@cornell.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; FAIR Health Inc.,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); FAIR Health Inc.,"We are grateful to Keith Brand, Cory Capps, Matthew Eisenberg, Martin Gaynor, Katherine Hempstead, Sean Nicholson, Carol Simon, Amanda Starc, Robert Town, two anonymous reviewers, and seminar participants at the American Economic Association Annual Meetings and the American Society of Health Economists Conference for helpful comments.

While there is an extensive literature analysing the impact of the Irish system of eligibility for free GP care on GP visiting rates among adults, there is a lack of evidence for children. Given the importance of socio-economic health inequalities in shaping the future outcomes of children, it is important to analyse the extent to which the current system of eligibility leads to inequities in access to GP services among Irish children. In addition, some private health insurance plans have started to offer cover for GP expenses, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the existing system of eligibility, and to date, this has not been studied. Using a large, nationally-representative data-set covering two cohorts of Irish children (9-month olds and 9-year olds), we examine the role of eligibility for free GP care in determining GP visiting rates among children. As with the adult population, the results show that, even with controls for child health, and parental and family characteristics, eligibility for free GP care is a significant determinant of GP utilisation among Irish children.","[Layte, Richard; Nolan, Anne] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq,Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin, Ireland; [Layte, Richard] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Childrens Res Ctr, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Nolan, Anne] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Nolan, A (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq,Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin, Ireland.",anne.nolan@esri.ie,,"Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X",Health Research Board,Health Research Board,"This research was conducted as part of the research programme 'The Longitudinal Analysis of Child Health and Development in Ireland' (2010-2013), funded by the Health Research Board.

We found that weekly food consumption of the relatively better off households caused greater environmental burden than that of the less well-off household. Meat and bakery products/flour/cereals were the categories that contributed the largest share of environmental impacts in an average household's food consumption footprint: 58% water, 26% energy, 29% CO2, and 31% wasted materials. Per dollar spent, fruit and vegetables generated 0.0874 m(3) of water, 0.0055 GJ of energy, 037 kg of CO2, and 0.0114 kg of wasted materials. This was lower than the per dollar impacts of bakery products (0.8482, 0.0067, 0.63, 0.0204), meat (0.3471, 0.0070, 0.65, 0.0203), dairy (0.0995, 0.0114, 0.98, 0.0192), and edible fats (0.2373, 0.0080, 0.70, 0.0165). Eating out and fast food consumption also had a low per dollar impact (0.1317, 0.0046, 038, 0.0141). We surmise that substituting fruit and vegetables at the expense of animal products, processed foods, and fats would decrease environmental impacts. Change at low income levels should be focused upon meat, bakery and dairy consumption, while higher incomes should be focused upon the consequences of eating food outside the home.

The Scottish case study reveals a strong relationship between coinage debasement and rising prices, a contention strengthened by the fact that the Scottish experience of inflation was high in European terms, and, in particular, stands at a considerable distance from the English pattern. This study includes the first scholarly examination of prices during the 1540s, and reveals that substantial inflation first emerged during this hitherto neglected decade. Prices plateaued during the 1550s, and rose consistently from 1560 to 1585. Meanwhile real wages declined during the 1540s and from 1560 onwards. This article is methodologically innovative in constructing two baskets of commodities, designed to represent the elite experience, alongside a more traditional basket based on a working household. These reveal the divergent experiences of the price rise within Scotland: rising prices hit the poor harder than the rich due to the high cost of domestic agricultural goods in the subsistence basket and the deflationary impact of wages and luxury goods upon the overall elite basket.","Univ Cambridge, Homerton Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Blakeway, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Homerton Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,55,4,5,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Although Muslim consumers have been studied in several research studies but there is dearth of empirical studies about the perceptions of non-Muslims towards Halal. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the perceptions of non-Muslims towards Halal products and services. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from non-Muslims of UK through snowball sampling technique. In total, 29 interviews were conducted. The consumer perceptions were explored about Halal foods. The qualitative data were analysed for thematic analysis by adopting Spiggle's steps for data analysis. Findings - It was found out that majority of the non-Muslims have positive perceptions regarding the Halal products and services as far as quality is concerned. The themes which emerged from these interviews were quality, knowledge about Halal, acculturation and animal welfare issues. Research limitations/implications - This study will guide the Halal marketers about how to market the Halal products and services from the non-Muslim customers. Originality/value - This is probably among the rare studies on non-Muslims regarding their perceptions towards Halal.","[Ayyub, Rana Muhammad] Univ Hull, Dept Mkt, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Ayyub, Rana Muhammad] Univ Vet & Anim Sci, Dept Econ & Business Management, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Hull; University of Veterinary & Animal Science - Pakistan,"Ayyub, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Dept Mkt, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",drranaayyub@gmail.com,,,,,,,94,37,39,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To address this problem, the Vermont legislature is considering the creation of a Vermont Common Assets Trust (VCAT) that would make the state's atmosphere, aquifers and other resources created by nature or by society as a whole the common property of all Vermonters, present and future. Under the Trust, a board of trustees would have the legal obligation to manage these assets for the benefit of all Vermonters, including future generations. This paper first explains why certain resources are likely to be managed more sustainably, fairly and efficiently as common property than as private property. It then discusses mechanisms for integrating assets into the trust. Estimates of potential revenue from a VCAT suggest that it could eliminate the state budget deficit, contribute to a better distribution of wealth and resources, and help address critical ecological problems. Survey results suggest that a VCAT is politically feasible. The VCAT promises to be an important pilot project that could later be scaled up to a national or global level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Internationally, various studies are related to the importance of SMEs for a country's development and economic stability.

J,"Teng, CC; Wang, YM",,,,"Teng, Chih-Ching; Wang, Yu-Mei",,,Decisional factors driving organic food consumption Generation of consumer purchase intentions,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Organic foods; Trust; Purchase intentions; Perceived knowledge; Revealed information; Subjective norm,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; TRUST; DETERMINANTS; ATTITUDES; ACCEPTANCE; CHOICE; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; COMMITMENT; BEHAVIOR,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how information revealed on organic food labels and perceived organic knowledge drive consumer trust and attitudes towards organic foods, which in turn together with subjective norm eventually influence subsequent purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire surveys were administered to customers at four urban large-scale supermarkets and three health food stores at three major cities in Taiwan. In total, 693 valid questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 81.5 per cent. Findings - Trust, serving as the antecedent of attitudes, significantly mediates the relationships between revealing information, perceived knowledge, and organic purchase intentions. Additionally, both attitudes towards organic foods and subjective norm significantly influence consumer organic food choices. However, the impact of perceived organic knowledge on consumer attitudes has been found to be insignificant, indicating that the increase in perceived knowledge cannot create positive attitudes towards organic foods. Thus, a focus on how to use knowledge to enhance consumer trust in organic foods is suggested as an effective marketing strategy for the organic food industry. Research limitations/implications - The research findings support that trust and attitudes play the mediating roles linking revealed information and perceived knowledge with organic food purchase intentions. This result is consistent with previous studies, indicating that better organic labeling information and related knowledge perceived by consumers have critical effects on consumer trust in organic foods, which in turn will influence their attitudes and intentions to purchase organic foods. However, this study also found that perceived knowledge can generate positive attitudes only when trust can be firmly built. This confirms the essential role of trust in the process of consumer organic buying intentions. Practical implications - First, providing credible labeling information by displaying how organic agricultural products are grown, processed, and handled, and the percentage of organic ingredients in a product is crucial to stimulate consumer trust and positive attitudes. Second, enhancing consumer trust by providing correct knowledge and credible information through diversified channels (e.g. TV, newspapers, magazines, web sites) to improve consumer organic knowledge has become the most important task for the government, organic food sectors, certifiers, and research institutions to develop positive attitudes towards organic foods. Finally, organic food sectors and marketers could use a word-of-mouth strategy and focus on promoting the benefits and accessibility of organic foods to the general public to raise the common acceptance of organic foods. Social implications - Organic labeling has been considered an effective measure to help consumers obtain valid and trustworthy information in the organic food market, particularly for those with limited knowledge. Therefore, the government agencies not only need to take the responsibility to set regulations for organic food/agricultural products, but also need to set labeling requirements for these products. Based on these labeling requirements, the organic certifying agents can certify organic food/agricultural products by offering organic labels that contain clear information and represent quality to consumers. Originality/value - This study incorporates critical factors based on related theories, including the antecedents and the outcome variables of consumer trust, to develop a more comprehensive model for better understanding of consumer organic choice behaviour. The research findings have provided implications and additional contributions to the existing theories as well as developed effective strategies for the development of the organic food market.","[Teng, Chih-Ching] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Restaurant Hotel & Inst Management, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Mei] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University; Asia University Taiwan,"Teng, CC (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Restaurant Hotel & Inst Management, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",chihchingteng@yahoo.com.tw,,"Teng, Chih-Ching/0000-0002-0424-4323",,,,,59,184,196,16,176,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, it faces a range of economic and environmental challenges which require substantial community support. The purpose of this paper is to examine Australian adults' Australian knowledge of, and attitudes towards, Australian agriculture. Design/methodology/approach - Online questionnaire survey of 1,026 adults conducted nationwide during August 2012. Findings - Most respondents had little knowledge of even the basic aspects of the industry but they approved of farmers' performance of their roles. Latent class analysis showed that there are two groups of consumers with low and lower levels of knowledge. The respondents' age, rural residence and universalist values were positive predictors of agricultural knowledge. Research limitations/implications - This was a cross-sectional, quota-based survey which examined only some aspects of agriculture. However, the findings suggest that more communication with the general public about the industry is required in order to build on the positive sentiment that exists within the community. Practical implications - More education about agriculture in schools and higher education is indicated. Social implications - The poor state of knowledge of agriculture threatens the social contract upon which agricultural communities depend for survival. Originality/value - The study highlights the poor state of general knowledge about agriculture in Australia. The findings could be used as a baseline against which the efficacy of future education programmes could be assessed.","[Worsley, Anthony; Wang, Wei; Ridley, Stacey] Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Burwood, Australia",Deakin University,"Worsley, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Burwood, Australia.",anthony.worsley@deakin.edu.au,"Wang, Wei Chun/I-1444-2016","Wang, Wei Chun/0000-0003-4287-1704; Worsley, Anthony/0000-0002-4635-6059",Meat and Livestock Australia,Meat and Livestock Australia(Meat and Livestock Australia),This research was supported by a grant from Meat and Livestock Australia.

We prospectively compared cost-effectiveness of PES to Land Purchases or Easements (LPE) in Central Kenya. We spatially predicted opportunity costs and land prices using household survey and literature data, and sampled conservation management costs from four regional conservation organizations. We simulated a fixed-budget, spatial ecological-economic site selection process for conservation intervention (PES or LPE) over 30 years. We included effects of land markets, property value fluctuations, rising agricultural productivity and climate change. Depending on the scenario, the LPE strategy led to larger reserves (by 26%-610%), better representation of mammal species' ranges (by 47%-112%) and lower unit costs (by 26%-48%). Adding a yearly egalitarian social development payment to the LPE strategy did not increase costs beyond the basic PES model. Our findings were robust to discount rate choice, but cost savings of LPE only materialized after about a decade. Furthermore, Kenyan law restricts foreign land ownership and the use of land easements, thus simpler institutional requirements make PES a more immediate, if less effective, property-based tool.

Our investigation departs from a traditional efficiency analysis and aims at comparing two minimal direct cost functions excluding pesticide expenses. This means that we evaluate the gap between two efficient frontiers instead of focusing on individual farm inefficiency scores. Our only objective is to compare two optimal cost benchmarks for systems respectively defined with high or low pesticide levels per hectare by varying their scale and output mix. A robust approach frontier is introduced to control the influence of potential outliers and unobserved heterogeneity. Based on 707 French crop farms observed in 2008, our simulations show that agricultural practices using less pesticide per hectare are unambiguously more cost-competitive in terms of direct inputs while inducing no other substitution costs. This cost dominance is a robust phenomenon regardless of the size and scope of crop activities, which supports more ecofriendly practices.","[Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lille 3, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France; [Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] CNRS, IESEG Sch Management, LEM, UMR 9221, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France; [Leleu, Herve; Ojo, Oluwaseun] CNRS, LEM, UMR 9221, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France; [Leleu, Herve; Ojo, Oluwaseun] IESEG Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IESEG School of Management,"Boussemart, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 3, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.;Boussemart, JP (通讯作者)，CNRS, IESEG Sch Management, LEM, UMR 9221, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",jp.boussemart@ieseg.fr,"Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/X-3545-2019; Leleu, Hervé/B-5729-2013","Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7932-6940; Leleu, Hervé/0000-0003-4027-5175; Ojo, Oluwaseun Mercy/0000-0003-1901-7382",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-08-STRA-12-05],Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche'' on the project Popsy: Arable Crop Production, Environment and Regulation'', Decision No. ANR-08-STRA-12-05.

For 20 years the technical 'push' to develop accounts proceeded largely independently of the 'pull' from the intended or likely end-users of accounts. Consequently governments have little knowledge of the accounting or how it might be used. We examine why public policy imperatives have not yet pulled environmental accounting into the mainstream and explain how accounting can help reshape government decision-making. As part of this a model showing the place of accounts in the information system and the policy cycle is presented along with a research agenda and principles for the decision-centred design of accounts. We conclude that a phased implementation of the accounts as well as additional research into their applications will be needed to build practical understanding and political acceptance of the accounts.

In practice such exercises are often plagued by incomplete knowledge about the correct specifications of inputs and outputs. Simar and Wilson (Commun Stat Simul Comput 30(1): 159-184, 2001) and Schubert and Simar (J Prod Anal 36(1): 55-69, 2011) propose restriction tests to support such specification decisions for cross-section data. However, the typical oligopolized market structure pertinent to regulation contexts often leads to low numbers of cross-section observations, rendering reliable estimation based on these tests practically unfeasible. This small-sample problem could often be avoided with the use of panel data, which would in any case require an extension of the cross-section restriction tests to handle panel data. In this paper we derive these tests. We prove the consistency of the proposed method and apply it to a sample of US natural gas transmission companies from 2003 through 2007. We find that the total quantity of natural gas delivered and natural gas delivered in peak periods measure essentially the same output. Therefore only one needs to be included. We also show that the length of mains as a measure of transportation service is non-redundant and therefore must be included.","[Neumann, Anne] Univ Potsdam, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Neumann, Anne; Nieswand, Maria] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Schubert, Torben] Fraunhofer ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schubert, Torben] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",University of Potsdam; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Lund University,"Nieswand, M (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",mnieswand@diw.de,,"Schubert, Torben/0000-0001-9546-880X; Nieswand, Maria/0000-0001-6836-0764",,,,,48,1,1,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of the content of the AF was done by watching the three Egyptian children's channels (ECC) for 38 hours. Amaranth, Indigo Carmine, Tartrazine, nitrate and nitrite were analysed in all AF and in serum and urine specimens of children. However, total fats were only analysed in the advertised processed meats and in the restaurant dishes. Lipid profile was also estimated in children. Findings - The AF accounted for 46-54 per cent of the total advertisements presented. The advertised restaurant dishes were predominantly high in fats, 63 and 55 per cent in restaurant dishes and processed meats, respectively. Tartrazine was the only food colourant found in soft drinks and jelly powders measuring 0.2-15 mu g/ml and 25-125 mu g/g, respectively. The average levels of total nitrate and nitrite were higher than the acceptable daily intake of the Egyptian and WHO limits (125 mg/kg). Urinary Tartrazine and serum and urinary total nitrate and nitrite were significantly higher in the viewers' children for the ECC and at borderline for lipid profile compared to non-viewers' children. Research limitations/implications - The most harmful effect of these advertisements is the cumulative effect of AF that undermines progress towards a healthy diet for children. AF may expose children to non-communicable disease in the future. Practical implications - The local policy context requires action to set clear rules for children's food advertising and monitor processed meat products to tackle exceeded levels of nitrate and nitrite. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to analyse colourants, fats, nitrate and nitrite in AF and in the serum and urine of children. This research shows a large number of AF (1,112) in the ECC for 38 hours with statistically significant increase of Tartrazine, nitrate and nitrite in AF (p < 0.0001) and in biological fluids (p < 0.05).","[Abdel-Moemin, Aly R.] Helwan Univ, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Fac Home Econ, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University,"Abdel-Moemin, AR (通讯作者)，Helwan Univ, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Fac Home Econ, Cairo, Egypt.",alymoemin@hotmail.com,"Abdel-Moemin, Aly/F-2764-2019","Abdel-Moemin, Aly/0000-0001-6831-1524",,,,,57,4,4,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These British companies were cross-listed on the London and Amsterdam stock exchange and news between the capitals flowed mainly via the use of boats that transported mail. We examine in detail the historical context surrounding the defining events of the period and use these as a guide to how the data should be analysed. We show that both trading venues contributed to price discovery, and although the London venue was more important for these stocks, its importance varies over time.","[Bell, Adrian R.; Brooks, Chris] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading, Berks, England; [Taylor, Nick] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",University of Reading; University of Bristol,"Taylor, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England.",nick.taylor@bristol.ac.uk,"Brooks, Chris/ABF-4040-2021; Brooks, Chris/C-9033-2016","Brooks, Chris/0000-0002-2668-1153; Bell, Adrian/0000-0003-4531-0072",,,,,35,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2016,10.0,1,,,,,5,30,,10.1007/s11698-014-0120-z,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DA1EJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367538800002,0

Design/methodology/approach - The authors randomly surveyed 12 food pantries (151 consumers) sponsored by the North Texas Food Bank in USA, regarding dietary behavior, health status, reasons for food pantry use, satisfaction with services provided, and self-sufficient behavior and support. Findings - About 37 percent of survey participants would expect to continue using food pantry services for one or more years. Reasons for food pantry use included low job earnings, unemployment, poor health, and disability. Over 83 percent of them were either overweight or obese, and over half (57 percent) of them had moderate or severe mental disorder symptoms that warrant examination by healthcare practitioners. On average, their health-related quality of life was lower than the general population. Participants' physical health was significantly correlated with work intention. The hierarchical regression model predicting work intention had a large effect size. Research limitations/implications - This research has highlighted the importance of improving food pantry consumers' health and self-sufficiency in order to live sufficiently and healthily. Practical implications - Community health practitioners need to help food banks address the needs beyond hunger to focus on the larger ramification of food insecurity such as self-sufficiency and health-related quality of life.

The authors have employed comparative approach in order to assess the trends of defence expenditure in the context of the Baltic States, such as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. To that end, the findings have suggested the following: 1) different trends of defence expenditure and economic growth have been detected within the Baltic States.

The study area was chosen because relatively little energy consumption data are available concerning this geographical location. Design/methodology/approach - The study used both primary and secondary data. The suitable households sample was chosen by multi-stage random sampling technique. The methodology employed to group the households into either food secure or food insecure is by comparing daily per capita calorie consumption by each household with the threshold daily per capita calorie requirement of 2,710 kcal/day/adult equivalent. This method has proven to be efficient in measuring food security at household level. Findings - The results of the study reveal that majority of the households surveyed are food insecure that is their daily per capita calorie intake falls below the recommended daily per capita calorie requirement. The food insecure households constitute 54 per cent, surplus index of 0.36 per cent and food insecurity gap of 0.0038. Research limitations/implications - The greatest limitation to this study is the inability to collect data on the distribution of income, budget share on foods and socio-economic characteristics of the households to determine how their food security status is influenced due to impediments such as time, limited resources to collect a complete dataset used for the study. Also, recalling accurately the foods eaten in the last 24-hour was difficult for some of the household heads especially the aged ones and precise measurement of foods portion were also not accurate in some cases. Practical implications - The findings of the study will help the stakeholders in food sector in policy formulations and also serve as reference for other researchers who will work on similar topic. Social implications - The revelation that majority of the households are lacking in calorie intake will provide guidance for stakeholders in food sector to put in place efforts that will improve balance between food production and accessibility. Originality/value - The study used original data collected directly from the households for the study using structured questionnaires and the reference materials from secondary sources are appropriately cited. Also, it is worthy to note that not many studies have been carried out in the study area on food security especially in the rural areas.","[Fawole, Wasiu Olayinka; Ozkan, Burhan] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Antalya, Turkey; [Ayanrinde, Festus Ayanwole] Fed Polytech, Ctr Entrepreneurial Dev, Dept Agr, Ede, Nigeria",Akdeniz University,"Ozkan, B (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Antalya, Turkey.",bozkan@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Ozkan, Burhan/C-9583-2016","Ozkan, Burhan/0000-0002-9799-654X",,,,,30,8,10,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Packaging is an extrinsic attribute, which consumers tend to rely on, when relevant intrinsic attributes of the product are not available. In the current literature, studies on the influences of packaging features on consumer preferences are mainly related to classical preference evaluation methods like conjoint analysis (CA). The purpose of this paper is to apply both CA and the less known combination of uniform discrete and shifted binomial distributions (CUB) models to food packaging evaluations. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a real case study in this field, along with CA, the author apply CUB models (Iannario and Piccolo, 2010) as a useful tool to evaluate preferences. CUB models can grasp some psychological characteristics of consumers related to the feeling toward packaging attributes and related to an inherently uncertainty that affects the consumers' choices. Both psychological characteristics feeling and uncertainty can be linked to relevant subject's information. At first we detect preferred packaging attributes of fresh food by means of CA, then we apply CUB models to some relevant attributes from the CA study. Findings - Results show that attributes like packaging material and size/shape of packaging are the most important attributes and that biodegradable packaging, reclosable trays/bags and long best by date are also valuable features for consumers. The introduction of covariates showed that specific demographic characteristics are linked to both feeling and uncertainty. Originality/value - The data driven segmentation results give to the integrated approach CUB models and Conjoint Analysis the most important added value.","[Giancristofaro, Rosa Arboretti] Univ Padua, Dept Engn, Padua, Italy; [Bordignon, Paolo] Univ Padua, Dept Engn Management, Padua, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Giancristofaro, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Engn, Padua, Italy.",rosa.arboretti@unipd.it,"Arboretti, Rosa/AAY-6499-2020","ARBORETTI GIANCRISTOFARO, ROSA/0000-0003-1263-0440",,,,,29,27,28,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They support the overall transition towards renewable-based energy and are of key interest to understand how the energy systems and institutional settings in these energy regions changed over time. In this article, a historical and integrative perspective is employed in analyzing the transition process of an Austrian energy region towards energy self-sufficiency. Specifically, (i) an Energy Flow Analysis (EFA) was performed for three points in time (1990, 2000, and 2010); (ii) the institutionalization process was analyzed in terms of the key actors, key milestones, and key factors influencing the transition process; and (iii) an integrative analysis was performed to indicate how the technical and social systems are interrelated. It was found that the most significant changes in the energy region were the efforts made in setting up a decentralized energy system. The co-action of actors from all spheres of society is crucial for aiding energy transition while this process needs to be supported by activities fostering awareness, generate acceptance, and engage the public at large. While there is a clear correspondence between improvements in energy self-sufficiency and the requisite effort at institutionalization, there is also a noticeable time delay between the development of an 'energy vision' and the subsequent impact on energy infrastructure.

We find that both the value of technical intangible assets and the number of firm's patents has significant positive effect on enterprise's value. From subgroup analyses we find that the number of patents has more positive influence on enterprise's value in private enterprises whereas the value of technical intangible assets contribute more in state-owned enterprises.

Due to changes in production technologies, reduction of the surface of nonproductive areas, environmental pollution and improper use of pesticides, the importance of bees in pollination is constantly growing. This applies especially to countries with highly developed agriculture. According to FAOSTAT, in the years 1961-201 3, the number of bee colonies in the EU countries increased by 3 0%. At the same time, the acreage of open-pollinated crops increased more than 3 times. The biggest growth of the acreage was observed in the case of rape and sunflower. The area of these crops in the EU is too large to be entirely pollinated by bee colonies, especially because the flowering time of rape is similar to that of some fruit plants. In addition, sunflower crops are concentrated in several EU countries which do not have a sufficient number of bee colonies needed for pollination of the entire acreage of the plant. This results in losses, on the one hand -caused by reduction of the crop yield, and on the other hand -by the unused potential of plants for honey production.","[Madras-Majewska, Beata] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Apiculture Div, Warsaw, Poland; [Majewski, Janusz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Agr Econ & Int Econ Relat, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Majewski, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Agr Econ & Int Econ Relat, Warsaw, Poland.",Janusz_Majewski@sggw.pl,"Majewski, Janusz/B-6133-2014","Majewski, Janusz/0000-0002-2221-462X",,,,,15,3,3,6,57,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,114,119,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700015,0

Besides, the screenwriters can be inspired to create more classic dialogues and thus to better achieve the communicative function of the film.","[Yang, Yu] Jilin Agr Univ, Changchun, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Jilin Agr Univ, Changchun, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-275-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,65.0,,,,,,248,251,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Law; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Government & Law,BH2BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398733800061,0

This paper takes a firm-level approach to study the link between financing sources and firm growth in India. We start by observing that (domestic) financial underdevelopment should not necessarily constrain all firms' growth opportunities equally, given they can also access other non-bank finance sources such as retained earnings, foreign finance and government borrowings. Similarly, it is unrealistic to assume that similar financial structure will generate homogenous effects across firms. These considerations motivate our research questions of whether financing sources matter for firms' productivity growth and whether this depends on firm characteristics such as ownership and size. We answer these questions using a rich micro panel data set and employing econometric techniques that deal with the potential reverse causality from financial structure to productivity growth. We find that relative to retained earnings, bank and nonbank finances positively affect firm level productivity growth with bank loans having the largest and government borrowings the least effect on growth. Size is found to play a mediating role in the finance-growth nexus: access to bank loans (nonbank finance) disproportionately benefits smaller (bigger) firms. Further analysis around ownership structure suggests that all else equal, it would appear that financial structure matters only for the growth of domestic private firms.","[Girma, Sourafel] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Vencappa, Dev] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Vencappa, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",sourafel.girma@nottingham.ac.uk; dev.vencappa@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Vencappa, Dev/0000-0002-1749-6669; Girma, Sourafel/0000-0001-5815-1619",,,,,37,13,15,0,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The accident-insurance system compensated injured workers and survivors for losses, but initially failed to limit the growth of accident rates. We trace this failure to the 1884 law's faulty incentives and to an initial unwillingness to use the tools built into the law. The government regulator increasingly stressed rules that forced firms to adopt specific safety-enhancing innovations and practices. Econometric analysis shows that more consistent use of the rules and the limited incentives available under the law would have reduced industrial accidents earlier and more extensively.","[Guinnane, Timothy W.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Streb, Jochen] Univ Mannheim, Econ Hist, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Yale University; University of Mannheim,"Guinnane, TW (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Hist, 28 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",timothy.guinnane@yale.edu; streb@uni-mannheim.de,,"Streb, Jochen/0000-0001-7812-7923",Rhein-Westfalisches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (RWI); Yale University Economic Growth Center,Rhein-Westfalisches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (RWI); Yale University Economic Growth Center,"We acknowledge funding from the Rhein-Westfalisches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (RWI) and the Yale University Economic Growth Center.

Spreading of UOR on agricultural lands functions as a disposal solution as well as a source of organic nitrogen, thereby enabling cropping systems to decrease mineral fertilization. The study shows the beneficial effect of two types of UOR on crop yields and the abatement of greenhouse gases. It culminates in an estimate of the economic shadow value of UOR, according to its nitrogen content, while accounting for various farm system characteristics and UOR availability. It is conducted for the densely populated Ile-de-France region, which has large amounts of UOR and agricultural acreage. Per tonne valuation of raw UOR for farming system use ranges from (sic)15 to (sic)7. Mineral fertilizer demand decreases by 18% in the case of optimal UOR sharing between regional farming systems, which leads to an 8.7% reduction in agricultural N2O emissions. Moreover, the per hectare gross marginal output increases by (sic)39 for the region's utilized agricultural area. We use an agricultural supply model, a crop model, and a tool for estimating changes in soil organic matter. The method can be easily extended to other regions of the European Union.

Interactions between the different reward types, farmers' social preferences, social ties and communication are identified. A field game experiment is conducted with Andean farmers in Peru and framed around their decisions to conserve agrobiodiversity as an impure public good. The main results are that PBS schemes could be effective in motivating collective action for agrobiodiversity conservation and that individual rewards are likely to be more effective and less sensitive to social factors than collective rewards. The latter might have a positive effect on conservation when they are shared within socially closely-related groups or in situations where communication and deliberation about collective action are possible.

Spain joined this trend at an early stage and in the 1850s and 1860s some specialised, albeit ephemeral, journals sponsored by the liberal school of economic thought - the Economist School - emerged. However, when these reviews ceased publication, Spanish economists lacked specialised periodicals as an outlet for their contributions. Miscellaneous literary reviews addressing a wider audience represented an alternative for the diffusion of economic papers into educated society, sharing space with many other scientific and literary disciplines. This paper analyses the presence of texts on political economy in four of the most important of these reviews in the period 1868-1914, when Spain lacked economic publications. In spite of not being specialised reviews, these publications played a central role in the process of diffusion and popularisation of political economy as a valuable field of knowledge, acting as a good substitute for specifically economic journals.","[San-Julian-Arrupe, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"San-Julian-Arrupe, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jsanjulian@ub.edu,,"San-Julian-Arrupe, Javier/0000-0001-8896-4215","government of the Region Rhone-Alpes; Ministry of Science, Spain [ECO2012-39169-C03-03]; research groups GRGDEP (XREPP); Gov. of Catalonia [SGR 1345]; Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Capmany; Department of Economic History and Institutions of the University of Barcelona","government of the Region Rhone-Alpes(Region Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes); Ministry of Science, Spain; research groups GRGDEP (XREPP); Gov. of Catalonia; Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Capmany; Department of Economic History and Institutions of the University of Barcelona","Received 6 May 2014.

Analysts commonly need to estimate site-specific effects for areas that lack data on the number of people who use the resource, intensity of use, and other relevant variables. Here, we address issues of applying transfer functions to sites that have sparse or missing data. We present options for estimating data to apply meta-regression models (MRMs) in ways that are scale-appropriate and sensitive to local conditions. Using a case study of the potential lost welfare to freshwater anglers as a result of mountain top coal mining within West Virginia, we integrate: 1) an empirical ecological model of fish community changes; 2) an MRM that relates changes in catch rates to changes in anglers' utility; and 3) a spatial participation analysis that maps trip distribution using multiple survey datasets. We evaluate two scenarios: partial (20%) and full use of existing mine permits. Our conservative estimates of annual welfare loss are $120,500 for the partial scenario and $627,800 for the full scenario, due to changes in recreational fishing catches. These results are sensitive to catch rate assumptions and socio-demographic characteristics that varied widely depending on the spatial scale of measurement.

These have been framed as a 'burden sharing' problem since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Three key difficulties are associated with this approach under a cap-and-trade system, namely the lack of consensus over what is equitable, uncertainty over estimates of policy costs, and lack of political realism and economic effectiveness of large-scale international transfers. These difficulties point to the risk of failure of post-2020 negotiations if these are based on the same premises of 'sharing the emission reduction pie' within a cap-and-trade regime. History has shown that different development paths can lead to similar economic performances with contrasted emission intensities. This paper proposes some insights into what could constitute a way forward, by recasting the discussion about emission reductions from a development perspective. It concludes that climate negotiations should depart from the current framework and shift to a debate focused on choosing a development path that would address domestic issues, while aligning pure climate policies with development policies.","[Mejean, Aurelie; Lecocq, Franck] Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,Ecole Ponts ParisTech,EHESS,CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Mulugetta, Yacob] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy, London WC1E 6BT, England",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; University of London; University College London,"Méjean, A (通讯作者)，Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,Ecole Ponts ParisTech,EHESS,CIRAD, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",mejean@centre-cired.fr,,"Lecocq, Franck/0000-0003-4875-1156; Mejean, Aurelie/0000-0003-2859-3613",Chair 'Modelling for sustainable development',Chair 'Modelling for sustainable development',Aurelie Mejean acknowledges funding from the Chair 'Modelling for sustainable development' (led by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and Mines ParisTech).,,86,7,6,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Many scholars and practitioners, including ecological economists, have cautioned that market-based approaches might modify human ways of relating to nature that are counterproductive to long-term conservation goals. Moving beyond critique, this article invites attention to the reconceptualization of environmental care labor and human-environment relations using the ideas of gift, reciprocity, and affect. Using the case of forest conservation by rural communities in Odisha, India, I discuss how the paradigm of the gift helps us to rethink transactions in ecosystem services, which Might lead to more equitable and empowering ways of sharing of the burden and joy of environmental care. I argue that instead of framing conservation as a burdensome activity that entails sacrifice and costs alone, we need to pay attention to the joyful and life-affirming aspects of conservation care labor and its transformative potential.

Based on Weberian philosophy of science, it is argued that an ideal PES type, strongly embedded in PES theory, is needed to understand their logic. Many broader, empiricist definitions fail to distinguish PES from the larger generic family of positive environmental incentives, thus eroding their meaning by excessive vagueness. Arguably, PES definitions should focus on describing a functional tool, rather than normatively integrating desirable PES outcomes. A modified narrow PES definition is proposed, outlining conditionality as the single defining feature, avoiding the buyer-seller terms, and linking PES to offsite externalities. Extensive explanatory guidelines address many valid conceptual concerns raised in the recent PES literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It has the potential of being catastrophic. We seek to analyze casualty response to such an event by addressing issues such as the creation of surge capacity, casualty prioritization, and the incorporation of self-evacuees in planning. We develop a location-allocation model that locates alternative care facilities and considers triage and the movement of self-evacuees in devising a casualty allocation plan for catastrophic radiological events. The model minimizes the total weighted transportation time of casualties and uses triage results to tactically prioritize casualties, while considering resource limitations. We apply the model to the case study of a radiological dispersal device situation in Los Angeles. With analysis of the resulting optimal plan and sensitivity analyses on the budget of alternative care facilities and on medical center triage capacities, we come up with several rules of thumb for casualty response planning. Our model aims to help central planners respond effectively to radiological incidents and better understand the response supply chain. It can thus help avert deaths and reduce suffering, especially in the current climate, where the increasing threat of terrorism is raising concerns over the next radiological attack being more in the offing than ever.

I will argue that even in the presence of a widely supported international agreement, a non-ratifying country can provide the setting for the emergence of non-state certification programs. This will happen when significant domestic legislation on the topics covered by the agreement is absent, and non-state actors are able to act as institutional entrepreneurs with an interest in implementing key elements of this agreement. By tracing the development of certification programs for the electronic waste (e-waste) recycling industry, I will show why the US, more than other countries, provided an enabling environment for the emergence of non-state e-waste recycling certification. The US's failure to ratify the Basel Convention on transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and an overall lack of domestic legislation on e-waste exports created regulatory gaps that non-state actors were able to fill.

Over five hundred tourist SCUBA divers were interviewed at seven sites across three Caribbean countries representing a diversity of individuals within the Caribbean dive market A choice experiment was used to assess willingness to pay as a function of the abundance and size of reef fishes, the presence of fishing activity/gear, and dive price. Despite some preference heterogeneity both between and within sites, the results indicate that future declines in the abundance of reef fishes, and particularly in the number of large fishes observed on recreational dives, will result in significant reductions in diver consumer surplus. On the other hand, improvements in fish populations and reduced fishing gear encounters are likely to result in significant economic gains. These results can be used to justify investment in pre-emptive management strategies targeted at improving reef fish stocks (namely reducing unsustainable fishing activities and land-based reef impacts), managing conflicting uses, as well as to indicate a possible source of financing for such conservation activities.

We establish: (1) that proximity to the BMF is a statistically significant and positive determinant of nearby house prices in Victoria and New South Wales, i.e. for an average property worth $199,000 that is 10 km away from the BMF, moving 1 km closer will increase sales price by $2000; and (2) a non-linear relationship between in stream flow and sales price which is suggestive of homebuyer preferences for flow that is neither low (i.e. drought flows) nor high (i.e. flood flows). The results provide estimates of the benefits of in stream flow that could be used to inform freshwater ecosystem restoration policy in the basin and are suggestive of regional benefits that accrue to homeowners living near key freshwater-dependent ecosystems in the basin.

An estimated 21 percent of food and beverage service workers are aged 16-19 years. The purpose of this paper is to determine baseline food safety knowledge and associated factors among high school students. Design/methodology/approach - A convenience sample of 231 Chicago high school students was approached to participate in a 34-question survey to obtain information about their food safety knowledge, behaviors, and personal hygiene. Frequencies of correct answers to each knowledge question were examined to determine knowledge gaps. Bivariate analyses were performed to identify student variables associated with knowledge score and regression models were used to examine the associations between eligible factors and knowledge score. Findings - Among the 195 participating students, 70 percent described themselves as Hispanic/Latino and 15 percent as non-Hispanic Black. In all, 12 percent of the students had restaurant employment experience. The overall student mean knowledge score was 37 percent. Students demonstrated substantial knowledge gaps regarding the temperatures for cooking, mechanisms for thawing food, cross-contamination, and vulnerable populations for foodborne disease. In the final linear regression model, Hispanic ethnicity and experience cooking seafood were significantly associated with lower knowledge score and experience cooking meat and cooking alone were significantly associated with higher knowledge score p < 0.05). Research limitations/implications - Students demonstrated substantial knowledge gaps regarding the temperatures for cooking, mechanisms for thawing food, cross-contamination, and vulnerable populations for foodborne disease. In the final linear regression model, Hispanic ethnicity and experience cooking seafood were significantly associated with lower knowledge score and experience cooking meat and cooking alone were significantly associated with higher knowledge score p < 0.05). Originality/value - These data demonstrate substantial knowledge gaps in a predominantly minority high school student population. Given that high school students are a substantial proportion of the food service workforce, they are especially important to target for food safety education.","[Burke, Anne; Dworkin, Mark] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Burke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",aburke@utah.gov,,"Burke, Anne Jeanette/0000-0002-0972-2910",,,,,46,9,11,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main purpose of the paper is to compare this policy option with other alternatives across different values. An analytical framework is used that recognises the inherent complexity of a problem of this nature, in which the financial values are indeed relevant for policy, but other values are also relevant: the economic (in a broad sense), social, environmental, cultural and political. The results confirm that from a financial standpoint, extracting the oil is preferable, but by incorporating the non-monetary values into the multi-criteria decision process, one can plausibly defend the Yasuni-ITT Initiative as the most desirable policy option. Indeed, the social and environmental benefits (or criteria) signalling an economic transition towards a model based on renewable sources of energy, along with the protection of critical environmental and social capital, make up for the financial gap.

The authors ascertained the category of consumers that has more influence on the quality judgment of the salami and investigated on the differences in the sensory attributes perception between consumers with different familiarity. Design/methodology/approach - Eight samples of both Napoli and Mugnano del Cardinale salami were investigated. The study consisted of three parts: first, technical questionnaire submitted to the producers; second, descriptive analysis performed by 12 trained judges, and third, hedonic tests with different consumer categories: low familiar and high familiar consumers, trained assessors, and salami producers. Findings - Manufacturing processes were quite heterogeneous, those differences affected the sensory profiles of both salamis. Hedonic results indicate that consumer familiarity had a significant effect on overall liking of Napoli salami. In particular, both low familiar consumers and producers give the same judgment to all the products. High familiar consumers and especially trained assessors were more selective than the other ones. Differences in the sensory attributes perception between the consumer' categories were found. Practical implications - Europe has a great number of traditional foods as a result its long history, diversity of cultures, and different climates. These foods represent a very important part of the local economy. Thus, the research effort is contributing to better understanding of the manufacturing process of two Italian traditional salamis and to better addressing consumer needs in relation to traditional foods. Originality/value - The experimental procedure used in this study for consumer tests is very original and proved to be useful to obtain interesting results. The proposed research is contributing to enhance the competitiveness of those traditional foods.","[Di Monaco, Rossella; Cavella, Silvana] Univ Naples Federico II, Food Sci & Agr Dept, Portici, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Di Monaco, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Food Sci & Agr Dept, Portici, Italy.",dimonaco@unina.it,"di monaco, rossella/A-2426-2012; GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018","di monaco, rossella/0000-0003-4402-4023;",,,,,21,4,4,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Yellow chili pepper was used as case study. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 183 households was conducted among the population located in middle and high income districts in Lima, because of their higher ability to pay. Choice experiment data were analysed using random parameter logit models (RPM) with and without interaction effects. Findings - The results suggest that there is a statistically significant willingness to pay for organic and Fairtrade certification attributes (ranging from S/4.4 to 9.3). The results also indicate that the higher the income the higher the willingness to pay for yellow chili peppers grown without pesticides. Originality/value - The results provide support that willingness to pay values for particular food certification attributes are statistically significantly associated with the ability to pay even among the middle and high income population in Lima. This positive association between willingness to pay and income is not always present among the general population in developed countries. As such, the demand for certified products would be especially associated with the overall economic growth of the emerging and developing country under consideration.","Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Garcia-Yi, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",jaqueline.garcia-yi@tum.de,,,Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ),Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ),"The research was funded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the project Unravelling the potential of neglected crop diversity for high-value product differentiation and income generation for the poor: The case of chili pepper in its centre of origin.

Findings suggest that producer and consumer prices tend to increase rather than decrease. Results also indicate that parametric threshold approaches may have difficulties in adequately representing price behavior dynamics.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the payment card method to elicit WTP for certified traceable tea and logistic regression model to analyze the factors that affected consumers' WTP. Findings - The results revealed that most consumers in China were concerned over tea safety; however, their WTP for certified traceable tea was limited. Only income and the degree of concern over tea safety affected the consumer's WTP for certified traceable tea greatly. When it came to consumers' WTP a positive price premium, income level, education, and attitude toward traceability of tea significantly influenced the actual premium consumers were willing to pay. Practical implications - The Chinese government and tea producers should pay attention when implementing tea traceability system. First, raising the consumers' income contributes to the premiums that consumers are willing to pay for certified traceable tea. Second, social groups, consumer organizations and tea producers should popularize knowledge of tea traceability. Third, given the low price premiums that consumers are willing to pay, the establishment of viable traceability of tea in China requires the producers and the government to bear some of the cost associated with the implementation of this system. Originality/value - In past studies on WTP for certified traceable food, the study is focussed on meat in developed countries, and the research has expanded range of study, by conducting a survey in China to determine consumers' WTP for certified traceable tea, and by empirically examining the main factors that influence the willingness of consumers to pay a price premium for certified traceable tea, as well as the premium that these consumers are willing to pay.","[Liu, Xiaolin; Xu, Lingling; Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaolin] Shihezi Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Lingling; Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Prov Res Base Food Safety, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Suzhou Univ, Sch DongWu Business, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Shihezi University; Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com,"ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023",,"Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA069]; Study on the Overall-supervision Mechanism and Supporting Policies of Food Safety Based on Traceability System [12CGL100]; Study of Sharing mechanism of additional production cost of the traceability food and government support policy, a general program of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China [12XJJC790003]; Doctor's Subject Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities: Study on Producers' Behavior in Food Safety and Traceability System [20110093110007]; Study of Multiple Simulation Experiment on Traceable Food Consumption Policy based on Consumer Preferences: the Case of Pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273117]","Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China; Study on the Overall-supervision Mechanism and Supporting Policies of Food Safety Based on Traceability System; Study of Sharing mechanism of additional production cost of the traceability food and government support policy, a general program of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China; Doctor's Subject Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities: Study on Producers' Behavior in Food Safety and Traceability System; Study of Multiple Simulation Experiment on Traceable Food Consumption Policy based on Consumer Preferences: the Case of Pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","This paper was supported by Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China in 2014 (No. 14ZDA069); Study on the Overall-supervision Mechanism and Supporting Policies of Food Safety Based on Traceability System (No. 12CGL100); Study of Sharing mechanism of additional production cost of the traceability food and government support policy, a general program of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China in 2012 (No. 12XJJC790003); Doctor's Subject Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities in 2011: Study on Producers' Behavior in Food Safety and Traceability System (No. 20110093110007); and Study of Multiple Simulation Experiment on Traceable Food Consumption Policy based on Consumer Preferences: the Case of Pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71273117).",,19,16,21,4,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Cartel is an agreement under which competitors agree not to compete with each other and presents the most serious form of anticompetitive behaviour. Such arrangements allow companies to exert market power they would not otherwise have by artificially restrict competition with deleterious effect on welfare. Competition authorities around the world continue to declare cartel detection and conviction in competition enforcement as their highest priority. Taking part in cartel can have severe consequences for managers as well for the undertaking. In some jurisdictions employees involved in the infringement of competition law are criminally prosecuted facing financial fines and possible imprisonment. The reason behind it is an acknowledgment by competition authorities that the mere threat of sanctions against managers and personal liability could be a more effective deterrent than the possibility of only undertaking-focused sanctions. The amount of fines imposed for antitrust infringements, and for hard core cartel violations in particular, has notably augmented over the last years. This paper will argue why managers are employed in harmful activities risking imposition of severe fines and adverse reputational impact for themselves and the owners of the undertakings they work for and what are the tools within undertaking that can reduce the risk of being involved in unlawful antitrust practices and minimize the negative impact if anticompetitive behaviour has occurred.","[Pavlic, Ljiljana] Croatian Competit Agcy, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Pavlic, L (通讯作者)，Croatian Competit Agcy, Zagreb, Croatia.",ljiljana.pavlic@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,159,167,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500018,0

The paper also aims to investigate the role of pester power as a moderating variable in the relationship between children's purchasing decision and that of their parents. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using a 26-item Likert-scaled questionnaire administered in February 2013 to the parents of 600 children at two daycare centers and four elementary schools in the city of Qazvin in Iran. The returned and complete questionnaires were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis within structural equation modeling using IBM (R) Amos and SPSS statistical packages. Findings - The results show that packaging and brand have a positive effect on parents. However, children were only influenced by packaging, and not brand. Further, it was found that children influenced their parents during store visits. The study also confirms the moderating role of children's pester power in the relationship between children's purchasing decision and that of their parents. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the study is that the issue of the effect of packaging and brand on children was explored through the opinions of parents. Also, due to budget constraints, images of chocolate products rather than real packages were used. Future research might study the effect of other factors such as peers, socio-cultural issues, and economic status. Another possibility would be to include other variables such as mental involvement and time constraint. Practical implications - The findings of the study might be useful for all manufacturers and suppliers of goods. More specifically, managers and marketing agents in the chocolate industry are recommended to improve children's brand awareness through advertising as a way of making them want to buy branded products. Originality/value - The most important difference between this work and previous studies is its use of children's pester power as a moderating factor in the relationship between the purchasing decision of children and that of their parents. Another good thing about this paper is that it gives the reader an insight into the Iranian context. The results give the manufacturers a better understanding of the factors children take into account when deciding to purchase something.","[Taghavi, Mahsa-Sadat] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Business Management, Fac Econ & Management, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Seyedsalehi, Alireza] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Execut Management, Qazvin Branch, Qazvin, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Taghavi, MS (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Business Management, Fac Econ & Management, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",taqavi.mahsa@gmail.com,,,,,,,84,11,13,2,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The smooth parameter count model (SPCM) allows for a parsimonious parameterization of locally varying coefficients while simultaneously attending to excess-zero count events. An empirical application examines natural gas establishment growth between 2005 and 2010. The smooth parameter model appears to outperform a standard zero-inflated count model.

By definition in such algorithms however, global optimality is not guaranteed. We present a computationally intensive but globally optimal mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model for electricity planning and use it in a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to test the relative performance of a widely used heuristic algorithm due to [28]. We show that the overall difference in cost is typically small suggesting that the heuristic algorithm is generally cost effective in many situations. However we find that the relative performance of the heuristic algorithm deteriorates with increasing degree of spatial dispersion of unelectrified settlements, as well as increasing spatial remoteness of the settlements from the grid network, suggesting that the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithm is context specific. Further, we find that allocation of off grid sources in the heuristic algorithm solution is often significantly greater than in the MINLP model suggesting that heuristic methods can overstate the role of off-grid solutions in certain situations.

In current academic research, the CDM has both been extolled as a cost-effective and vilified as an environmentally and ethically inadequate climate mitigation instrument. Few studies so far, however, have looked into the CDM's potential contribution to socialization-related phenomena such as raising climate change awareness in emerging economies. The relationship with the EU is highly relevant in this context, as the emission reduction credits (CERs) resulting from CDM projects would not have had any meaningful prices without the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This article aims to fill the current research gap by studying the socialization potential of the CDM in EU-China climate relations in four periods, namely initiation (2001-2005), improvement (2005-2007), consolidation (2008-2010) and habit formation (2010-2014). We argue that there is at least a discernible effect and that the underlying causal mechanism involves the emergence and activities of norm entrepreneurs and habit formation through a process of legal institutionalization.","[Belis, David] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Social Sci, Leuven Int & European Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Kerremans, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Social Sci, Leuven Int & European Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3600, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Belis, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Social Sci, Leuven Int & European Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",david.belis@kuleuven.be; bart.kerremans@soc.kuleuven.be,"Kerremans, Bart/AAX-4896-2020","Kerremans, Bart/0000-0002-8997-4885; Belis, David/0000-0002-0797-3740","KU Leuven-Tsinghua Fund (University of Leuven, Belgium); KU Leuven-Tsinghua Fund (Tsinghua University, China)","KU Leuven-Tsinghua Fund (University of Leuven, Belgium); KU Leuven-Tsinghua Fund (Tsinghua University, China)","The authors would like to thank Hans Bruyninckx, Oran R.

Our estimation equations are derived from a variant of the decomposition methods frequently used for measuring micro-level sources of industry productivity growth. By using comprehensive linked employer-employee data, we study the productivity and wage effects, and hence the profitability effects, of the hiring and separation of younger and older workers. The evidence shows that the separations of older workers are profitable to firms, especially in the manufacturing ICT-industries. To account for the correlation of the worker flows and productivity shocks we first estimate the shocks from a production function using materials as a proxy variable. In the second step the estimated shock is used as a control variable in our productivity, wage, and profitability equations.","[Ilmakunnas, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21240, Helsinki 00076, Finland; [Maliranta, Mika] Res Inst Finnish Econ ETLA, Arkadiankatu 28 B, Helsinki 00100, Finland; [Maliranta, Mika] Univ Jyvaskyla, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",Aalto University; University of Jyvaskyla,"Ilmakunnas, P (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, POB 21240, Helsinki 00076, Finland.",pekka.ilmakunnas@aalto.fi; mika.maliranta@etla.fi,"Ilmakunnas, Pekka/G-2264-2013",,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation,"We are thankful to many individuals at Statistics Finland, and especially to Satu Nurmi and Elias Einio for their guidance regarding the properties of the data.

We carefully spell out the differences with conventional TCE and outline analytical steps based on discriminating alignment that enable a TCE analysis of environmental governance of nature-related transactions. We illustrate the approach through the example of wildlife management in Germany. Here we find hierarchical governance (a prohibition) of killing of wolves embedded into a polycentric hybrid monitoring arrangement. In applying TCE to nature-related transactions, we argue that characteristics of nature-related transactions can be subsumed under the core categories of jointness, uncertainty, asset specificity, frequency, rivalry, excludability and social-relational distance. Benefits of this approach include its generating a narrow list of descriptors of instances of biophysically mediated interdependence related to one evaluation criterion: cost-effectiveness. The TCE of nature-related transactions thus identifies sets of stylized contextual factors and aspects related to the governance of hazards of ex-post opportunistic behavior that cut across scales. They can be used as composite descriptors that facilitate analysis of complex multi-scalar arrangements of natural resource governance. We propose the concept of 'governance challenge', derived from TCE, as being useful for building research on environmental governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Along with being a hazard to local ecosystems, milfoil is a nuisance to those who use lakes for recreation, and its presence has been shown to lower lakefront property values. This study presents the first evidence of the effects of Eurasian watermilfoil on the probability that undeveloped properties near lakes are developed into single-family housing units. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Twin Cities, Minnesota region, a duration model of land conversion is estimated using data on new home construction from 1990 through 2005. We find that undeveloped parcels of land on and near lakes invaded by Eurasian watermilfoil are less likely to be developed than their counterparts on non-invaded lakes. In counterfactual simulations, we show that absent spread after 1990, total development would increase in 112 of the region's 650 census tracts by an average of 19 houses per tract.

It integrates landscape ecology and landscape economics and conducts the landscape analysis in a three-dimensional space to provide ecologically meaningful quantitative landscape indicators that are used as variables for the monetary valuation of landscape in a stated preferences study. Expected heterogeneity in taste intensity across respondents is addressed with a mixed logit model in willingness to pay space. Our methodology is applied to value, in monetary terms, the landscape of the Sorrento Peninsula in Italy, an area that has faced increasing pressure from urbanisation affecting its traditional horticultural, herbaceous, and arboreal structure, with loss of biodiversity, and an increasing risk of landslides. We find that residents of the Sorrento Peninsula would prefer landscapes characterised by large open views and natural features. Residents also appear to dislike increasing level of landscape heterogeneity and the presence of lemon orchards and farmers' stewardship, which are associated with the current failure of protecting the traditional landscape. The outcomes suggest that the use of landscape ecology metrics in a stated preferences model maybe an effective way to move forward integrated methodologies to better understand and represent landscape and its complexity.

To date, these new reimbursement models have been focused on quality-contingent bonuses and cost-of-care risk sharing for providers, both of which have yielded only modest success.An analysis of health policy and business strategy literature was performed to identify the mechanisms of how value is rewarded in other industries and to understand the barriers to those mechanisms operating in the healthcare industry. A framework was developed to organize these findings. Rewarding healthcare providers for delivering value can only be achieved by enabling profitability to increase as value increases relative to competitors. Four variables determine a provider's profitability, each of which is considered as a potential lever to reward value with profit. The lever that offers the greatest potential is quantity (i.e., market share). Ironically, this means rewarding value with volume. The major barriers to value improvements being rewarded with market share are identified, and the profound impact of minimizing or removing those barriers is illustrated using a variety of examples from our healthcare system. Trending reforms that rely on quality-contingent bonuses and cost-of-care risk sharing are limited in the degree of value improvement they will stimulate because they rely on ineffective levers to reward value; instead, reform efforts must focus on removing barriers to rewarding value with market share. The framework presented can be used to predict the impact of any proposed reform.","[Christensen, Taylor J.] Case Western Reserve Univ, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Christensen, TJ (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",tjc83@case.edu,,,,,,,44,4,8,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

We focus, in particular, on critically assessing the prospects of managing such fragmentation. We do so by analyzing whether and how (what we conceptualize here as) a bridge organization-the voluntary, multi-stakeholder REDD+ Partnership bringing together state and non-state actors from global to local scales-has aided in managing fragmentation in this realm, through exercising four enabling functions (enhancing transparency, participation, knowledge sharing, and coordination). Our analysis shows that the REDD+ Partnership has partially succeeded in furthering such procedural aims, but that this has not resulted in a scaling up of REDD+ action and finance, its overarching substantive aim. In contrast to dominant views of a bridge organization's modus operandi, we conclude, based on our analysis, that its value lies not in overcoming persisting geopolitical conflicts around climate mitigation and providing a depoliticized context within which to manage fragmentation. Instead, its success lies in permitting dialogue and exchange even in the face of persisting political conflicts over its raison d'tre and functions. In making these arguments, the article extends recent debates on the prospects to manage fragmentation in global environmental governance and provides a critical assessment of the role therein for bridge organizations.","[Gupta, Aarti; Vijge, Marjanneke J.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pistorius, Till] UNIQUE Forestry & Land Use GmbH, Schnewlinstr 10, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany",Wageningen University & Research,"Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",aarti.gupta@wur.nl; till.pistorius@unique-landuse.de; marjanneke.vijge@wur.nl,,"Gupta, Aarti/0000-0003-4908-7453; Vijge, Marjanneke/0000-0002-3024-8838",,,,,50,38,38,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The health care seeking episode is often influenced by the physical and health care infrastructure availability within the neighborhood, need of the health care seeker as well as personal, household, occupational, and latent perception of the users. This empirical study has been developed for two different groups in West Bengal India, firstly based on location and secondly based on the choice of the health care seeker. In case of resident based approach, we focused on the revisit decision of the rural inhabitants who sometime tend to travel to the regional facilities in urban areas. Facility based approach analyzed the people who were at the regional facilities for health care services. We devised scenarios ascertaining improvisation in service delivery, emergency facility and mobility ease at local public facilities might reduce regional tours and instigate higher utilization of the neighborhood health care facility. We develop integrated choice and latent variable models to incorporate latent perception in choice of scenario for instigating revisit decision.

Of course, such services are not free and have been found to have negative impacts on the environment. Responsible stewardship of the built environment requires that efficiency and care in the delivery of services be taken, particularly in the context of sustainability concerns. A significant problem with existing urban infrastructure systems like street lighting is that they have evolved over time using rule-of-thumb planning standards. Given this, systematic assessment and re-evaluation offers much potential for enhancing the spatial efficiency of infrastructure but also the opportunity to explicitly account for environmental impacts in combination with safety and security. This paper applies a methodology for studying lighting in urban areas based upon the use of spatial analytics, including GIS and spatial optimization. Findings and results are reported for a study area in San Diego, California, highlighting current system configuration issues, method development and the potential long term benefits of systematic analysis of public sector services.

Compelling evidence exists that soil carbon stocks have reduced in many regions of the world, with these reductions often associated with agriculture. In a Danish context, research also suggests that soil carbon stocks are declining. The scope of Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) approaches to effectively and efficiently address climate regulation will depend on the spatial distribution of the carbon assimilation capacity, current land use, the value of avoided emissions and land owners' objectives and preferences in terms of participating in initiatives to increase SOC. We map the carbon sequestration potential under different scenarios, value the potential sequestered carbon in terms of marginal costs of using voluntary agreements with agricultural land managers and compare these to the marginal abatement costs curve used in Danish climate policy. The cost effectiveness of reduced tillage as a climate mitigation PES scheme critically depends on the current debate on the net effects of carbon sequestration in reduced tillage practices. Based on existing IPCC guidelines, we find that reduced tillage has considerable potential for contributing to a cost effective climate mitigation policy. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our theoretical model shows an unintended consequence from increased government spending and widening social safety nets in developing countries where agricultural land expansion significantly affects forest cover: there is an increase in deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions from land use change. Our empirical tests show that an increase in total government spending significantly increases forest land clearing for agricultural production in the short run leading to more carbon dioxide emissions. However, there is no long-run statistically significant effect on the steady-state forest cover and carbon dioxide emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It has been participating more proactively and on a much more significant scale, and, as a result, it has had a greater impact on bargaining outcomes, notably in Nairobi, Copenhagen and Durban. Yet, at present, the group remains poorly understood by both scholars and policymakers. Compared to other groups in the climate negotiations, such as the Group of 77 and Alliance of Small Island States, it has received relatively little attention. This paper fills this gap by tracking the evolution of the AGN over the course of the climate change negotiations. In the early years after the Earth Summit, it shows that the AGN faced tremendous difficulties pursing regional objectives effectively, largely due to a number of internal'' barriers to participation, which compounded the structural barriers that the continent faced by making it difficult to use low-power'' negotiating strategies such as coalition building, agenda-setting and persuasion. However, in recent years, the group has become much more pro-active as a result of greater access to material, ideational and institutional resources. These have relieved, somewhat, the internal barriers that the group faced, making it possible for the AGN to negotiate much more confidently and effectively than before.","[Roger, Charles] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Belliethathan, Satishkumar] Univ Addis Ababa, Horn Africa Reg Environm Ctr, Coll Nat Sci, Grad Programme Bldg,9th Floor,Room 903, Addis Ababa 80773, Ethiopia",University of British Columbia; Addis Ababa University,"Roger, C (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",c.roger@alumni.ubc.ca,"Roger, Charles B/Y-3201-2018",,"Africa Initiative at The Centre for International Governance Innovation (Waterloo, Canada)","Africa Initiative at The Centre for International Governance Innovation (Waterloo, Canada)","The authors would like to acknowledge and thank the Africa Initiative at The Centre for International Governance Innovation (Waterloo, Canada), which provided funding for Charles's research, as well as review and editing of this paper.

Yet many urban farms are concerned with other factors in addition to food production, and thus have incorporated social goals into their missions. The purpose of this paper is to identify the social missions of urban farms in the USA, their extent, and explores differences and similarities among farms with varying missions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use primary data collected from a 2012 national survey of urban farmers in the USA. In total, 35 questions, covering the 2012 farm year, targeted production and marketing practices, risks and challenges, information and technical assistance needs, farm size and location, age of primary farmer, and farm characteristics. A multinomial logistic model was used to analyze the social missions of urban farms in the sample. Findings - The authors find that food production is an essential part of the mission for all urban farms. Some farms have social missions, as well, which the survey results indicate are related to food security, education, and community building. The authors find that all urban farms, regardless of their mission, are relatively small and face similar challenges in terms of providing the primary farmer with a living. Farms with explicit social missions, relative to those with a strict market orientation, donate a higher share of food from their farm and are less likely to own farmland. Urban farms located in with lower median income are more likely to have social goals related to building community or improving security food security. Originality/value - Urban agriculture is becoming more prevalent in many developed nations. At the same time, social entrepreneurship is gaining traction. Given the limited ability of urban farms in terms of food production, the social mission of urban farms arises as a possible explanation for the recent growth. This paper provides insight into a new phenomenon, and uses new data to provide insight into size, types of farms, and farmer well-being and address the social missions of urban farms in the USA.","[Dimitri, Carolyn] New York Univ, Dept Nutr Food Studies & Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Oberholtzer, Lydia] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Pressman, Andy] NCAT ATTRA, Butte, MT USA",New York University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Dimitri, C (通讯作者)，New York Univ, Dept Nutr Food Studies & Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA.",carolyn.dimitri@nyu.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [2012-68006-30177]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Funding for this research was provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Award 2012-68006-30177, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative.

As one of the priorities that is determined by the Jurmala City Cultural Development Strategy 2008-2020 is to involve Jurmala residents in Jurmala city's cultural life. In order to preserve the historical heritage of the resort, the Jurmala City Council is seeking opportunities to create innovative souvenirs that would represent the most typical culture elements of Jurmala in an original way. The aim of the research study was to evaluate Jurmala residents' readiness to get engaged in the promotion of Jurmala cultural life. In the scope of the research, the authors used the following research methods: the monographic, logical construction and graphic methods, and a social survey. The data were processed by using statistical analysis and synthesis methods. The research results confirmed the authors' assumption that Jurmala residents support the idea of creating original and socially innovative souvenirs for Jurmala cultural events, yet not all of the residents were ready to actively get involved in the creation of such souvenirs. The research results show that there are opportunities how Jurmala city could promote its resort offerings by means of original souvenirs created by its residents, which feature not only artistic but also socio-innovative values.","[Grinberga-Zalite, Gunta; Licagina, Ginta] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Oganisjana, Karine] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Surikova, Svetlana] Latvia Univ, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Riga Technical University; University of Latvia,"Grinberga-Zalite, G; Licagina, G (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.;Oganisjana, K (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.;Surikova, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ, Riga, Latvia.",gunta.grinberga@llu.lv; ginta.licagina@gmail.com; karine.oganisjana@rtu.lv; svetlana.surikova@lu.lv,"Grīnberga-Zālīte, Gunta/AAG-5618-2019; Surikova, Svetlana/B-2273-2010","Grīnberga-Zālīte, Gunta/0000-0002-0500-4890; Surikova, Svetlana/0000-0002-3025-6344",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,143,150,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200017,0

Many students just finish the technical tasks, but can seldom get pertinent feedback or further advice on future plan.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the nutritional status of children under the age of five and its impact on cognitive function. Design/methodology/approach - The cross-sectional study was carried out in a semi-urban community in south-western Nigeria. The sample consisted of 220 school children under the age of five. Anthropometric measurements including weight, height and mid arm circumference were carried out to determine the nutritional status of the children. Cognitive function of the children was assessed using a developmental checklist developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and their performance was graded as good, fair and poor. Findings - The overall prevalence of malnutrition in this study was low with stunting, underweight and wasting recording 8.2, 6.8 and 1.8 percent, respectively thereby making stunting the most common malnutrition indicator in this study. A large proportion of the children (88.6 percent) had good cognitive performance while 11.4 and 5.5 percent had fair and poor cognitive performance, respectively. Among the various malnutrition indicators measured in this study, stunting was found to have a statistically significant association with cognitive development (p = 0.005). Stunted children have multiple functional disadvantages that persist throughout childhood and poor nutrition almost certainly plays a role. This paper calls for a need for the Nigerian Government to intervene by ensuring that policies are implemented that will ensure that health and nutritional needs of preschool children are guaranteed right from conception. Originality/value - In view of the importance of nutrition for cognition in children, this research has shown that the cognitive function of preschool children can be affected by stunting and it has contributed to global data on nutrition and cognition particularly in South-Western Nigeria.","[Onifade, Oyepeju Mary] Babcock Univ, Teaching Hosp, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ogun, Nigeria; [Otegbayo, Jesse Abiodun] Univ Coll Hosp, Dept Med, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Akinyemi, Joshua Odunayo] Univ Ibadan, Dept Epidemiol & Med Stat, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Oyedele, Titus Ayodeji] Babcock Univ, Teaching Hosp, Dept Dent, Ogun, Nigeria; [Oyedele, Titus Ayodeji] Babcock Univ, Dept Surg, Ogun, Nigeria; [Akinlade, Ademola Richard] Babcock Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ogun, Nigeria","University of Ibadan; University College Hospital, Ibadan; University of Ibadan","Otegbayo, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Hosp, Dept Med, Ibadan, Nigeria.",otes123@gmail.com,"Ademola, Akinlade/AAQ-3223-2020; Richard, Akinlade Ademola/AAL-4855-2020; Otegbayo, Jesse/AGR-5111-2022; Otegbayo, Jesse/A-2120-2008","Ademola, Akinlade/0000-0002-7526-7573; Akinyemi, Joshua/0000-0002-0675-2110; Otegbayo, Jesse/0000-0001-8992-9411",,,,,31,3,4,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was distributed via the mailing list of a UK free-range egg brand receiving 6,378 responses. The survey was mostly five-point Likert-scale based. The same survey was also distributed to a group of animal welfare specialists receiving 34 responses. Findings - Respondents bought free-range eggs because hens are happier (74.2 per cent) and healthier (69.0 per cent) and because they believed such eggs to taste better (57.9 per cent). They rated all the suggested factors that might contribute to hen welfare as important or very important (on average) but believed outside access and fresh air to be most important. Respondents rated the suitability of resources relating to behavioural needs high (suitable or very suitable) indoors and shelter as the most suitable outdoors. Consumers differed from welfare specialists in their views on factors contributing to hen welfare, but their views on resource suitability were similar. Research limitations/implications - The sample was biased towards free-range egg consumers who had expressed an interest in a brand marketed as high welfare. Originality/value - This is the first study to ask consumers what they consider to be important for hen welfare and how they think hen welfare can be improved. Because consumers can affect on-farm welfare through their purchasing habits assessing the degree of agreement between consumers and animal welfare specialists is important.","[Pettersson, Isabelle Claire; Weeks, Claire Alexandra; Nicol, Christine Janet] Univ Bristol, Dept Vet Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Wilson, Lorna Rachel Maven] Univ Bath, Bath Inst Math Innovat, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bath,"Pettersson, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Vet Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",i.pettersson@bristol.ac.uk,"Weeks, Claire/C-9136-2012; Wilson, Lorna R M/I-7961-2016; Nicol, Christine/B-4841-2011","Weeks, Claire/0000-0002-4280-9604; Nicol, Christine/0000-0001-6734-2177; Dennis, Isabelle/0000-0003-1743-9274; Wilson, Lorna/0000-0003-1435-4988",,,,,23,64,66,2,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim of the study is to test if the various indicators describing local government capacity have any impact on changes in arable land use. The study focuses on Estonian rural municipalities. The first task was determination of land use changes for the period 2009-2015. The GIS overlay technique was implemented for this. The second task was a correlation analysis among indicators of changes in arable land use and indicators of local government capacity. Finally, the construction of multiple regression models was the third task of the study. The overall results show that arable land area has decreased by 14.7% from 2009 to 2015. The results of the correlation analysis show that five components (indicators) of the capacity index had statistically significant correlations with changes in arable land use. According to the multiple regression models those factors described approximately one fifth of the variation of utilised changes in arable land.","[Podra, Katlin; Mandel, Merit; Maasikamae, Siim] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Maasikamäe, S (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia.",siim.maasikamae@emu.ee,"Maasikamäe, Siim/H-7951-2016; Põdra, Kätlin/AAX-9824-2021","Põdra, Kätlin/0009-0003-1067-3989",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,132,139,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700018,0

Then, socio-demographic characteristics have been considered to assess whether group's composition differ considerably. Design/methodology/approach - After preliminary literature review and qualitative analysis through focus groups, data were collected with a web-based questionnaire from 495 Italian wine drinkers. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were carried out using SPSS (21.0) statistical software packages. Findings - The cluster analysis based on the three factors identified confirms the presence of different segments of consumers. Four groups were identified and named: Well-disposed; Not interested; Skeptical; Adverse. Cluster analysis confirms that consumers with positive attitude towards sustainable wine and higher beliefs of environmental protection (Cluster 1 and 3) have higher WTP for sustainable wine. Research limitations/implications - One important limitation in the authors study occurred, considering that consumer's answers in a hypothetical environment might not actually reflect the purchase behaviour of consumers in a real situation. Practical implications - These findings suggest that companies, which are implementing sustainability programmes, should understand what type of consumers value positively the presence of a sustainable claim on the label of a bottle. Originality/value - The work adds to the literature on wine marketing by evaluating how belief about environmental protection and sustainable wine certification, and attitude towards sustainable wine segment consumers in different groups. Eliciting WTP via hypothetical situation give us a better understanding of these clusters.","[Sogari, Giovanni; Mora, Cristina; Menozzi, Davide] Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Parma,"Sogari, G (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",giovanni.sogari@unipr.it,"Menozzi, Davide/ABH-4514-2020; Sogari, Giovanni/L-7212-2018; Mora, Cristina/L-9884-2017","Menozzi, Davide/0000-0002-5241-1587; Sogari, Giovanni/0000-0002-2561-571X; Cristina, Mora/0000-0003-3180-5496",,,,,42,55,59,7,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Results of ordered logistic regression show that information volume and quality positively influence VCI, whereas a positive relationship between channel use and VCI was found only at farm level interfaces. Evidences found suggested that inconsistent information systems, lack of information sharing plans, low level of members' awareness about the value of information, and lack of trust to share information were factors that inhibited information sharing in the MBVC.

We investigate preferences for the restoration of mangrove areas in Brazil, using a choice experiment that varies the level and time of restoration. By interacting those attributes, we are able to identify nine potential scenarios that are expected to provide insight for policies and programs aimed to restore the threatened mangrove forest in the area. Conditional logit and scale heterogeneity multinomial logit models are estimated to analyze the respondents' choices. Our findings indicate that, out of the nine scenarios, respondents prefer a moderate restoration (i.e. vegetation health improvement of existing mangrove forest area) in less than 10 years. There also is a strong preference for complete restoration in 11 to 20 years, with complete restoration entailing vegetation health improvements and extension of the mangrove forest area of 20%.

Our design considers different stock abundance levels and the effect that such differences may exert on extraction decisions and compliance behavior. The analysis is based on a framed field experiment conducted with artisanal fishers in central-southern Chile. Our results indicate that, regardless of the level of biological productivity within the managed areas, the combination of formal and informal enforcement mechanisms reduced individual extraction and transgressions more than did formal enforcement alone. However, in the case of abundance, the use of a combination of enforcement mechanisms did not accomplish more than informal enforcement alone in reducing individual extraction and transgressions. We also found that while formal enforcement tends to complement informal enforcement, it may also crowd out efforts from the group to control peers under low biological productivity. We discuss the policy implications of our results for the proper design of TURFs-based fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Discussions concerning efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions often focus on large countries. However, considerable resources have been spent to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by relatively small, open economies. Although, these economies are small players in international markets, international trade has an important influence on their economies. Investigating the outcome of efforts to curb emissions by these small, open economies provides insights into the situation faced by a large set of the world's economies. This paper has three objectives: (1) investigate the outcome of Denmark's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions by characterizing the relationship between Denmark's macroeconomic activity and carbon emissions; (2) determine the carbon content of Danish trade and document the important effects that growing trade with China has had on Danish consumption emissions; and (3), investigate the robustness of measures of consumption emissions under varying information requirements. Our analysis of the outcomes of Danish efforts to reduce carbon emissions suggest two, related lessons. First, small, open economies, should track both production and consumption emissions when evaluating their progress towards reducing carbon emissions. Second, international trade should be considered in the design of environmental policy. The Danish experience indicates that increasing trade with a much larger and more emission intensive country can have substantial influence on consumption emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Finnish industries are aggregated in different ways and causes of bias are studied. The results show that industries with high raw material use deserve special attention in EEIO models. For Finland, particularly problematic is the aggregation of biomass extractive sectors, since the relative importance of forestry causes noticeable deviations. Sources and strategies to prevent errors are described separately for biomass and mineral raw materials. A brief comparison between raw material flows and greenhouse gas emissions is also made. It is shown that aggregation of extractive sectors biases more in material flow analyses.

Knowing how consumers substitute away from high carbon goods and what they choose as substitutes is essential for understanding which goods are likely to result in meaningful reductions in carbon emissions. This paper proposes a model to systematically estimate how consumers will respond to information from a carbon footprint label. Our model uses consumers' value of their individual carbon footprint with own- and cross-price elasticities of demand data on carbon emissions from life cycle analysis to simulate shifts in consumer demand for 42 food products and a non-food composite, and subsequent changes in carbon emissions from different labeling schemes. Our simulation results have several findings, including: (1) carbon labels can reduce emissions, but labeling only some items could lead to perverse impacts where consumers substitute away from labeled goods to unlabeled goods with a higher carbon footprint; (2) carbon labels can inform consumers such that their previous beliefs about carbon footprints matter; and (3) carbon labels on alcohol and meat would achieve the largest decreases in carbon emissions among the 42 food products studied.

To contribute to closing this gap, this study applies a methodology for exploring complex linkages between ecosystem services and human wellbeing. This builds on emerging frameworks for studying multiple dimensions of human wellbeing, drawing on Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to human development. The approach is applied to an empirical case study of three sites adjacent to native tropical forest in western Rwanda. The value of exploring social complexity in ecosystem services research is illustrated through its contribution to understanding a) different types of values; b) disaggregation of people; c) power relations and their influence on trade-offs; d) the importance of multiple land use types in the landscape; and e) changes and their drivers at multiple scales. The analysis reveals that the majority of services valued by forest-adjacent Rwandan inhabitants are not provided by tropical forests but by other habitats. We suggest that more integrated landscape governance may offer synergistic opportunities for conservation and development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, in pursuit of conservation, PES initiatives implemented at the watershed level may conceal the environmental impacts on local communities of private actors funding PES initiatives. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, focus groups and archival research in the Cauca Valley, Colombia, we present the case of a PES scheme in which several commercial water users paid for the conservation of the upper part of the Nima watershed as a means of securing the flow of water upon which they rely. We show how the scheme was predicated upon very selective interpretations of degradation and conservation, and the roles of those deemed responsible for them, that were mobilised by those groups paying for environmental services to the detriment of other water users.

The multidimensional SOR of a country comprises in particular safe livelihood, quality of life, security, monetary stability, supply security and quality of the environment. A mechanism of progress is described involving the search for higher safety and independence of constraints. With innovation and learning in a key role, the mechanism leads to a relative decoupling of resource use and economic value added and a growing share of knowledge generation in the economy. Competition of HTI systems for scarce resources may lead to independence strategies such as enhanced resource efficiency. It may also lead to cooperation of competing HTI systems facilitated by new institutions thus forming an HTI system at higher level of complexity. While the consortium could coordinate their resource consumption within the boundaries of safe operating space, the partner HTI systems would further expand their SOR. Data is provided that net resource importing countries have developed higher material productivity thus increasing their independence from resource supply, and countries with such capability have gained higher innovation capacity.

Theory suggests that a completely credible and permanent commitment to join the gold standard would have zero currency risk or no expectation of devaluation. We find that, even five years after a typical emerging-market country joined the gold standard, the currency risk premium averaged at least 220 basis points. Fixed-effects, panel-regression estimates that control for a variety of borrower-specific factors also show large and positive currency risk premia. In contrast to core gold standard countries, such as France and Germany, the persistence of large premia, long after gold standard adoption, suggest that financial markets did not view the pegs in emerging markets as credible and expected that they devaluation.","[Mitchener, Kris James] Santa Clara Univ, Econ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Mitchener, Kris James] Ctr Competit Adv & Global Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Mitchener, Kris James; Weidenmier, Marc D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mitchener, Kris James] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Weidenmier, Marc D.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Econ, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Santa Clara University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Mitchener, KJ (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Econ, Dept Econ, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",kmitchener@scu.edu; marc_weidenmier@cmc.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Scott Potter, Julie Van Tighem, and Mindy Ngo for research assistance; Christian Echeverria, Aldo Musacchio, Luciano Pezzolo, Matthias Morys, Christian van Rysselberghe, and Gail inner for assistance with data, and the National Science Foundation for financial support.

J,"Cox, ME",,,,"Cox, Mary Elisabeth",,,"Hunger games: or how the Allied blockade in the First World War deprived German children of nutrition, and Allied food aid subsequently saved them",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"At the onset of the First World War, Germany was subject to a shipping embargo by the Allied forces. Ostensibly military in nature, the blockade prevented not only armaments but also food and fertilizers from entering Germany. The impact of that blockade on civilian populations has been debated ever since. Germans protested that the Allies had wielded hunger as a weapon against women and children with devastating results, a claim that was hotly denied by the Allies. The impact of what the Germans termed the Hungerblockade on childhood nutrition can now be assessed using a newly discovered dataset based on heights and weights of nearly 600,000 German schoolchildren measured between 1914 and 1924. Statistical analysis reveals a grim truth: German children suffered severe malnutrition due to the blockade. Social class impacted risk of deprivation, with working-class children suffering the most. Surprisingly, they were the quickest to recover after the war. Their rescue was fuelled by massive food aid organized by the former enemies of Germany, and delivered cooperatively with both government and civil society. The ability of former belligerents to work together after an exceptionally bitter war to feed impoverished children may hold hope for the future.","Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Cox, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,Economic History Society; German History Society; History Project; Institute for New Economic Thinking,Economic History Society; German History Society; History Project; Institute for New Economic Thinking,"I would like to thank Deborah Oxley, Jane Humphries, James Fenske, Emma Rothschild, and Antonia Strachey.

Information from Australia's agricultural census in 2011, as well as a specialized irrigation farm survey sample of 1499 observations, compared certified-organic and conventional irrigation water-use. Census and survey results found some evidence for some industries that organic irrigation farms are less water-use efficient (i.e. water use divided by tonne of output), but little significant difference in water-used per irrigated hectare was found overall (although for some industry sectors notably horticulture organic farms use less water on a per-hectare basis). After controlling for self-selection, regression model results also indicated that organic irrigation farms use less absolute water than conventional farms; use a smaller percentage of water received; and are more water-use productive (i.e. water use divided by net farm income). A lack of significance for the importance of irrigation infrastructure adoption, plus the importance of water-use charges in reducing water demand, suggests a need for governments to reorientate irrigation policy towards more multi-layered and inclusive practices that promote better soil conditions and water management, rather than focussing on providing subsidies for technology adoption.

Critiques of this development strategy typically focus on downtown areas, and many have noted that such processes often displace poor and working class people. Less studied are those areas that have not been fully incorporated into the postindustrial economy and where the struggles around social justice, economic development, and ecological restoration are still being played out. It is this insufficiently informed area of knowledge which this paper seeks to address and as to which we ask: What has been the impact of the green economy discourse in relatively more marginalized urban areas? Using industrial areas of Southeast Chicago and South Seattle as case studies, this paper draws on previously unreported qualitative data to argue that community efforts to promote environmental justice in these areas have the potential to redefine practices of green economic growth to incorporate social equity and community coherence. However, their ability to do so is constrained by the difficulty in challenging neoliberal discourses of the primacy of growth and the need of greening to benefit the consumer class. The paper contemplates the implications of the lessons learnt for greening cities in both developed and developing countries.","[McKendry, Corina] Colorado Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA; [Janos, Nik] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Sociol, Chico, CA 95929 USA",Colorado College; California State University System; California State University Chico,"McKendry, C (通讯作者)，Colorado Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 14 E Cache La Poudre, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA.",Corina.McKendry@ColoradoCollege.edu; njanos@csuchico.edu,,,,,,,80,40,47,2,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional study that analyzed the food labelling of all processed and ultra-processed food products sold in a supermarket in southern Brazil. Findings - A total of 1,071 processed and ultra-processed food products were analyzed. In 88 per cent of food groups, the average serving size consumed was larger than what was declared on labels. Consumed serving size was up to 9.2 times larger than the declared ones in food products with trans fat among their ingredients list and in false negatives and up to 9.9 times larger in foods with fractioned household measure ( p<0.001). The Brazilian population consumes, on average, larger serving sizes than those declared on labels, which may represent a significant intake of trans fats without the consumers' noticing. Originality/value - This study has been performed with the use of a national database on food consumption, as well as the information from a large number of processed and ultra-processed food labels marketed in Brazil. This study is also proven to be important and novel, contributing with information as to the manner in which nutrition labelling has been presented to Brazilian consumers, discussing its possible consequences for food choices, intake, and the guarantee of consumer rights.","[dos Santos Kraemer, Mariana Vieira; Machado, Priscila Pereira; Kliemann, Nathalie; Gonzalez Chica, David Alejandro; da Costa Proenca, Rossana Pacheco] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Nutr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Proença, RPD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Nutr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",rossana.costa@ufsc.br,"Machado, Priscila/AAQ-4446-2021; DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/U-4042-2019","Machado, Priscila/0000-0003-4607-5094; DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/0000-0001-6149-8752; Kliemann, Nathalie/0000-0002-1778-9998; Gonzalez-Chica, David/0000-0002-7153-2878; Vieira dos Santos Kraemer, Mariana/0000-0002-0265-090X","Brazilian national research council (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa - CNPq); Capes Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Brazilian national research council (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa - CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Capes Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","The present study was financially supported by the Brazilian national research council (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa - CNPq) and Capes Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.

Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 755 representative respondents in the UK were collected. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. The theory of planned behaviour was used as a framework for the analysis, with an additional variable, personal norm, which seems to be especially relevant for environmental behaviour. Findings - The results confirmed the expected relationships: the motivation to buy sustainable seafood is increased by a positive attitude towards buying sustainable seafood, perceived pressure from important others such as family, friends and colleagues, and by a strong moral obligation. Attitude towards buying sustainable seafood was the strongest predictor of intention found in the study. To reach a goal of consumers placing greater emphasis upon purchasing more sustainable seafood, both attitudinal and normative messages could be used. Further implications of the findings and the scope for further research are discussed. Research limitations/implications - The study is correlational in nature, thus limiting the causal inferences that can be made from the results. It does, however, help to explain the relationships in explored in the model. Originality/value - This paper addresses the issue of motivation to buy sustainable seafood which has not received much attention in literature, but is an important issue for anyone trying to increase consumer sustainable behaviour.","[Honkanen, Pirjo] Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Nofima, Tromso, Norway; [Young, James A.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",Nofima; University of Stirling,"Honkanen, P (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Nofima, Tromso, Norway.",Pirjo.Honkanen@nofima.no,,,Norwegian Seafood Research Fund [900273],Norwegian Seafood Research Fund,The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund for financing the research project which this paper is based on.

It seeks to argue that the heterogeneity in these effects (partly) stems from the price-perceived quality relationship which is more important for quality-seeking customers. Design/methodology/approach - A multilevel logit model was applied to household panel data on purchases of new yoghurt and sausage products in Germany. The multilevel model allowed to estimate heterogeneous price effects and accounted for the nested structure in panel data. Findings - Significant variation in the effects of gains, losses, and promotions were found. Internal reference prices (IRPs), which served as indicator of loss-averse vs quality-seeking customers, were found to moderate these effects. Monetary losses have less negative effects for customers with high IRPs. Negative interaction effects of IRPs with monetary gains and promotions indicate that quality-seeking customers are less attracted by gains and promotions. Practical implications - The heterogeneity in the price effects confirms the strategic importance of new product prices to influence customers' perception of value. The price-quality relationship is an explanatory approach for heterogeneous price effects and should not be neglected in price setting. The inclusion of customer-specific reference price information yields deeper insights into customers' use of prices to evaluate new products. Originality/value - This study is the first to estimate asymmetric gain and loss effects in the analysis of new product trial. A customer-specific view in price setting is emphasized by taking customer-specific reference prices into account.","[Lemmerer, Andreas; Menrad, Klaus] Straubing Ctr Sci, Dept Mkt & Management Biogen Resources, Straubing, Germany",,"Menrad, K (通讯作者)，Straubing Ctr Sci, Dept Mkt & Management Biogen Resources, Straubing, Germany.",k.menrad@wz-straubing.de,,"Menrad, Klaus/0000-0003-1079-1056",,,,,39,2,2,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A NEW APPROACH TO MEASURE INTERNATIONAL FRAGMENTATION,JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE; EUROPE; LABOR,"Denser networks of intermediate input flows between countries suggest ongoing international fragmentation of production chains. But is this process mainly taking place between countries within a region, or is it truly global? We provide new macroeconomic evidence by extending the Feenstra and Hanson (1999) measure of fragmentation to a multicountry setting. We derive the distribution of value added by all countries involved in the production chain of a particular final good. This is based on a new input-output model of the world economy, covering 40 countries and 14 manufacturing product groups. We find that in almost all product chains, the share of value added outside the country-of-completion has increased since 1995. This is mainly added outside the region to which the country-of-completion belongs, suggesting a transition from regional production systems to Factory World. This tendency was only briefly interrupted by the financial crisis in 2008.","[Los, Bart; Timmer, Marcel P.; de Vries, Gaaitzen J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen Growth & Dev Ctr, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Los, B (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen Growth & Dev Ctr, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",b.los@rug.nl; m.p.timmer@rug.nl; g.j.de.vries@rug.nl,"Los, Bart/ABE-5900-2020; timmer, marcel p/A-7716-2008",,,,,,45,245,267,13,207,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Modernism was crated simultaneously with the development of the publishing and it lasted several hundred years. Postmodernism was formed in the womb of broadcasting and in just a few years it took over the global market which has been under the control of the publishing houses for several hundred years. The two economic crises at the beginning of the 21st century marked the entry of the global media industry into the mature phase. By entering the mature phase, the media markets of the most economically developed countries had stabilized. Revenues were no longer recording high growth rates and some countries have started to record a negative growth rates in the past five years. In the global market, several global vertically integrated corporations positioned themselves by employing the takeover strategies, which pushed out the smaller competitors from the market. The period of maturity had revealed the specifics of the media industry and the need for interdisciplinary scientific approach. Analyzing the development of certain categories of the medial industry in different geographic areas it is clear that threw are significant differences in the degree of their development. This was influenced by various factors of which the most important ones are recognized in the historical development and the cultural diversities of the certain geographical areas. Economies, as a scientific discipline, gave its significant contribution to the study of the media industry relatively late, at the end of the twentieth century and become an equal partner to other sciences that were already represented in the analyses. The media industry, as a typical representative of postmodernism, requires a holistic approach in order to find answers to the asked questions.","[Lozic, Josko] Univ Split, Dept Profess Studies, Zagreb Dept, Split, Croatia; [Roncevic, Ante; Milkovic, Marin] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia",University of Split; University North - Croatia,"Lozic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Dept Profess Studies, Zagreb Dept, Split, Croatia.",josko.lozic@gmail.com; ante.roncevic@gmail.com; rektor@unin.hr,"Rončević, Ante/AFJ-9804-2022; Rončević, Ante/AAF-6878-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,311,323,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500033,0

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,812 students, enrolled at 72 Swedish schools, analysed the temperature on different shelves in their family refrigerator using thermometers (Moller-Therm (+0.5/-0.1 degrees C) and instructions provided by their teachers. A questionnaire dealing with the issues of date labelling, food safety, refrigerator storage and food wastage was completed by the teachers. Findings - The temperature at the back of middle shelves was coldest (average 4.8 degrees C; SD 3.1). A relatively high proportion of food items were stored at higher temperatures than recommended. The use-by date had been exceeded for 30 per cent of products, but the students did not rate these as inedible. According to the teachers, the investigation increased interest and knowledge among their students of date labelling, food hygiene, refrigerator storage and food waste. Research limitations/implications - Thermometers were used to measure air temperature on different shelves in the family refrigerator. Data collection was not controllable, as the students measured without supervision. Practical implications - The teachers reported that the study increased interest and knowledge among their students regarding cold food storage. Social implications - This way of teaching food safety would meet the aim of generally increasing food safety knowledge in society, which might have a positive impact on public health. Originality/value - The use of school-children as data collectors to determine refrigerator temperatures in private homes is a novel approach, which was an efficient way of teaching relevant facts as well as collecting large amounts of data.","[Marklinder, Ingela] Uppsala Univ, Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden; [Erikkson, Mattias K.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Marklinder, I (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Food Nutr & Dietet, Uppsala, Sweden.",Ingela.Marklinder@ikv.uu.se,"Eriksson, Mattias/AAF-3553-2019","Eriksson, Mattias/0000-0001-5586-0372",Vetenskap Allmanhet,Vetenskap Allmanhet,"Thanks to Vetenskap & Allmanhet for funding the project, Lotta Tomasson for organising it and Dr Inger Persson, Department of Statistics, Uppsala University, for invaluable assistance with data analysis.

The Republic of Serbia strives not to only fulfill the criteria set for the public debt be kept under 60% of GDP, but to decrease it to 45% of GDP. Taking into consideration the fiscal aggregates before and after the application of the fiscal measures in the following three year period it is shown that the measures should be applied further than this timeframe in order to fulfill the criteria needed to join the European Union. Based on the predictions shown in this paper it is clear that the Republic of Serbia will not be able to fulfill these criteria if it does not conduct a restrictive fiscal policy, which is inclusive in responding to the question of a structural deficit, a tax reform and an overall reform of the public sector, which is a good way to achieve the results predicted by the Maastricht convergence criteria, although not in the timeframe set by the Government of the Republic of Serbia.","[Stakic, Ana Jovancai; Stokanovic, Jovana] Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Stakic, AJ (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",ajovancai@megatrend.edu.rs; jstokanovic@megatrend.edu.rs,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,324,332,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500034,0

Despite the substantial increase in such photos, there have been few investigations into how prospective consumers respond to this visual UGC. We begin to address this gap by investigating the role of the color compositions of visual UGC in consumer response. Consumer response is operationalized as the click-rate for a photo by a consumer when it is curated on the online site of the brand that it includes. This is the proportion of visitors who click on it for an enlarged view. Composition is operationalized as the specific combination of levels of the photo's color attributes: hue, chroma, and brightness. Our goal is to identify the color compositions of photos, ceteris paribus, which get more clicks when they are curated. Data for our investigation comes from clicks over a one-year period on photos posted on Instagram curated by fifteen brands in six product categories on their sites. We assume Beta distributed proportions and calibrate a Beta regression using MCMC methods for our investigation. We find that click-rates are higher for photos that include higher proportions of green and lower proportions of red and cyan. We also find that chroma of red and blue are higher in photos with higher click-rates. Findings from our research led the sponsoring firm to modify its proprietary curation algorithm for client brands. The firm informed us that, post-modification, there has been a substantial increase in click-rates of curated photos for brands in several categories.","[Jalali, Nima Y.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Belk Coll Business, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Papatla, Purushottam] Univ Wisconsin, Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Papatla, P (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",nima.jalali@uncc.edu; papatla@uwm.edu,,"Papatla, Purushottam/0000-0001-8502-3575",,,,,81,12,16,3,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We give a set of sufficient conditions for which collusion is a subgame-perfect equilibrium; that is, the threat of punishing any deviator is credible. We then show that reducing current duration always breaks down market discipline, and so does an increase in duration for innovative treatments.

Using detailed data on individual markets' evolutions, I find that for-profit facilities were quicker to enter growing markets and slower to exit declining ones than non-profit facilities. Moreover, for-profit providers' presence in a market had a larger impact on the exit and entry behavior of competitors. These results suggest that for-profit dialysis providers have an advantage in static competition relative to non-profit providers, and that this-rather than lower entry costs-explains their increasing prominence. Additional empirical analyses indicate that for-profits' advantage cannot solely be attributed to efficiencies related to membership in a large, multi-facility chain. This further suggests that managerial incentives have had an economically significant impact on long-run market structure in this industry.","[Wilson, Nathan E.] Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Wilson, NE (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",nwilson@ftc.gov,,"Wilson, Nathan/0000-0001-5548-9796",,,,,51,5,9,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Yet the meaning of experiment varies markedly across these domains. We survey the diversity of experimentation, identifying three distinct experimental logics-controlled, Darwinian, and generative. Building on Pragmatist philosophy, we argue that each of these logics has different strengths and weaknesses, but taken together they offer a valuable experimentalist approach to environmental problem-solving. However, from a transdisciplinary perspective, it is important to recognize the different values, purposes, and stances toward knowledge that they entail. Controlled experiments primarily aim to isolate causality, while Darwinian experimentation endeavors to enhance systemic innovation and generative experimentation seeks to generate new solution concepts. Appreciating these differences allows us to be more reflexive about an experimentalist agenda, illuminating the appropriate role of these logics and suggesting possibilities for fruitfully combining them. To advance this reflexive agenda, we also distinguish between epistemic and political learning and argue that experimental approaches to environmental problem-solving may benefit from being more sensitive to this distinction.

The results indicate that the economic activity-environment trade-off of 'dirty' and 'clean' industrial sectors has been altered during the period of study. On average, pollution-intensive 'dirty' industries in the poorer nations were found to benefit - in terms of BOD emissions - from extra exports and openness to trade. The opposite was true for 'clean' sectors where increased trade openness seems to have contributed to a wider gap between poorer and richer nations' pollution intensities. With openness to trade skewing innovations away from the 'clean' industries - industrial sectors in which the poorer countries specialize - the classical model of opening the economy and lifting barriers to technology adoption will not be enough to improve the poorer nations' water quality. Policies that induce innovation by reducing the cost and increasing the return on innovation, particularly on R&D activities in which the poorer countries have a comparative advantage, will be necessary in order to improve their economic activity environment relationship.

It surveys the fiscal and constitutional outcomes of independence and assesses the relative burden imposed by colonialism. Constitutional asymmetries between revenue collecting and spending agents constrained de facto governments' power to tax. Inherent disparities embedded in the colonial fiscal system worsened with vaguely defined representation for subjects and territories and vexed their aggregation into a modern representative polity. Governments with limited fiscal capacity failed to deliver public goods and to distribute the costs and benefits of independence equitably. Growing indirect taxes, debt and money creation allowed them to transfer the fiscal burden to other constituents or future generations. Taxpayers became aware of the asymmetry between private contributions and public goods and hence favoured a low but regressive taxation. Comparisons with trajectories in the metropolis and the United States are offered to qualify this legacy.","[Irigoin, Alejandra] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Irigoin, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.a.irigoin@lse.ac.uk,,"Irigoin, Alejandra/0000-0001-5395-1537",,,,,98,7,9,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The financial impact of physician-owned specialty hospitals,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hospital ownership; Hospital reimbursement; Market structure; Specialty hospital,OWNERSHIP; QUALITY,"The U.S. hospital industry has recently witnessed a number of policy changes aimed at aligning hospital payments to costs and these can be traced to significant concerns regarding selection of profitable patients and procedures by physician-owned specialty hospitals. The policy responses to specialty hospitals have alternated between payment system reforms and outright moratoriums on hospital operations including one in the recently enacted Affordable Care Act. A key issue is whether physician-owned specialty hospitals pose financial strain on the larger group of general hospitals through cream-skimming of profitable patients, yet there is no study that conducts a systematic analysis relating such selection behavior by physician-owners to financial impacts within hospital markets. The current paper takes into account heterogeneity in specialty hospital behavior and finds some evidence of their adverse impact on profit margins of competitor hospitals, especially for-profit hospitals. There is also some evidence of hospital consolidation in response to competitive pressures by specialty hospitals. Overall, these findings underline the importance of the payment reforms aimed at correcting distortions in the reimbursement system that generate incentives for risk-selection among providers groups. The identification techniques will also inform empirical analysis on future data testing the efficacy of these payment reforms.","[Chakravarty, Sujoy] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr State Hlth Policy, 112 Paterson St,Room 548, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Chakravarty, S (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Ctr State Hlth Policy, 112 Paterson St,Room 548, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",schakravarty@ifh.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

We examine four ethical, principles that speak to different notions of fairness in the way this burden can and should be shared, and use them to produce three normative criteria for pursuing fairness in the clean energy fiscal policy context. We use these criteria to examine the extent to which fairness is being achieved in large clean energy roll-out programs in Australia, California and the United Kingdom. Maintaining a close focus on providing practical guidance for decision makers in similar policy contexts, we find that fairness is more achievable when program design explicitly considers which households should pay for the program and which should be exempt; when the idea of proportionality guides the distribution of the cost across paying households, and when the interests of low-income households are protected, by ensuring that they share in the benefits of the program, for example.

We show that such discounts may be used to shift just enough channel profits to dealers to enable them to cover their fixed costs and stay in business. If the manufacturer instead simply cut his wholesale price in order to generate gross margins for his dealers, these margins would soon dissipate as price competition among dealers selling the same product forced retail prices back down to the per-unit cost. We show that when dealer fixed costs are low, the manufacturer offers an Early Bird Discount to his multiple dealers that induces all but two of them to exit; when fixed costs are high, the manufacturer offers no preorder discount (i.e. switches to linear pricing) and induces all but one dealer to exit. Although uniform slotting allowances could also be used to reward dealers, a sales-based alternative like an Early Bird Discount sometimes has a key advantage when the manufacturer has dealers in cities of different sizes. If the same Early Bird Discount is offered, dealers in markets with more consumers, who typically have larger fixed costs, will preorder larger amounts and will automatically receive higher gross margins. To duplicate such payments with slotting allowances, non-uniform allowances would have to be offered to firms in different markets, which is divisive and possibly illegal.","[Lo, Desmond (Ho-Fu)] Santa Clara Univ, 500 El Camino Rd,Lucas Hall 221K, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Salant, Stephen W.] Univ Maryland, 2213 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Salant, Stephen W.] Univ Michigan, 611 Tappan St,Lorch Hall 254, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Santa Clara University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lo, D (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, 500 El Camino Rd,Lucas Hall 221K, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",hlo@scu.edu,"Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,,30,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

To fill this gap, we assess perspectives of wine producers and residents regarding CES provided by vineyards in two wine regions: Southeast England, an emerging wine area, and the counties of Sonoma and Napa, California (hereafter: Sonoma and Napa), a more traditional wine area. We used Q-methodology to reveal the perspectives expressed by participants from both areas, each of whom ranked 44 Q-statements. We found that wine producers and local residents have different perceptions. In Southeast England, wine producers are more positive about vineyard landscapes than residents. Wine producers in Sonoma and Napa value CES directly connected with wine production, while residents emphasize CES that benefit nature conservation or entertainment. Comparing the regions, we conclude that Southeast England vineyards represent sometimes unwelcome development to residents, while in Sonoma and Napa they represent conservation of nature and tradition. Our findings show that perspectives on CES are experience- and context-dependent, as the perspectives on vineyards of residents and wine producers are strongly held but vary widely. Understanding these perspectives will help land use planners and regional politicians make better decisions for optimizing available CES. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Notably, Italy has been one of the countries that has experienced the most severe reduction in public expenditure in the education sector. In the described conditions, Italian governmental institutions have started to perform rationalisation actions, aimed at modifying the current configuration of the existing facilities offering educational services (either by entirely closing and merging some of them, or by downsizing or transferring capacities), in order to increase the affordability of the system while still providing a required minimum service level. These strategic choices may have a lasting impact; therefore, there is a need for appropriate decision support tools capable of assisting planners. For this reason, after a description of the context and a review of the current literature, this paper presents two novel mathematical models for addressing rationalisation decisions in the Italian education system. The usability of such models is tested by means of real-world case studies, offering interesting insights. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find reciprocal relationship between health expenditure and economic growth in the short run and one-way causality from economic growth to public health expenditure in the long-run. In high-income countries, there is a two-way causality for both private and public health expenditures in the short-run, while in the long-run there is a one-way causality between economic growth and private health expenditures. The crucial finding of this study is that private health expenditures have negative influence on economic growth while public health expenditures have both negative and statistically significant effect.","[Halici-Tuluce, Nadide Sevil] Meliksah Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kayseri, Turkey; [Dogan, Ibrahim] Bozok Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Yozgat, Turkey; [Dumrul, Cuneyt] Erciyes Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kayseri, Turkey",Meliksah University; Bozok University; Erciyes University,"Dumrul, C (通讯作者)，Erciyes Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kayseri, Turkey.",ntuluce@meliksah.edu.tr; ibrahim.dogan@bozok.edu.tr; cdumrul@erciyes.edu.tr,"Dumrul, Cüneyt/A-6346-2018; Doğan, İbrahim/AAH-1806-2021","Dumrul, Cüneyt/0000-0002-6787-2001;",,,,,86,36,38,2,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

This can shift the economically optimal rotation age, and incorporate rents for a wider range of ecosystem service offerings. A mixed stand economic optimization model was used to determine the optimal stand mixture and inter-species climate regulation trade-offs. Mixed forest dynamics between deciduous silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and coniferous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) were evaluated. The sensitivity of our results to the absolute species-specific differences in albedo parameter values was also conducted. Results indicated that a synergistic climate regulation trade-off between the two species exists. The optimal rotation for the combined carbon storage and albedo effect was equivalent to that of the carbon storage only case. Differences in absolute albedo impacts were most sensitive at high discount rates, for 'climate only' management, and over increasing offset prices. These results demonstrate the importance of parameter certainty in the promotion of PES in forestry. They also show that mixed stands can promote more efficient trade-offs between forest ecosystem service offerings and provide a basis for diversifying between ecosystem functions.

These are linked to their childhood circumstances as observed in the 1901 census. Econometric results indicate that height on enlistment was positively related to socio-economic class, and negatively to the number of children in the household in 1901 and the proportion of household members who were earners, as well as to the degree of crowding. Adding the characteristics of the locality has little effect on the household-level effects. However local conditions were important; in particular the industrial character of the district, local housing conditions, and the female illiteracy rate. These are interpreted as representing the negative effect on height of the local disease environment. The results suggest that changing conditions at both household and locality levels contributed to the increase in height and health in the following decades.",,,,,,"Inwood, Kris/0000-0002-3533-7047",ANU College of Economics and Business for a Research School Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [41020092342],ANU College of Economics and Business for a Research School Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank the ANU College of Economics and Business for a Research School Grant and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for financial support under grant no. 41020092342.

Design/methodology/approach - A telephone survey (n = 1,328) was conducted in the province of San Jose, where the capital city is located. This location has a population of 845,000, with a 99 per cent, confidence, 1 per cent error and 50 per cent response distribution, the total usable surveys were 1,199. The analytical procedure, consisted of three steps; instrument validation, consumer profile development and developing ordinal logistic modelling. Findings - The total a was estimated at 0.71. The coffee consumer profile is described but consisted of 52 per cent female and 48 per cent male with 77 per cent receiving a secondary education. The factors influencing coffee drinking by Costa Ricans, are in order of importance: first gender followed by family as a source of information, health, amount spent, aroma, anti-migraine effect, family tradition, flavour and energizing effect. H1 - health, culture and gender influence the frequency of coffee consumption in Costa Rica is accepted; H2 - the importance of the health factor varies with gender is accepted and H3 - culture is an important factor in determining coffee consumption is also accepted. Research limitations/implications - The study was only conducted in the province of San Jose. This is considered the urban heart of the country urban but its finding should not be extrapolated to the entire country. A rural/urban comparison may be needed. Practical implications - The results suggest that a country wide survey may be useful in providing information for differential coffee marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire based on the Food Choice Questionnaire was applied to 1,202 consumers. A factor analysis and a cluster analysis were performed on the data. Findings - Ten factors were identified: care for weight and health, social sensitivity, practicality, economic aspects, non-industrialized, hedonism, traditionality A, familiarity, traditionality B, and no added sugar. Resulting clusters were named as: traditional, healthy, conscious, and careless. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found due to gender, age, marital status, and educational level, but not for body mass index. There are signs of different consumers, but it seems that Mexican consumers in general express low sensitivity to issues of health and nutrition, even more so towards animal welfare and products that are friendly to the environment. Research limitations/implications - The large diversity of motivations and behaviours in food consumption in Mexico are not all addressed in this study. However, this work opens a new area of research in Mexico so that in the near future studies on the diversity of Mexican consumers are undertaken, looking at the transformation of their food preferences. Practical implications - In Europe, governments have addressed the new forms of consumption taking advantage of opportunities that benefit local producers, through the generation of added value as Protected Designations of Origin (DOP), geographical indications, collective brands, ecological produce, local products of the land, among others. These proposals are promoted as a path to follow in Latin America, assuming that Latin American consumers have the same characteristics or interests as in those developed countries. But, not knowing consumers motives of preference represents a problem in the processes of valorization of food products. Social implications - Economic development, demographic, and sociocultural changes in Latin America have promoted phenomena both in the polarization of livelihoods in their societies as well as changes of lifestyles in different social strata. Therefore, studies are needed on the effect of these changes not only in food consumption, but also on the symbolic elements when consumers choose their food. Originality/value - In Mexico, the study of food consumption has followed diverse approaches, as a matter of policy, from an economic perspective, from anthropology, particularly focussed on indigenous cultures, from the nutrition and health field or emphasizing economic aspects. As in other developing countries, those works do not address the role of the consumer and their motivations, so that research that studies their motives in the choice of foods is needed.","[Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica; Galdino Martinez-Garcia, Carlos; Thome-Ortiz, Humberto; Vizcarra-Bordi, Ivonne] Autonomous Univ State Mexico, Inst Agr & Rural Sci, Toluca, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico,"Espinoza-Ortega, A (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ State Mexico, Inst Agr & Rural Sci, Toluca, Mexico.",angelica.cihuatl@gmail.com,"Martinez-Garcia, Carlos Galdino/B-1452-2016; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/D-7453-2016; Thome Ortiz, Humberto/B-5869-2015","Martinez-Garcia, Carlos Galdino/0000-0001-9924-3376; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/0000-0002-5968-0587; Thome Ortiz, Humberto/0000-0002-6714-3490",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-CONACYT) [220531CB-2013],Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This work was undertaken thanks to the funding by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) through Grant No. 220531CB-2013.,,58,33,36,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional qualitative research design was employed to examine managerial experience and perceptions of barriers and drivers to organizational adoption of HACCP FSMS procedures. The data were collected in 20 food processing facilities in the dairy industry through individual in-depth interviews with their representatives and in governmental and non-governmental organizations through focus group discussions with 23 policy makers and food safety consultants. Diffusion of innovations theory provided a framework for systematic exploration of the phenomenon under study. Findings - Most frequently reported drivers of adoption included enhanced traceability, increased export opportunities, improved organizational image, and broader accountability. Major impeding factors, such as high investment costs, value incompatibility, excessive documentation, inadequate physical and technological infrastructures, and low observability led to less favorable attitudes toward the organizational change needed for HACCP FSMS adoption. The results indicate that larger organizations with well-developed infrastructures and skilled workforce have an advantage over smaller organizations in the process of adoption. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive theory-based analysis of perceived determinants of organization-wide adoption of HACCP-based system in Armenia. The results of the study support and extend the findings of earlier research and provide new insights into HACCP FSMS adoption across different contexts.","[Galstyan, Suren H.; Harutyunyan, Tsovinar L.] Amer Univ Armenia, Sch Publ Hlth, Yerevan, Armenia",American University of Armenia,"Galstyan, SH (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Armenia, Sch Publ Hlth, Yerevan, Armenia.",surgalstyan@gmail.com,"Galstyan, Suren H./P-9680-2015","Galstyan, Suren H./0000-0002-2852-2359",School of Public Health at American University of Armenia,School of Public Health at American University of Armenia,"This study was supported by the School of Public Health at American University of Armenia.

It has been found that in Poland there are significant regional disparities in agricultural production, which may result in different impact on the environment in every region. Poland is a country with good conditions for agricultural production, although in recent years the agricultural area has decreased significantly. Over the last decade, most provinces recorded a significant increase in the use of mineral fertilisers. This is not positive for the natural environment but the level of fertilisation in Poland is far from that, which exists among others in Western Europe. Another negative factor is the increase in stocking density in some regions. The analyses carried out show that in Poland there are areas, where too intense agricultural production may have an adverse impact on the natural environment.","[Golebiewska, Barbara] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Golebiewska, B (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",barbara_golebiewska@sggw.pl,"Gołębiewska, Barbara BG/F-3535-2019","Golebiewska, Barbara/0000-0003-4073-5274",,,,,21,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,52,58,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700006,0

Design/methodology/approach - A 100 salad samples were collected aseptically. Each sample (25 g) was homogenized in 225 ml of sterile peptone water and was serially diluted up to 1x106. Dilutions were inoculated on nutrient agar by surface spread plate technique. Aerobic colony count (ACC) was estimated by counting the colonies. Bacterial isolates were cultured on blood and MacConkey agar and identified on the basis of their morphology, culture characteristics and confirmed by API 20E and 20NE. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined as per CLSI 2014. Findings - ACC range was 1.1x103 cfu/g to 5.8x109 cfu/g. Among these the highest ACC was found in channa chat (4.9x104 to 5.8x109 cfu/g). A total of 127 microorganisms were identified; 73 were gram negative rods (GNRs) and 24 were gram positive cocci (GPC). Among GNRs; Klebsiella spp. (n = 18) was the predominant whereas among GPC, Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6) were the chief pathogen. Klebsiella spp. showed 100 percent resistance to ampicillin, 89-78 percent to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 33 percent to imipenem, however, Enterobacter spp. were resistant to ampicillin (100 percent) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (77 percent) and imipenem (23 percent). Staphylococcus aureus showed resistance to co-amoxiclav (83 percent) and penicillin (75 percent). Practical implications - This study revealed that effective control measures must been implemented and respected by throughout the entire food chain and better surveillance studies should be performed at national level to reduce the spread of bacteria by fresh salads. Originality/value - This paper explore the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens in different salads and most of the salads were found to be unhygienic for consumption.","[Ilyas, Sana; Qamar, Muhammad Usman; Rasool, Muhammad Hidayat; Abdulhaq, Nazia; Nawaz, Zeeshan] Univ Faisalabad, Govt Coll, Dept Microbiol, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Government College University Faisalabad,"Nawaz, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Faisalabad, Govt Coll, Dept Microbiol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",zeeshannawaz@gcuf.edu.pk,"Hidayat Rasool, Muhammad/JOZ-0989-2023; Nawaz, Muhammad Zeeshan/JOP-7817-2023; Qamar, Muhammad/GPW-8701-2022; Qamar, Muhammad Usman/AAW-9260-2021","Qamar, Muhammad Usman/0000-0002-2636-238X; Nawaz, Zeeshan/0000-0002-4673-2579",,,,,25,9,9,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, existing studies on organic food have lacked a strong theoretical foundation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships among purchase intention and the properties, certification mechanisms, retail channels, and prices of organic food from multiple theoretical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - Using a rigorous sampling design, 507 valid questionnaires collected from consumers at four well-known organic food markets, and the hypotheses were tested based on a linear structural equation model. Findings - The results of the structural equation model analysis showed the following: consumer attitudes toward organic food labeling/certification institutions had a positive impact on the trust in food labeling; channel dependence positively influenced the relational embeddedness in a channel; the effect of the nutritional value of organic food on environmental protection also had a positive impact on attitudes toward organic foods; attitudes toward trust in the organic label, relational embeddedness in a channel, and attitudes toward organic foods had a positive impact on consumer purchase intentions; and in relation to low-price scenarios, consumers required more confidence to purchase higher-priced goods, meaning that the relational embeddedness in a channel exerted more influence on purchase intentions. By contrast, compared to the high-price scenarios, consumers tended to choose lower priced goods based on personal preferences, e.g., making the purchase decision based on trust in the organic label and attitudes toward organic food. Originality/value - The contributions of this study include the following: the relationships among the variables were investigated comprehensively from multiple theoretical perspectives; and the results can help the government and the organic food industry to understand their respective responsibilities in promoting organic food to reduce the waste of resources, in which the government can provide basic information on organic food, e.g., a certification mechanism and related definitions, while the organic food industry provides specific knowledge about organic foods, e.g., product features.","[Liang, Rong-Da] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hospitality & Tourism, Dept Leisure & Recreat Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality & Tourism,"Liang, RD (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Hospitality & Tourism, Dept Leisure & Recreat Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",austra@ms53.url.com.tw,"Liang, Austin Rong-Da/AAE-9701-2021; Liang, Austin Rong-Da/AAI-8886-2020","Liang, Austin Rong-Da/0000-0002-9483-8503;","Agriculture and Food Agency; Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan; Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)","Agriculture and Food Agency; Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan; Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The author acknowledges the financial support of Agriculture and Food Agency, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan and Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) and the editing service of Paul Steed and Julia Zhang.",,65,90,95,10,140,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

After screening, this paper has collected the data of 2136 migrant children (including 1234 boys and 902 girls, accounting for 57.8% and 42.2% respectively), with spss20.0 software used for statistical analysis. Results: (1) The difference in BMI and body fat ratio between different genders and ages of children is statistically significant (P < 0.001), the BMI and body fat ratio of boys are higher than those of girls; among children of 7-12 years old, along with the growth of the age, BMI and body fat rate increased gradually. (2) The difference in using the approaches of BMI and body fat ratio to measure overweight and obese migrant children is of statistical significance (P <0.05), and among the migrant children, boys of all ages have a higher percentage than girls with the overweight and obesity problem. (3)Regarding gender (X1), age (X2), BMI (X3) as the independent variables, and body fat ratio (Y) as the dependent variable, a regression equation is obtained after multiple linear regression analysis as follows:This paper has concluded that the body fat ratio of urban migrant children is positively correlated with BMI: the higher BMI, the higher body fat ratio.","[Liu, Qingsong] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Phys Educ, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China",Henan University of Science & Technology,"Liu, QS (通讯作者)，Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Phys Educ, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,8,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,56.0,,,,,,190,196,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644000032,0

Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected by observations during inspections carried out in 100 randomly selected food retail stores, both independent and chain, selling fresh fish, fish products and other seafood. Stores were located in and around the area of Warsaw, Poland. The inspection check list consisted of 43 questions based on rigorist requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) 852, 853 and Codex Alimentarius. The question form was divided into three hygiene sectors: hygiene conditions of seafood departments; hygiene of fish selling process; personal hygiene of employees. Inspections were unannounced, and were conducted by discreet visual observations of employees work routine and selling procedures. Findings - The level of hygiene compliances with inspection criteria was unexpectedly low. The highest percentage of compliance appeared in the hygiene of fish selling processes (in 44 percent of the stores compliance with evaluated criteria was found), less one compliance levels appeared in personal hygiene (18 percent) and hygiene of seafood department's hygiene conditions (23 percent). Neither the size of the store, nor its location and type (independent and local or global chain) affected the compliance rate. Research limitations/implications - The main research limitation is that assessment was done only by observation method. This is one of audit/inspection methods according to ISO 19011/2011, guidelines for auditing management systems. However, this kind of inspection cannot assess microbiological cleanliness or other like ATP or symptoms of diseases expect of only visible signs. The used inspection check list needs more testing and more analyses should be done for its reliability and validity. Practical implications - Adequate hygiene practices are critical in preventing cross-contamination. However, none of the inspected stores ensured full implementation of all hygiene requirements during the sale of fish. The results indicated that a greater effort should be made to increase hygiene level both in small and large size retail stores. The designed inspection questionnaire proved to be a successful format for detailed evaluation of hygiene practices during the sale of fish. However, more work and analyses should be done for its reliability and validity. Social implications - The findings bring some information for the consumers that in many retail stores the hygiene level during the fish sales might be insufficient. Originality/value - The paper presents additional and detailed data on hygiene practices during fish selling, which are rarely pointed out by other authors. The applied evaluation method showed a low level of compliance with the rigorous hygienic criteria, adopted in this study, that may raise some food safety concerns.","[Trafialek, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Food Gastron & Food Hyg, Warsaw, Poland; [Zwolinski, Michal] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Human Nutr & Consumer Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Kolanowski, Wojciech] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Dept Dietet & Assessment Food, Siedlce, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Kolanowski, W (通讯作者)，Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Dept Dietet & Assessment Food, Siedlce, Poland.",wojciech.kolanowski@uph.edu.pl,"Trafiałek, Joanna/K-4411-2019; KOLANOWSKI, Wojciech/GWB-9902-2022; Kolanowski, Wojciech/O-6305-2019","Trafiałek, Joanna/0000-0001-5839-1786; Kolanowski, Wojciech/0000-0002-9512-123X",,,,,35,11,11,4,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study included 270 employees of six catering companies that cater to hospitals in Ankara who agreed to participate in the study. Two-part questionnaires were used. The first part solicited demographic information, and the second part's questions determined the workers' personal hygiene knowledge. Samples taken from the participants to determine the presence of Enterobius vermicularis were collected using the cellophane application method. Findings - The parasite was found in 78.1 percent of the personnel. The average hygiene knowledge scores were 58,94+18.1 on a 100-point scale. The changes introduced by the new Food Hygiene Regulation should be implemented without abolishing the food handler (FH) examination. Originality/value - Food safety is an important issue that can affect lots of people. FHs are an important part for contamination of food.

Design/methodology/approach - In the study survey, 401 participants who had purchased RTD coffee beverages within the previous month were included. Structural equation modelling was employed to analyse the survey data. Findings - The findings indicate that consumers of RTD coffee beverages form utilitarian and hedonic value perceptions through content sensory, packaging and branding, and content functional attribute beliefs. Furthermore, utilitarian value is one of the most crucial determinants of repurchase intentions. The findings further reveal that whereas content functional attribute beliefs have a dominant influence on utilitarian value, content sensory attribute beliefs have a greater influence on hedonic value. Originality/value - The findings of this study can serve as a reference for RTD coffee beverage companies to develop new products and communication strategies.","[Wang, Edward S-T.; Yu, Jia-Rong] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Wang, EST (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Taichung, Taiwan.",shihtse.wang@msa.hinet.net,"Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/E-5684-2015; Wang, Edward/JTU-8458-2023","Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/0000-0003-1302-9745;",,,,,103,43,44,12,94,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We argue that the radio industry also sheds important light on evolving production technology and determinants of competitive success in inter-war manufacturing. Timothy F. Bresnahan and Daniel M.G. Raff (1991) showed that productivity differences resulting from scale in the auto industry translated into differences in exit rates during the Depression. We find that technical scale economies did not play a large role in the radio industry. Instead selection during the Depression was on non-technical productivity factors, including whether or not a plant's parent company owned a brand.","[Scott, Peter] Univ Reading, Int Business & Strategy, Int Business Hist, Reading, Berks, England; [Ziebarth, Nicolas] Univ Iowa, Econ, Iowa City, IA 52245 USA",University of Reading; University of Iowa,"Scott, P (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Int Business & Strategy, Int Business Hist, Reading, Berks, England.",p.m.scott@reading.ac.uk; nicolas-ziebarth@uiowa.edu,,"Ziebarth, Nicolas/0000-0002-2493-791X; Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040",Economic History Society; Universities of Iowa,Economic History Society; Universities of Iowa,"We thank the Hagley Museum Library, Library of Congress, Smithsonian National Museum of American History, and Lemelson Center Archives for generous assistance with our research.

However, neoclassical economists often highlight positive aspects of competition, e.g. increased efficiency and innovation. Competition for land occurs when several agents demand the same good or service produced from a limited area. It implies that when one agent acquires scarce resources from land, less resource is available for competing agents. The resource competed for is often not land but rather its function for biomass production, which may be supplanted by other inputs that raise yields. Increased competition may stimulate efficiency but negative environmental effects are likely in the absence of appropriate regulations. Competition between affluent countries with poor people in subsistence economies likely results in adverse social and development outcomes if not mitigated through effective policies. The socioecological metabolism approach is a framework to analyze land-related limits and functions in particular with respect to production and consumption of biomass and carbon sequestration. It can generate databases that consistently link land used with biomass flows which are useful in understanding interlinkages between different products and services and thereby help to analyze systemic feedbacks in the global land system.

Results confirmed the importance and strong contribution of the tested ecological attributes. In-sample simulation indicates that current fishing efforts and harvest rates are sustainable, but are sensitive to changes in nutrient influx and rainfall. This confirms the need to modify conventional fisheries models to include environmental variables as additional predictors of fish stocks in addition to historical catch records and catch effort for management and control of fishing efforts and permits. This study provided confirmation of the strong linkage between nutrient levels and productivity of coastal fisheries thus enabling investigation of runoff and rainfall related climate change effects on the KZN fisheries.

Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis, we show that the CER credit prices are likely to have had a greater influence than regional levels of economic development on the sectors, regions and sizes of CDM projects. There are comparatively few CDM projects in Sub-Saharan Africa (less South Africa) and the small-scale forestation projects that are characteristic for the region mainly entered the CDM pipeline when CER credit price levels were high. Latin America hosts a larger number of projects, and the small-scale methane, biofuel and hydro projects that are typical for this region generally also applied for validation under high CER price levels. The large industrial gas and energy efficiency projects typical for the Middle East/Northern Africa region appear to have been largely insensitive to CER price levels. The large number and variety of projects in Asia have applied for registration under a broad range of CER price levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The urban socio-ecological regime of the industrial era has three major characteristics: i) the near-total externalisation of a more intensive urban metabolism, associated with the breakup of supply areas and the deepening, urban footprint on the environment; ii) the importance of infrastructure to this metabolism, which fits into a process of generalised networking led by engineers and leads to urban technical inter-dependencies; and iii) the urbanisation of landscapes associated with the proliferation of extra-territorial urban influences, despite the loss of certain skills available to the French capital.

This paper assesses the benefits for a set of policies designed to address tourist congestion, the increase in the welfare of the local populations, and the improvements in the ecosystem services (coral reefs, mangroves, dry forests, and coastal and sandy ecosystems). We utilize a discrete choice experiment approach with the consideration of potential heterogeneity. Results show that there are three segments of visitors with different preferences for the proposed policies. Those tourists with higher values for the environmental policies and welfare of the local communities also share a preference for a lower level of congestion at the natural areas. The results have implications for managing natural areas at tourist destinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results are compared with those obtained from the Rosen-Roback approach. We demonstrate that the traditional approach gives too much weight to the wage differential if search frictions are significant. Furthermore, the paper confirms that the wage curve is negatively sloped for quasi-linear utility. Specifically, the wage rate increases and the unemployment rate decreases in response to an increase in the amenity level if the amenity is marginally more beneficial to producers than to consumers.","[Wrede, Matthias] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany; [Wrede, Matthias] CESifo, Dresden, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Ifo Institut,"Wrede, M (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, POB 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany.",matthias.wrede@fau.de,,"Wrede, Matthias/0000-0001-8376-517X",,,,,38,3,4,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, the impact of negative externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions on the productivity of urban water provision has received less attention in the literature. This paper applies the global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) productivity index, which accounts for undesirable outputs in order to evaluate the productivity trends in the Australian urban water sector. Results indicate that the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions significantly influences the productivity measurement. Findings also indicate that the conventional index, which disregard undesirable outputs, over-states the productivity growth. Despite a declining trend in greenhouse emissions over the period, the overall productivity trend of the urban water sector experienced a downward trend while accounting for bad output This productivity decline occurs in a period of prolonged drought, water security concerns and increased reliance on desalinization and water recycling.

We develop a bioeconomic model of the exploitation of a renewable resource that can exist in multiple states. We then use this to consider the value of adaptive over non-adaptive policies when there is a change in state, and there are fixed costs of starting or stopping extraction. We take adaptive policies to be those that base extraction on the current state of the system, and the conditioning effect that has on the expected future state of the system. We take non-adaptive policies to be those that base extraction on the long run average state of the system. We find that whether adaptive or non-adaptive policies dominate depends on the fixed costs of starting or stopping extraction. If the fixed costs of closure are very low, non-adaptive policies dominate. However, if the fixed costs of closure are high, adaptive policies are preferred. We use a numerical example based on the Peruvian anchoveta fishery to illustrate the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,Wine as a unique and valuable resource An exploratory study of wine consumers on La Palma Island,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wine; Preferences; Wine consumers; La Palma Island; Resource-based view of the firm,TOURISM; AUTHENTICITY; TERROIR; BRANDS; VIEW; WEB,"Purpose - With a wine history that dates as far as the fifteenth century, and includes exports of highly valued wine products, the Canary Islands illustrates the case of a region with a splendorous wine trading past. While the potential of the uniqueness of local wines still exists, little is known about consumer patterns, and perceptions of Canary Islands wines among the local consumers. The purpose of this paper is to address this area of research, focusing on the case of La Palma Island. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire was designed to investigate both local and outside consumers. A total of 378 respondents, predominantly local residents, participated in the study. Findings - The potential of the local wines to become a valuable resource is identified in various ways. In particular, many respondent comments highlight the uniqueness of some of the local wines, including the Albillo, Malvasia, and vino de tea. In comparing various respondent groups to their wine perceptions and experiences with local wines, the findings also identify strengths, and areas of improvement, not only for those involved in wine production, but also for the island's wine tourism. Practical implications - The potential for the local designation of origin to maximise the uniqueness, historic value, and other valuable elements of the wines is highlighted. In addition, given the importance of tourism in this and other islands, opportunities exist for the local wines to be a highlight in visitors' and local residents' leisure pursuits, particularly through the organisation of special events, winery visitations, and the establishment of wine trails. Originality/value - This exploratory research on La Palma Island's consumers seeks to address a knowledge gap about a region where, albeit a very rich wine history, wine consumer research has been very limited.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business, Joondalup, WA, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business, Joondalup, WA, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,"Duarte Alonso, Abel/0000-0001-6742-7373",,,,,53,8,8,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Results are derived from primary data collected from a consumer sample in Greece. Respondents rate their brand authenticity and brand attachment for two well established authentic Greek brands in the food industry. Findings - The study confirms that brand authenticity predicts the brand attachment, while brand attachment influences consumers purchase intentions, willingness to pay more and promote the brand. Practical implications - The benefits of brand authenticity should not be ignored and should be protected by the brand managers of food brands because it can be the one of the competitive advantages that can be leveraged in the competitive food industry sector. Originality/value - It provides the required empirical support for the impact of brand authenticity on brand attachment and behavioural intentions in the food industry.","[Assiouras, Ioannis] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France; [Liapati, Georgia] Univ Toulouse, Dept Mkt, Toulouse, France; [Kouletsis, Georgios; Koniordos, Michalis] Technol Inst Piraeus, Dept Business Adm, Athens, Greece",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; Universite de Toulouse; University of West Attica,"Assiouras, I (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France.",i.assiouras@esc-toulouse.fr,"Assiouras, Ioannis/AGF-4945-2022",,,,,,88,35,42,4,81,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A non-probabilistic consumer sample (n = 630) was interviewed in the city of Campinas, Brazil. Besides the frequency of eating in full-service restaurants and the frequency of eating salads (as a function of the meal type and week day) in this type of restaurant, the survey instrument was also composed by socio-demographic variables and a social desirability scale. To compare data, non-parametric tests were used. Findings - Of the interviewees, 52.3 percent were shown to eat in full-service restaurants at least once a week. The frequency of eating salads in full-service restaurant stood out as being significantly higher (p < 0.05) for weekday lunches. Individuals who graduated in the areas of health or food showed a significantly higher frequency for the consumption of salads at weekends. Apparently the social desirability did not influence the responses of the consumers with respect to the frequencies studied. Research limitations/implications - The sample was of a non-probabilistic type, bringing reservations with respect to generalizations. Practical implications - Socio-demographic variables should be considered in elaborating strategies for promoting vegetable salads consumption in restaurants. Health and nutrition education programs can be effective in aiding consumers to choose healthier food in this context. Originality/value - Studies about frequency of salad consumption in restaurants are scarce. The influence of social desirability bias on reported frequency was analyzed in this paper.","[Danelon, Mariana Schievano; Salay, Elisabete] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Food & Nutr, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Danelon, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Food & Nutr, Campinas, Brazil.",mariana.danelon@ig.com.br,,,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq/Brazil [Process 143493/2008-6],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq/Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors are grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq/Brazil (Process 143493/2008-6) for providing a fellowship to the first author, and to the company EasyStat for carrying out the statistical analyses.",,49,1,1,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although theoretically well founded, QLH empirical evidence is far from conclusive which represents one motive for this research. Additionally, better understanding of bank market power and efficiency relationship could result in social benefit as bank output is input for other sectors in economy. By testing out the QLH we extend the empirical work done so far on bank competition in Croatia on the sample of commercial banks (1994-2014). In the first step we use the Distribution free approach for the calculation of Competition efficiency frontier and X-efficiency. In the next step, we model bank efficiency with market power and the set of control variables. Negative relationship between market power and bank efficiency, which would prove QLH, is examined also for a sub-sample of banks and historical periods in Croatian banking sector. Although we provide empirical evidence generally supporting the QLH in Croatia, the connection between market power and bank efficiency is economically rather small. However, we believe that bank competition policy should definitely include Quietlife considerations.","[Huljak, Ivan] Croatian Natl Bank, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Huljak, I (通讯作者)，Croatian Natl Bank, Zagreb, Croatia.",ivan.huljak@hnb.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS [9402],Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS,This work has been partly supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS (project no. 9402).

Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage procedure is applied in this paper. First, a non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique is applied to investigate the degree of technical efficiency for Chinese table grape wholesalers. Second, Tobit regression is used to analyze the factors influencing technical efficiency. Findings - Research results reveal that the mean technical efficiency of the sample is 0.544 and 0.860 under constant returns scale (CRS) and VRS assumptions, respectively, and the scale efficiency (SE) is 0.620. The variables of experiences, number of grape varieties on sale, daily selling volumes and fixed sale ratio have a significant effect on technical efficiency, while the other exogenous variables do not affect the efficiency in any significant way. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this research are specific to table grape wholesalers in China, however, the method used in this study is transferrable and applicable to the study of similar problems in others countries. Originality/value - This research has yielded some interesting and original insights into the efficiency level of Chinese grape wholesalers and the factors that influence the level of efficiency.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 301 hotel guests staying at 26 hotels located in Malopolskie Voivodeship were surveyed. The research study also evaluated customer opinions of hotel restaurants and specific customer suggestions in the area of service quality. The survey participants were asked to rate the hotel in which they had actually stayed and its accompanying restaurant. Findings - Research has shown that 96 percent of hotel guests took advantage of hotel restaurant services while staying at their hotel. Breakfast was the most common service rendered by each studied hotel restaurant (90 percent). In addition, 44 percent of survey participants said that their choice of hotel is in part driven by the quality of restaurant services. The two key factors for hotel restaurant patrons are food quality and courteous service. Research limitations/implications - These type of data are very valuable to the hotel industry, as the number of hotel restaurant studies is limited. Practical implications - An understanding of customer expectations with respect to hotel restaurants, which are today perceived as integral parts of the total hotel experience, is useful in terms of developing the total offering for each given hotel in order to build competitive advantage. Social implications - Such research also has implications for hospitality and tourism in that it relates to the understanding of host-guest relationships. Originality/value - A review of the research literature suggests that hotel restaurants are not studied very often and shows the lack of research papers in this area.","[Kapera, Izabela] Univ Phys Educ Krakow, Fac Tourism & Leisure, Krakow, Poland",,"Kapera, I (通讯作者)，Univ Phys Educ Krakow, Fac Tourism & Leisure, Krakow, Poland.",lowczowska@poczta.onet.pl,"Kapera, Izabela/V-9149-2018","Kapera, Izabela/0000-0003-1691-5275",,,,,24,5,6,3,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The most visited restaurants by cuisine type are pizza, fast food and Italian. However, the most legitimate (both expressed and actualised) cuisines are Korean, African, fine dining and French. Several dissonances were found between stated likes and actual consumer behaviour. The results suggest that although fast food bears a stigma as socially unacceptable cuisine, it is, nonetheless, very frequently eaten in the restaurants.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 410 samples, including fresh and frozen meats of turkey, quail, chicken, ostrich, cattle, sheep and camel, fresh chicken liver and fresh minced meat were gathered and then analyzed according to USDA-FSIS method. To enumerate L. monocytogenes, the MPN procedure was used and also, strains were serotyped by using commercial specific antisera. Findings - It was found that 28.05 percent of samples were positive for L. monocytogenes and the contamination of beef meat was higher than the others. The range of microbial load was from < 2 to 940 MPN g(-1). Most of the samples (94.39 percent) had a microbial load of < 100 MPN g(-1). Moreover, 56 percent of the strains belonged to serogroup 1, especially to 1/2a, although, the most frequently isolated serotype was serotype 4b (38.3 percent) in all samples.

Scale purification included exploratory factor analysis to derive an initial factor structure and reliability assessment and confirmatory factor analysis to test the theoretical factor structure and assess validity. Findings - The scale development procedure yielded five dimensions of destination food image: food safety and quality, attractiveness of food, health benefits of food, food culture, and unique culinary arts. Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the food-related tourism literature by measuring destination food image based on scale development processes using both cognitive and affective elements. Practical implications - The results help practitioners understand the complex dimensions of destination food image and how destination marketing professionals can use this image to advertise a destination.

The evidence strikingly confirms that by his strategy, Philip II was able to remove the de facto ceiling on the domestic debt (juros) imposed by the fixed revenue commitment of the Castilian cities in the Cortes.

Although some research regards PT in Europe as a 'common' form of arbitrage, there are reasons to believe that it is a type of 'regulatory arbitrage' that does not necessarily produce equivalent welfare effects. We draw upon a unique dataset that contains source country records of parallel imported medicine sales to the Netherlands for one therapeutic group (statins), that accounts for 5 % of the market at the time of study and it faced no generic competition. We estimate precise differences in prices and statutory distribution margins for each source country/product and, examine whether they drive parallel import flows using a gravity specification and an instrumental variable strategy. Our findings reveal that parallel imports are driven by cross-country differences in statutory distribution margins in addition to price differences, consistently with the hypothesis of PT being a type of 'regulatory arbitrage'.","[Costa-Font, Joan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",,,,,22,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

In some cases, the wait time for a consultation may be very long, which can jeopardize the patient's rehabilitation and sometimes even cause complications that lead to a loss of autonomy. In Quebec, there is a severe shortage of healthcare professionals-and of orthopedic surgeons, in particular-specializing in musculoskeletal problems. To address this problem, public managers have decided to establish interdisciplinary musculoskeletal clinics in regions outside the two major cities of Montr,al and Qu,bec. The major benefits of these clinics are that they reduce the wait time for consultation and treatment while maintaining service quality. Although their benefits are certain, these clinics remain threatened by relatively high initial costs. This study's objective is to evaluate whether the population of Quebec has a quantifiable willingness to pay (WTP) to establish these clinics. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind either in the province of Quebec or elsewhere. We selected 3822 subjects randomly within the target population using Internet surveys, telephone surveys and self-administered paper surveys as our methods of recruitment. Three payment vehicles were used and each participant was randomly allocated among these: tax, donation or lump-sum fee. A contingent valuation question using a referendum format with the option don't know was used. Econometric estimates were performed using probit and Wang's models. Our results indicate that the population of Quebec may potentially have a mean WTP of 42.3 Canadian dollars per person for such clinics, which would enable a mean reduction from 12 to 4 months of wait time. However, the WTP is found to be very sensitive to the survey mode and the payment vehicle used: about 1.2-2 times more important in the tax and the lump-sum fee scenarios than in the donation scenario, and about 3-4 times less important in the Internet survey than in the telephone or self-administered paper surveys. In addition, this amount was strongly affected by the introduction of a new governmental health-related policy that arose during the survey and led to a minimal drop in WTP of about 30-50 %. This strong sensitivity led us to the three following recommendations for future contingent valuation studies: (1) favour Internet surveys, (2) use a payment vehicle that limit uncertainty in the WTP answer and allow to socialize benefits, as the tax scenario in our study, and (3) strictly apply the divide by 2 rule of the NOAA panel.","[Poder, Thomas G.] CIUSSS Estrie CHUS, UETMIS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Poder, Thomas G.] CIUSSS Estrie CHUS, CRCHUS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [He, Jie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [He, Jie] Univ Sherbrooke, GREDI, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",University of Sherbrooke; University of Sherbrooke,"Poder, TG (通讯作者)，CIUSSS Estrie CHUS, UETMIS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.;Poder, TG (通讯作者)，CIUSSS Estrie CHUS, CRCHUS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",tpoder.chus@ssss.gouv.qc.ca; jie.he@usherbrooke.ca,,,FRQS,FRQS(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS)),"We acknowledge Renald Lemieux, Christian Bellemare and Suzanne K.

In addition to its environmental benefits, recycling is also an effective way to fundraise. Although recycling is commonplace in many countries, it is still relatively rare in Turkey. In this study, the attitudes and behaviors of housewives toward recycling were investigated using Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the proposed Structural Equation Model (SEM). It was found that the Housewives' Recycling Model (HRM), obtained as a result of the analysis, could be employed to explain their recycling behavior. In particular, the research established that the positive ideas housewives have in terms of their perceived behavioral control and the individuals in their immediate social surroundings, whose opinions they value, have a positive impact on guiding their recycling behavior.

From an econometric point of view, this might be attributed to an inaccurate control of unobserved bank heterogeneity that can bias parameter estimation severely. In this paper, we adequately control for unobserved heterogeneity through a finite mixture, random parameters logistic model, and we estimate the probability for a bank to be a bidder in an M&A depending on its ex-ante efficiency, therefore avoiding any parametric assumption on the distribution of the random effect. This leads to a likelihood function defined as the integral of the kernel density with respect to the mixing density, which has no analytical solution. For this reason, we approximate the integral with a finite sum of kernel densities, each one characterized by a different set of model parameters. We then obtain a set of non-overlapping clusters with matching values of ex-ante efficiency, and assign each bank to a cluster based on the estimated posterior probability of it being in that cluster. Moreover, in our analysis we use two different sets of measures of bank efficiency, obtained using parametric as well as semi-parametric techniques. Our results are based on a sample of 612 banks, from 34 countries, between 1991 and 2006. They show that, considering unobserved heterogeneity, cost efficiency has a major impact on the probability for a bank to bid in a cross-border M&A, but no effect in the case of domestic M&A.","[Caiazza, Stefano; Trovato, Giovanni] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, RM, Italy; [Pozzolo, Alberto Franco] Univ Molise, Campobasso, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Molise,"Trovato, G (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, RM, Italy.",giovanni.trovato@uniroma2.com,,,,,,,74,3,5,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Material flow accounting (MFA) is a method to monitor natural resource use by countries and has been widely used in research and policy. However, the increasing globalization requires the consideration of 'embodied' material use of traded products. The indicator raw material consumption (RMC) represents the material use - no matter where in the world it occurs - associated with domestic final demand. It provides a consumption-based perspective complementary to the MFA indicators that have a territorial focus. Several studies on RMC have been presented recently but with diverging results; hence, a better understanding of the underlying differences is needed. This article presents a comparison of Austrian RMC for the year 2007 calculated by six different approaches (3 multi-regional input-output (MRIO) and 3 hybrid life-cycle analysis-IO approaches). Five approaches result in an RMC higher than the domestic material consumption (DMC). One hybrid LCA-IO approach calculates RMC to be lower than DMC. For specific material categories, results diverge by 50% or more. Due to the policy relevance of the RMC and DMC indicators it is paramount that their robustness is enhanced, which needs both data and method harmonization.

During this period, the government increased public spending and made school attendance free and mandatory until the age of 13. The empirical analysis presented here suggests that greater public spending had no substantial effect on the enrolment in Catholic schools. By contrast, mandatory schooling laws had a negative, but quantitatively limited, impact. The overall resilience of Catholic schooling is traced to the political divide created by the 1789 French Revolution.","[Franck, Raphael] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Johnson, Noel D.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Bar Ilan University; George Mason University,"Franck, R (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",,,"Franck, Raphael/0000-0003-2068-0958",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union under REA grant [PIOF-GA-2012-327760],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union under REA grant(European Union (EU)),"We thank Jaime Reis (the editor), three anonymous referees, Cihan Artunc, Guillaume Daudin, Dror Goldberg, Erich Gundlach, Mark Koyama, Sriniketh Nagavarapu, and Philippe Simonnot; seminar participants at Bar-Ilan University, Paris-1 Sorbonne, and Paris-9 Dauphine; and conference participants at ASREC and EPCS for helpful comments.

We run a standard one-shot public goods experiment and two time preferences experiments with fishermen from Tasajera. It is a small fishing community located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, which depends mainly on the fishery resources of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta for its livelihood. To investigate the external validity of the experiments, we related the fishermen's individual decisions in the experiments to some indices measuring the ecological impact of fishing activities among the same group of fishermen. We found that fishermen's contributions to the public good and their levels of impatience are not robustly correlated to their real fishing behavior. We argue that the link between fishermen's behavior in the field experiments and real life could be associated to various factors, such as the specific context in which fishermen live, and the way in which cooperation in real life is measured.

We find that freedom of choice restricts sufficiency to rather wealthy societies and that a sufficiency threshold cannot be derived by referring to the poor. Sufficiency can be in conflict with the demands of social justice, i.e. if the sufficiency threshold is below the social minimum implied by social justice. Benefits from sufficiency are highly related to individual perceptions. Such benefits cannot be expressed in a standard preference framework. Consequently, alternative measures of welfare and inequality are required if sufficiency is a significant phenomenon in society. 'Standard' environmental policies can have a pronounced interaction with voluntary sufficiency, i.e. if 'quantity regulation' is present. Overall, the voluntary notion of sufficiency causes a dilemma as sufficiency is largely a matter of civil society. However, voluntary sufficiency is expected to make important contributions to the preservation of ecological resources if properly balanced with social and environmental policies and framed by public discursive control.

Using American Community Survey data, unobserved heterogeneous income damages are framed as treatment, with the moving decision being the treatment decision. An endogenous switching regression addresses self-selection issues.

Unlike some of the existing simulation studies that have considered concave frontiers, we find that both functional forms provide a reliable approximation when a true frontier is convex. Our results lend support to existing intuitive explanations concerning the translog form's innate propensity to yield convex, rather than concave, frontier estimates, suggesting that it should fare relatively well when modeling input isoquants.

As healthy dietary information has been released to the public in order to correspond with active public adaptation, more consumers have become aware of and are showing interest in new information related to health. The purpose of this paper is to utilize food-related lifestyle (FRL) instruments to explain nutrition information-conscious behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - This study used a cross-sectional survey design. A questionnaire was developed based on previous studies. A factor analysis and a cluster analysis were conducted to segment nutrition information-conscious behaviors of consumers. Participants were 200 and the survey was administered to citizens in South Korea. Exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis, analysis of variance, Duncan's multiple comparison tests, and chi(2) test were used. Findings - Nine factors were identified and four clusters were established. These clusters were named: personal value concern group, enthusiastic group, moderation group, and unconcerned group. Each segment was significantly different in body satisfaction and nutrition information-conscious behaviors. Nutrients such as dietary fibers, sodium, and trans fat were considered differently by the four segments. Originality/value - Using an FRL instrument in relation to nutrition information-conscious behavior, interesting conclusions were drawn. Results of this study suggested that each segment has its characteristics in relation to nutrition information-conscious behaviors.

Additionally, nutritional information's effectiveness is mostly unknown in the fast-food market. The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the effectiveness of various forms of nutritional labelling methods and information by analysing the consumer decision-making process of 248 fast-food consumers. Design/methodology/approach - Three discrete choice experiments are used to compare three popular nutritional symbol methods. Consumer preferences for these symbols are extracted using a choice-based conjoint analysis, while controlling for price and branding of fast-food products. Findings - It is found that a very simple traffic light signal is the best signal for suggesting healthiness, with as much as 41 per cent of the importance in consumer decision making (p<0.01), over that of product pricing and even product brand and performs better than more information laden guided daily amounts symbols and health endorsement methods (attributing 27 and 13 per cent in their respective studies). This highlights the fine balance between too much and too little food nutrition information and (most notably) how specific nutritional information methods can be even more influential on food choices than a change in product price might. Originality/value - There is currently a lack of research into the use of nutritional cues on influencing fast-food choices. Additionally, most previous studies focus on the isolated effect of nutrition labels.","[Montandon, Andrew Charles; Colli, Christopher] Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Montandon, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, Cape Town, South Africa.",mntand013@myuct.ac.za,"Montandon, Andrew/HNS-4044-2023","Montandon, Andrew/0000-0002-1583-8338",,,,,77,6,6,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main objective of macroprudential policy is to assess and mitigate potential systemic risks, ensuring a stronger resilience of the European financial system as a whole. As macroprudential measures carried out in individual EU countries may generate cross-border side-effects, accounting for spillovers is essential for assessing Member States' cross-border risk exposures. In the current challenging economic environment, banking sectors in the EU countries are weak and present a high level of vulnerability. In this sense, assessing potential risks that are easily transferable from one Member State to another is crucial for the stability of the financial system in Europe. The paper presents a cross-country analysis identifying the potential for spillovers from macroprudential policies. The main objectives of our research are twofold: (i) to present the risk-sharing framework for foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries in the EU countries and (ii) to assess the cross-border interbank and non-financial sector lending behaviour in the Euro Area countries towards non-EA Member States and other EA countries.","[Paraschiv, Anca-Mihaela; Horobet, Alexandra] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Econ & Int Affairs, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paraschiv, AM; Horobet, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Econ & Int Affairs, Bucharest, Romania.",ancamihaela.paraschiv@gmail.com; alexandra.horobet@rei.ase.ro,"Horobet, Alexandra/D-2301-2010","Horobet, Alexandra/0000-0001-5821-0244",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-267-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,57,64,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8MB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392431400006,0

This article analyses factors behind the emerging female majority in secondary schooling in early twentieth century Finland through resource allocation within households. We argue that a significant part of the female educational advantage can be explained with a classic unitary Beckerian schooling investment model. We apply an Engel specification widely used in development economics to a household budget dataset from the 1920s to estimate the effect of the age and gender of children on schooling investment across social groups. We find a pro-girl bias among households of low socio-economic status, explained primarily by the sizable penalty to boys caused by opportunity costs and expected returns. Worker boys could generate significant income from an early age, making their education initially expensive for cash-constrained families. Contrary to previous claims, the dropout rates of boys were also higher than those of girls. Together with a propensity to leave home earlier, this lowered the expected net returns to schooling. Meanwhile, the expansion of modern services created attractive job opportunities for secondary educated girls. We find no evidence of intrahousehold bargaining. The findings resemble certain cases in development economics and the economic history of advanced countries including the USA. Rather than matching with patterns of anti-girl discrimination in many developing countries, our results highlight the prehistory of the currently emerging pattern of female educational advantage-and male disadvantage-in OECD countries.","[Saaritsa, Sakari; Kaihovaara, Antti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Econ & Social Hist, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Saaritsa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Econ & Social Hist, POB 54,Snellmaninkatu 14 A, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",sakari.saaritsa@helsinki.fi,,"Kaihovaara, Antti/0000-0002-9808-0904; Saaritsa, Sakari/0000-0003-3726-2234",Academy of Finland,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"Funding from the Academy of Finland is acknowledged.

We analyze two approaches to implementing agro-environmental measures that encourage farmers to preserve water resources. Verbal interactions between farmers and agricultural advisors, who are part of these policy programs, are analyzed drawing on Jurgen Habermas's theory of communicative action. The discourse analysis used here shows that communicative action encouraged participants to re-examine the validity of the technical, experiential, and normative knowledge that legitimized their reasons for acting. This study brings to light the fact that, in the context of a business primarily oriented towards making a profit, committing to sustainable development does not only operate in technical terms; such a commitment also requires collective validation of the effectiveness of alternative farming practices.

Focusing on a hypothetical restructuring of the industry, we use a cross-section sample of 364 German water utilities in 2006, applying Data Envelopment Analysis, to analyze the potential efficiency gains from hypothetical mergers between water utilities at the county level. A conditional efficiency framework is applied to account for the water utilities' operating environments. A conditional order-m approach is applied for the detection of potential outlying observations. Merger gains are decomposed into a technical efficiency effect, a harmony effect and a scale effect. The greatest efficiency improvement potentials turn out to result from reducing individual inefficiencies while pure merger gains are found to be low.

Since there is no natural pairing of observations between countries we estimate productivity levels rather than a Malmquist index of productivity differences, using a pooled set of all observations as reference. We decompose the productivity levels into technical efficiency, scale efficiency and country specific possibility sets (technical frontiers). Data have been collected on operating costs and patient discharges in each diagnosis related group for all hospitals in the four major Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We find that there are small differences in scale and technical efficiency between countries, but large differences in production possibilities (frontier position). The country-specific Finnish frontier is the main source of the Finnish productivity advantage. There is no statistically significant association between efficiency and status as a university or capital city hospital. The results are robust to the choice of bootstrapped data envelopment analysis or stochastic frontier analysis as frontier estimation methodology.","[Kittelsen, Sverre A.

A two-box climate model is used to simulate temperatures of the atmosphere and ocean for different rates of mitigation. Mitigation rates for BC and CO2 are characterized by respective timescales for e-folding reduction in emissions intensity of gross global product. There are respective emissions models that force the box model. Lastly there is a simple economics model, with cost of mitigation varying inversely with emission intensity. Constant mitigation timescale corresponds to mitigation at a constant annual rate, for example an e-folding timescale of 40 years corresponds to 2.5% reduction each year. Discounted present cost depends only on respective mitigation timescale and respective mitigation cost at present levels of emission intensity. Least-cost mitigation is posed as choosing respective e-folding timescales, to minimize total mitigation cost under a temperature constraint (e.g. within 2 degrees C above preindustrial). Peak warming is more sensitive to mitigation timescale for CO2 than for BC. Therefore rapid mitigation of CO2 emission intensity is essential to limiting peak warming, but simultaneous mitigation of BC can reduce total mitigation expenditure. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It makes an explicit quality adjustment of the output of the education sector by proposing and implementing a hedonic approach. The approach represents a practical approach for the quality adjustment in education output and can be applied using the existing data from statistical agencies. The measurement of education output in the paper is predicated on the notion that the output of the education sector represents investment in human capital and it has two variants. The income-based approach measures investment in education as increments in the future stream of earnings arising from education. The cost-based approach measures investment as total expenditures related to education.,"[Gu, Wulong; Wong, Ambrose] STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Gu, WL (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, 100 Tunneys Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada.",Wulong.Gu@statcan.gc.ca,,,,,,,27,8,9,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

By the late eleventh century in the Song dynasty, two-thirds of state revenues came from taxing non-agricultural sectors, especially from the collection of excise. The Song state became the first sustainable tax state in global history, as manifested in three major aspects: monetization; indirect taxation; and centralization and professionalization in the tax administration. The boundary of the Song tax state was largely confined to urban settlements. In rural areas, the state gave up the collection of commercial taxes by farming out this right to local elites. In the twelfth century, as traditional tax revenues fell far short of supporting military defence, the Song administration utilized credit instruments. Around 1200, the amount of redeemable promissory notes first exceeded that of annual tax revenues. This shift from tax-based public finance to credit-based public finance completed the transition towards a fiscal state. Nonetheless, this development in the fiscal state was still at an early stage and proved to be unstable. Toward the end of the Southern Song, hyperinflation caused by the over-issuance of promissory notes seriously threatened the economy.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Liu, WG (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"LIU, William Guanglin/0000-0002-7588-3130",,,,,94,27,31,9,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

By embedding the index within the wider economic, political, and social histories of the period, the article presents a consideration of how it came to exert such influence over the economy, and why, despite its widely acknowledged inadequacies, the index remained tied to a rough estimation of a pre-1914 pattern of working-class expenditure until 1947. Through examining the debates surrounding its compilation and the context in which decisions were taken about its modification, it is demonstrated that, far from being a neutral statistical measure, the official cost of living index was essentially political in nature.","Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Searle, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",,,"searle, rebecca/0000-0002-8080-3019",ESRC [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,60,8,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on data from a questionnaire survey and actual purchase data obtained from a practical study conducted in Japan. The data were analyzed using regression analysis. Findings - Consumers who gain economic rewards by purchasing locally produced low-input fresh food are not likely to purchase these products exclusively for the economic rewards of the program; rather, they do so to get safe and good quality food and to support local farmers and local farm conservation. The most remarkable finding is that the scheme that provides economic rewards makes such products more affordable for consumers from lower-income households. Originality/value - This study is of academic value and of value to policy makers and practitioners in the local food supply chain. The study suggests that for increasing and stabilizing the demand for environment-friendly farm products, institutions for creating, designing, and supporting a new market for potential consumers are needed, together with suitable certification systems.","Nara Womens Univ, Fac Human Life & Environm, Nara 630, Japan",Nara Womens University,"Aoki, M (通讯作者)，Nara Womens Univ, Fac Human Life & Environm, Nara 630, Japan.",aoki.misa@cc.nara-wu.ac.jp,,,,,,,50,2,3,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A number of Irish consumer studies have been carried out and most notably by An Bord Bia. Purchasing and Eating in the Republic of Ireland (PERIscope) investigates Irish consumer food preferences from 2009-2013, based on data obtained from +1,000 people in Ireland. Frequency analysis of these data sets was used to generate majority findings and preference attributes from which to propose a profile of the AIC. Component and cluster analysis was applied to investigate potential relationships between preference attributes and the significance of these relationships. Findings - The AIC is a female to whom price is a priority in food choice and prefers foods that are quick and easy to prepare. The AIC checks foods labels, looks for the low-fat option, but has difficulty understanding nutrition claims and labels. The AIC buys local produce at least monthly, believes local food has less artificial/preservative ingredients and checks for the country of origin on food products. The AIC is conscious of environmental issues and prefers to buy from companies that are environmentally friendly. The AIC buys food in smaller packs as it means less waste, is possibly more convenient and lower priced. Originality/value - It is the aim of this publication to provide a profile of the AIC to assist food companies in understanding and targeting the consumers of their products when developing packaged food products.","[Broderick, Meave; Bouchier-Hayes, Agnes; Larkin, Tracey] Limerick Inst Technol, FoodDS, Food Dev Serv, Limerick, Ireland",Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest,"Broderick, M (通讯作者)，Limerick Inst Technol, FoodDS, Food Dev Serv, Limerick, Ireland.",meave.broderick@lit.ie,,,,,,,36,4,4,4,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a web-survey of 214 food European SMEs. Binary logistic regression models were utilized for data analysis. Findings - The findings support the recent studies that suggest that the introduction of different types of innovation is associated with different types of source of knowledge. They indicate that collaboration with customers matter for product innovations in food SMEs while collaboration with competitors is more important for organizational innovations in this type of firm. In addition, collaboration with science base actors does not appear relevant to innovation in food SMEs, supporting previous works that highlight the predominant role of market base actors in innovation in this type of firm. Research limitations/implications - In line with previous research on innovation in SMEs, the generalization of the findings to all European food SMEs may be limited due to the low response rate and the difficulties in collecting innovation data from micro-firms. Data used in the study were gathered from single informants also which may have resulted in self-report bias. Besides, cross-sectional data were employed so no causal inferences could be drawn. Originality/value - Although the food industry is a major sector for the European economy, little attention has been given to the sources of knowledge that may be used for innovation in this industry. This paper offers interesting insights into the importance of external sources for innovation. Moreover, past research dealing with collaboration for innovation usually focus on product and process innovations. The paper adds to these by incorporating market and organizational innovations.","[Lefebvre, Virginie Marie; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Steur, Hans] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Div Agri Food Mkt & Chain Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Lefebvre, VM (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Virginie.Lefebvre@UGent.be,,"De Steur, Hans/0000-0003-1340-0882",European Union [245301],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 245301 NetGrow - Enhancing the innovativeness of food SMEs through the management of strategic network behaviour and network learning performance.

The subjects of discussions are compared, and selected sequences are analyzed using objective hermeneutics. Findings - Results indicate that, in Germany, agriculture is largely perceived as a black box where food safety is a crucial issue. Although food safety also is discussed in Switzerland, Swiss discussants focus more on changes that should be implemented in agricultural production and policy systems. Research limitations/implications - The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of newsrooms and message boards reveals important insights, particularly in a comparative setting.

Conflict of interest exists for business between maintaining shareholder value and delivering value within the food offering to its customers and the wider array of societal stakeholders. Shareholders are profit driven and price is the predominant factor that influences consumer purchasing behaviour leading to a constantly negotiated interface between price and other reward factors.

However, existing analyses have not comprehensively covered all the governance texts that have a bearing on transboundary groundwater resources or looked at them from the perspective of sustainable groundwater governance. Therefore, this paper responds to the questions: What are the global governance texts (including international laws) applicable to groundwater resources; to which forms of the resource do they apply; which principles have been included over time; and what are the implications for sustainable development of groundwater resources now and in the future? The analysis highlights key groundwater concepts, discusses twelve global groundwater governance texts and the thirty principles therein, classifies the principles into ideal-typical categories based on the sustainable development concept; and assesses the gaps and conflicts between the principles and texts. The paper has three key findings. First, groundwater governance is rapidly evolving and there are a number of principles available to promote sustainable development. Second, however, these collective principles do not adequately address (a) the link with all water resources; (b) the potential impact of climate change on water resources; and (c) the impact of trade on equitable sharing of groundwater and protection of groundwater-related ecosystems. Third, to the extent that this collection of principles can contribute to sustainable development, they are inconsistently included in the legally binding groundwater governance texts. Therefore, much progress is needed to ensure a global normative framework that can guide the sustainable governance of groundwater resources.","[Conti, Kirstin I.] Univ Amsterdam, AISSR, Governance & Inclus Dev, Nieuwe Actergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Conti, Kirstin I.] IGRAC, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dept Geog Planol & Int Dev Studies, Room 2-12b,Plantage Muidergracht 14, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Amsterdam,"Conti, KI (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, AISSR, Governance & Inclus Dev, Nieuwe Actergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Conti, KI (通讯作者)，IGRAC, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.",k.i.conti@uva.nl; j.gupta@uva.nl,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013","Conti, Kirstin/0000-0002-2599-8626; Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",,,,,54,15,16,2,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

These issues are prevalent within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, and the CDM has provided policy makers with a useful starting point to understanding how offset credits can be utilised within a post-Kyoto framework. The primary aim of this research is to investigate how project-based offset credits generated by states would interact within a linked framework using monetary rules and exchange rates. The examination of a linked system, specifically, was owing to the structure of the proposed agreement to be finalised in Paris at COP 21 where nationally determined contributions would be submitted by each state, allowing for the possibility of linked domestic carbon market mechanisms. The certified emission reduction credits of the CDM were used as a model to investigate the trade of offset credits within a linked system which act as a unique climate currency of each domestic offset credit mechanism. These offset credits could be earned through the implementation of domestic projects or projects hosted in other states. From this research, we conclude that fixed exchange rates are more stable than flexible exchange rates in a climate currency framework. Fixed exchange rates reduce losses of capital (owing to uncertainty in the markets) and the prominence of asymmetric spatial price transmission associated with fiat offset credit prices. To encourage co-operation between developing and developed countries, it is recommended that a combination of currency area theory and trade blocs be implemented as opposed to a currency union. Currency areas are the most viable option as they maintain that the domestic offset credit mechanism is under the control of the state and retains a level of stability as individual state offset credit prices are fixed to the same price. Even though this research forms the basis for a new climate policy architecture, the overall effectiveness of the policy will be determined by the selection of appropriate discount schemes, increased participation and agreement by states, and most significantly, political will.","[Pillay, Kamleshan] Univ Cambridge, Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England; [Vinuales, Jorge E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Pillay, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England.",pillay.kamleshan@gmail.com; jev32@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,107,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It seeks to understand the variety of ways that partnership' was used: explicit partnership, de facto' partnership, joint' activity, and asset ownership together. The article confirms that partnerships were chiefly between two people. Complexity and transaction costs largely precluded larger size and squeezed the partnership into a middle ground' between the sole proprietor and the corporation. The main size contrast was between farms with small employee numbers, and larger non-farm business partnerships. Generally differences in the gender of business owners have greater salience than sectors. Few female business partnerships employed more than four people (mean 3.4), while male partnerships ranged up to several thousand employees (mean 33.6), and 18.6 for mixed gender.While many women were involved in businesses, their opportunities remained restricted, and most were in partnership with male partners. Family structures were important, with three-quarters of all identifiable partnerships having some form of family relationship, with a strong preponderance of single women in female-only partnerships, married men in male-only partnerships, and widows in mixed gender businesses.","[Bennett, Robert J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Cambridge,"Bennett, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Grp Hist Populat & Social Struct, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",,,"Bennett, Robert/0000-0003-3940-1760",Leverhulme Trust [RG66385],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"This research was supported in part by Leverhulme Trust grant RG66385.

This paper investigates the role played by natural amenities in the formation of segregated residential patterns with respect to household size and socio-professional status. We estimate residential location choice models for large household samples in two metropolitan areas in France: Grenoble in the Alps, and Marseille on the Mediterranean coast. In a second step, we perform counterfactual segregation analysis using Monte Carlo simulations, to compare segregation outcomes with and without preferences for natural amenities. Our main result is that households' search for natural amenities has significant impacts on residential segregation. It most often contributes to strengthening segregation, but can also be a factor attenuating segregation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover. We conclude that payments for ecosystem services in the form of subsidies for agroecology practices are promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Trevisan, A. C.

Improved insight into the economic benefits derived from preservation could be achieved through a better understanding of the underlying economics. In response to this challenge, a growing number of studies estimate the economic value of heritage sites. The purpose of this study is to identify common drivers of the economic value of cultural and historical heritage by conducting a meta-analysis of heritage valuation studies. We find that heritage sites in areas with higher population density hold higher value, and conservation that supports adaptive re-use of sites generates higher values then passive protection. Valuation studies of tangible heritage dominate our dataset, but our findings are robust across model specifications. We identify a need for more economic and interdisciplinary research on the value of non-built heritage to improve understanding of the composition and drivers of heritage value.

They may bear the uncertainty and purchase the product without deliberation. Alternatively, consumers can incur a deliberation cost to find out their true valuation and then make their purchase decision. This paper proposes that consumer deliberation about product valuation can be an endogenous mechanism to enable credible quality signaling. We demonstrate this point in a simple setup in which product quality influences the probability that the product has high valuation. We show that with endogenous deliberation there may exist a unique separating equilibrium in which the high-quality firm induces consumer deliberation by setting a high price whereas the low-quality firm prevents deliberation by charging a low price. Compared to the case of complete information, the price of the high-quality firm can be distorted upward to facilitate consumer deliberation, or distorted downward to avoid the low-quality firm's imitation. In an extension we show that dissipative advertising can facilitate quality signaling. The high-quality firm can utilize advertising spending to avert imitation from the low-quality firm without distorting price downward, earning a higher profit than that without advertising. However, advertising mitigates the distortion at the expense of consumer surplus and social welfare.","[Guo, Liang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Business Sch, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yue] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Guo, L (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Business Sch, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",liangguo@baf.cuhk.edu.hk; yue.wu@katz.pitt.edu,"Wu, Yue/IUN-1925-2023",,,,,,31,10,11,6,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

BOs can be defined as facilitators who allow for interorganisational collaboration. Our paper provides a more nuanced understanding of specific BO activities and their contributions towards urban sustainability. Our analysis is based on applying three complementary methodological angles (drawing on geolocalised data, interviews and action research) to 20 years of urban renovation investments in the city-region of Brussels. We distinguish between multi-scale, multi-actor and multidimensional tensions in urban renovation programmes and link these tensions to bridging challenges for BOs. Results suggest that the corresponding three types of bridging roles form a trilemma rather than a trilogy: the BOs in study have mediated one tension by de facto exacerbating another. Lessons from action research suggest that a wider use of temporality and shared language to communicate about urban renovation projects could attenuate the bridging trilemma. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Oftentimes nature is not considered part of the cost/benefit analyses preceding such economic development, and most people find it offensive to price-tag nature. To pit (sacred) nature-values against other monetized values (these are so-called taboo trade-offs) is seen as morally offensive. Non-nature related taboo trade-offs (e.g. between life-saving and money-saving) were found elsewhere to induce moral cleansing attempts to reaffirm one's own moral position by performing overly moral 'cleansing' behaviour. This study investigated whether trade-offs between nature as sacred value and money as secular induces such moral cleansing in shape of pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). A laboratory experiment measured self-reported (hypothetical) and real donations to an environmental cause, after participants were presented with a taboo or non-taboo trade-off. Taboo trade-offs affected participants' real, but not hypothetical behaviour. Findings support prior evidence that confrontation with certain trade-offs affects people's behaviour, and expand the scope of sacred values to include nature, and moral cleansing behaviour to PEB.

This explains the interest of economic historians to observe, analyze and explain the conditions under which such growth occurred. One of the topics is the 1890 crisis, or Baring Crisis. This was seen by contemporaries as the worst economic debacle of the nineteenth century. Studies in economic history have seen this crisis both their macroeconomic aspects, and from the impact that would have occurred in the population. Also, in recent years there has been a renewed interest in the production and analysis of series of prices and wages, as key to analyzing economic indicators economy conditions and living conditions and inequality. Given this historiographical renewal, in this article a new series of prices and wages of Buenos Aires in the late nineteenth century are presented. With this new information, and open discussion with previous works, a new perspective on the evolution of prices and wages is provided, with a different perspective on the impact of the 1890 crisis.","[Vence Conti, Agustina] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Martin Cuesta, Eduardo] CEEED IIEP FCE UBA CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Martin Cuesta, Eduardo] Univ Buenos Aires, CEEED, Ave Cordoba 2122,2 Piso,1120, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Martin Cuesta, Eduardo] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Interdisciplinario Econ Polit IIEP Baires, Ave Cordoba 2122,2 Piso,1120, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires,"Conti, AV (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",agustina.vence@gmail.com; martincuesta@conicet.gov.ar,,"Cuesta, Eduardo Martin/0000-0002-2017-2278",,,,,63,1,1,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

We briefly review the history of the scope test in order to place the current issue in the context of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. As a result of the review we gain insights into how the issue of scope adequacy arose twenty years after it was first mentioned by the NOAA Panel on Contingent Valuation following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. We then provide a review of Desvousges, Mathews and Train (2012) who promote the adding-up test to identify inadequate responsiveness to scope adequacy. The adding-up test is a test of the construct validity of the contingent valuation method but is flawed as a measure of economic significance. We propose scope elasticity of willingness-to-pay as a measure of economic significance. A simulation suggests a likely range of elasticity estimates given linear and quadratic functional forms for the willingness-to-pay function. In order to illustrate the ease of implementation of scope elasticity within the context of the standard scope test we calculate scope elasticity with willingness-to-pay estimates from several studies, describe two studies that directly estimate scope elasticity and estimate scope elasticity with primary data from two studies. All of these empirical estimates of scope elasticity fall within the range of scope elasticity suggested by the simulation. Scope elasticity provides a practical way forward, relative to the adding up test, on the issue of economic significance of scope effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We propose an innovative valuation methodology in which dichotomous-choice contingent valuation is used to estimate the demand curve (price-quantity relationship) for such food items where price means price premium for the SUP output, quantity is the probability of choosing SUP and the conventional food product is kept available in the market at the current market price. This methodology can be used to evaluate market differentiation as a policy option to promote the SUP. The methodology is tested with data from a sample of urban consumers of fruits and vegetables in Portugal. The estimated demand curve is used to define the price level maximizing the total premium revenue for the SUP sector as a whole. This optimal level of the price premium is (sic)77.55 (or 163% of the value of the monthly basket of fruits and vegetables at current prices). Adopting the optimal price premium will decrease the number of consumers of SUP food by 54%. The reduction is even higher for low income consumers (80%) leaving them more exposed to the risks of pesticide use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It ignores the fact that the opportunity cost of health spending is different between poor and nonpoor households. The other two measures allow for distribution sensitivity but differ in their conceptualization of inequality; one is based on socioeconomic inequalities in catastrophic health payments, and the other uses pure inequalities in catastrophic health payments. The proposed measures are then applied to Malawian data from the Third Integrated Household Survey. The empirical results show that when the threshold of pre-payment income is increased from 5 to 15 %, the average exit time decreases from 2.1 to 0.2 years; and as the catastrophic threshold rises from 10 to 40 % of ability to pay, the average exit time falls from 3.6 to 0.1 years. It is found that adjusting for socioeconomic inequality leads to small changes in the exit times, however, using pure inequality leads to large reductions in the exit time.","[Mussa, Richard] Univ Malawi, Dept Econ, Chancellor Coll, Box 280, Zomba, Malawi",University of Malawi,"Mussa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malawi, Dept Econ, Chancellor Coll, Box 280, Zomba, Malawi.",rimussa@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

A critical appraisal,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inclusive wealth; Sustainability; Well-being; Indicators; Green accounting,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INDICATORS; GROWTH,"Among recent high-profile propositions to revise national accounts and to provide new indicators of sustainability and well-being, the inclusive wealth framework and the related inclusive wealth index (IWI) undoubtedly stand out as one of the most promising endeavours. Built up at the confluence of welfare, development and sustainability economics, the indicator has been designed to bring information about the wealth of nations and their sustain ability, in a comprehensive way. The inclusive wealth framework is nevertheless fraught with limitations, due to questionable theoretical assumptions, gaps in data availability, unrealistic assumptions about the future and inability to account for distributional issues. We propose a non-exhaustive critical appraisal of the index and its underlying framework. We conclude that these limitations undermine its capacity to fulfil the requirements of a satisfactory sustainability indicator. We argue that most problems lie in the substantial discrepancy between the inclusive ambition of the indicator and the scarce means to implement it. Whereas the interconnectedness of the various assets that constitute wealth as well as their complex evolution through time are acknowledged by the proponents of inclusive wealth, the way the IWI is computed is rather a mere addition of layers of actuarial-like monetary values for a (not inclusive yet) range of capital assets. Caution is thus warranted while using such an approach, and shorter-range alternatives to pursue similar goals are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite their high numbers, small-scale fisheries are often understudied. They are usually economically and politically marginalized, and therefore vulnerable to large-scale threats (e.g., globalized markets). To support this sector and contribute to its sustainability, we argue that it is fundamental to understand how economically viable small-scale fisheries are. Hence, the main objective of this article is to critically review and describe the current discourse on the economic viability of small-scale fisheries. We find that currently, economic viability is mainly equated with financial viability, where profitability is the goal. In consideration of socio-economic aspects, the maintenance of nonnegative net benefits to society is often not considered in current notions of economic viability. While these shortcomings have been acknowledged in some of the existing literature, our review shows that they have not yet been addressed comprehensively. We therefore conclude that it is necessary to develop or expand current methods to better take into account social aspects when assessing the economic viability of small-scale fisheries. This would help find solutions to make these fisheries less vulnerable and better equipped to face large-scale processes of change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This variable is generated using remotely sensed net primary productivity (NPP) data and available grassland area, and entitled as grassland total NPP capacity. With the one-step approach of using a multi-output, multi-input stochastic input-oriented distance function based on field survey data combined with NPP data, we estimated the technical efficiency of livestock grazing on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using two measurements related to ecological performance, an environmental performance indicator and environmental efficiency. The average technical efficiency is estimated to be 0.837 when considering grassland total NPP capacity, implying that livestock grazing inputs can be decreased by 16.3% without any reduction in outputs. The average environmental performance indicator is estimated to be 0.013, representing the effects in association with NPP per unit grassland. Environmental efficiency is about 0.123, meaning there might be overuse of grassland total NPP capacity in livestock grazing, in terms of overuse of grassland size or overuse of NPP per unit grassland. Understanding relationship between technical efficiency and ecological performance would be helpful for balancing local economic development and environmental protection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(2003) which studies the sequence of dominant sensations of a product during its consumption. TDS is believed to be more appropriate to explain consumer responses than static descriptive analysis due to its temporal element. The purpose of this paper is to define the temporal sensory profile of a new product: polenta stick. In particular, TDS method was used to measure the dominance of sensory attributes in polenta stick samples and dynamic consumer tests were performed in order to verify if the acceptability changed over time during sample consumption. Design/methodology/approach - Eight polenta sticks, different in terms of storage conditions, cooking procedures and serving temperatures, were analysed by means of TDS with 13 assessors. During two preliminary sessions, the attributes list, constituted by the nine most cited sensations, was generated. Five replications were carried out. In dynamic consumer tests, 50 subjects were asked to give their liking on a seven-category scale for the frozen samples, in different five moments during the evaluation. Findings - TDS results showed a significant effect of the experimental conditions on dominant attribute perception of polenta sticks. For the oven-cooked samples, more flavour attributes were perceived as dominant, whereas for the fried samples, the attributes crispness and oiliness overcame with a high panel dominance rate and for a long time. For the chilled samples, crispness had the highest panel dominance rate; whereas for the frozen samples, creaminess was the most dominant attribute. Consumer liking scores did not significantly change over time during consumption for all the samples. The fried samples received the highest liking scores, at both serving temperatures. Practical implications - The chosen sensory methods gave the authors important information about the real perception of the products during consumption. A lot of foodstuffs show several sensory properties that appear in different times during evaluation and/or consumption. These properties could affect overall liking so they should be taken into account. Originality/value - New dynamic sensory methods were used to characterize a new food product, i.e. polenta-based sticks. The procedure used to evaluate the liking by consumers was completely innovative, whereas the sensory method used to characterize the samples was recently developed. The new food product was developed as an aim of an Italian research project funded by MiSE (Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico) for the valorization of maize flour (MAISFOOD, Industria 2015).","[Di Monaco, Rossella; Miele, Nicoletta Antonella; Volpe, Stefania; Masi, Paolo; Cavella, Silvana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Miele, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy.",nicolettaantonella.miele@unina.it,"di monaco, rossella/A-2426-2012; Miele, Nicoletta Antonella/K-4882-2015","di monaco, rossella/0000-0003-4402-4023; Miele, Nicoletta Antonella/0000-0002-9018-408X","MiSE, MAISFOOD Industria project","MiSE, MAISFOOD Industria project","This research was supported by the MiSE, MAISFOOD Industria 2015 project.",,25,7,7,2,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Ferto, I; Molnár, A; Tóth, J",,,,"Ferto, Imre; Molnar, Adrienn; Toth, Jozsef",,,Borderless ideas - open innovation in the Hungarian food chain,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Open innovation; SMEs; Absorptive capacity; Food chain,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; SECTORAL PATTERNS; NETWORKS; PRODUCT; FIRMS; DETERMINANTS,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the innovation performance in the Hungarian food chain using the concept of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small-and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of open innovation and a company's absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their open innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Findings - Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers). Research limitations/implications - Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 - 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrargazdasagi Kutatointezet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper's limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain). Practical implications - The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain's enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of open innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems. Originality/value - The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity).","[Ferto, Imre; Molnar, Adrienn] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary; [Molnar, Adrienn] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Toth, Jozsef] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Ghent University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Molnár, A (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary.;Molnár, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.",Adrienn.Molnar@UGent.be,"Toth, Jozsef/ABI-6303-2020; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Molnar, Adrienn/AAK-2861-2020","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Molnar, Adrienn/0000-0002-3828-4198","Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) [K 84327, PD 116226]",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA, K 84327) Integration of small farms into the modern food chain, and of the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA, PD 116226) Supply chain and network performance and relationships in the agribusiness sector.",,101,10,14,2,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main objective of this article is to give a contribution into discussion on long-term challenges for fiscal sustainability and possible policy options dealing with challenges. In the first part of the article, the authors analyze the demographic development in Latvia and proposed policy options and reforms for increase of labour force participation. In the second part, age-related budget expenditure for pensions, health care, education etc. are being analyzed, here paying more attention on pension system and the impact of recent pension reform. Low social spending in Latvia reduces the sustainability risks but doesn't ensure adequate benefits for future pensioners. This challenging task for the government is being accompanied with the uncertainty about the number of taxpayers in upcoming years. The pension adequacy and the recent improvements in increase of benefits are being analyzed as well as proposals are made for further policies which might help ensuring fiscal sustainability. Sustainability of public finance is a very complicated issue with many components, thus the complex reform package is proposed including efficiency of spending, continuing reforms of pension system, tax reform together with continuing active labour market policy.","[Kekla, Julija] Minist Finance Republ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Senfelde, Maija] Riga Tech Univ, Fac Engn Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Kekla, J (通讯作者)，Minist Finance Republ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.;Senfelde, M (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Fac Engn Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia.",julija.kekla@fm.gov.lv; maija.senfelde@rtu.lv,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,3,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,274,281,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200033,0

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire with 63 questions that encompassed 11 latent factors was used to obtain information. The questionnaire was administered to 14,720 people in Mexico's urban areas. Findings - The results revealed important similarities and differences with studies in other countries, showing mainly that the respondents did not have sufficient information about GMOs, they have low level of knowledge about GMOs (31.28 percent), are highly distrustful of GMOs, perceive high risk regarding GMOs (59.13 percent), want transgenic products to be labeled (93.59 percent) and do not perceive GMOs' social values and positive health effects beyond increasing agricultural productivity. Also, it was observed that the higher the educational level of individuals, the lower the acceptance of GMOs. Research limitations/implications - The authors conclude that it is necessary to generate and provide scientifically accurate information on GMOs, so that people are better informed and can give a critical opinion on the use of GMOs. Practical implications - The major practical contribution of this research is that it provides empirical knowledge about the perceptions and attitudes toward the production and consumption of GMOs among the Mexican's urban society, which can be of great help for the Mexican government to rethink if it is an appropriate moment to completely open the doors to international companies to cultivate crops like maize and others that have been postponed due to pressure from the environmental groups, farmers and other sectors of the society. Social implications - This is especially important in the context of maize as it is part of the cultural heritage of Mexico since ancient times. However, it is not clear what the overall perception is in the Mexican society on the use of GMOs for cultivation. Originality/value - Southern regions of Mexico are the center of origin of several cultivated plants such as maize and legumes. The introduction of GMOs, called transgenics, in agriculture and food continues to cause enormous controversy in the perceptions and attitudes mainly among environmental groups and farmers in Mexico.","[Montesinos Lopez, Osval A.; Santos Fuentes, Eric Eduardo] Univ Colima, Fac Telemat, Colima, Mexico; [Franco Perez, Emeterio] Univ Colima, Fac Mkt, Colima, Mexico; [Luna-Espinoza, Ignacio] Univ Colima, Fac Accounting & Adm, Colima, Mexico; [Aragon Cuevas, Flavio] Natl Inst Forestry Agr & Livestock Res INIFAP, Reg Res Ctr South Pacific, Oaxaca, Mexico",Universidad de Colima; Universidad de Colima; Universidad de Colima,"Pérez, EF (通讯作者)，Univ Colima, Fac Mkt, Colima, Mexico.",francoperez@ucol.mx,,"Montesinos-Lopez, Osval Antonio/0000-0002-3973-6547",,,,,36,14,14,1,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The research included a literature review with a series of tests across a sequence of blind and sighted tasting experiments involving 278 subjects assessing seven differently priced products of orange juice, coffee and wine. Findings - The paper found evidence that consumption rates do affect the way consumers respond to price information and that sight-based System 1 judgement errors accrue and increase progressively with consumption. This relationship was observed to be stronger in sight-based product assessments for consumption of four or more units per week compared to those consuming one unit per week. For blind-based product assessments, an inverse relationship between price affect and consumption was observed, with affect reported to be stronger for minimal rates of consumption. Originality/value - The observation of sight-based and blind-based affect relationships which are dependent on the levels of product consumption appears to be an interesting advancement in consumer behaviour research. This provides support for a dual structure of rationality operated by an interconnection between System 1 sight-based associations and System 2 blind-based ponderous thinking.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of food in the lives of South African migrants to Australia. How food impacts on notions of identity and belonging for immigrants is framed and discussed within the context of nostalgia, sharing and Bourdieu's habitus. Design/methodology/approach - Through mixed qualitative methods, including participatory research, document analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the everyday experiences of South African-Australians. The study employs an interpretivist approach that aims for greater understanding of the subject through the perspectives of the research participants. Findings - Culinary rituals and traditions feature large in personal narratives of adjustment that reveal the important role of food in contributing to identity translation in a destination society and, ultimately, the attainment of belonging for migrants. Research limitations/implications - The study provides a snapshot of a topic that would benefit from further exploration. Practical implications - The importance for migrants to have access to cultural traditions surrounding food is acknowledged in the contemporary world where increasingly mobile populations need to maintain a sense of identity and feel a sense of belonging while integrating into host societies. Social implications - Traditional cuisines are an integral part of the mechanisms by which migrants can better integrate leading to overall greater social cohesion.

Its current unsustainable use asks for a better understanding of the main determinants of urban expansion. A heuristic approach is used to analyze urban development in Italy. In particular, the paper estimates an econometric model to test the impact of the Italian property tax (ICI) on the local authorities' behavior and, in particular, on urban planning and development It tests whether its introduction has fostered rather than dampened construction activity. The hypothesis put forward is that, because of the concurrent market conditions, the introduction of the tax has facilitated urban development The structure of the tax and the devolution process that began in the '90s induced local municipalities to adopt less tight (accommodative) urban policies to offset budgetary needs. A more elastic urban policy reduces price volatility. However, its overall welfare effect is not clearly determined. Indeed, ceteris paribus, geographical areas with more elastic housing supply witness larger land consumption. The land use changes we witnessed in the last decades could be the combined effect of financial and fiscal aspects. If this is so, careful attention should be given to the issue of whether leaving urban planning and the power to levy property taxes under the same jurisdiction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We model the requirement to hold levels of a fixed input, i.e. equity, above the long run equilibrium level or, alternatively, to achieve a target equity-asset ratio. To capture the effect of this under-leveraging, we allow the banking system to operate in an uneconomic region of the technology. Productivity decomposition is developed to include exogenous factors such as policy constraints. We use a panel data set of banks in emerging economies during the financial upheaval period of 2005-2008 to analyse these ideas.

Although methods such as joint latent class modeling can relate these measures to stated preference data, economics literature offers limited guidance on important details, including the relative merits of the two attitude types. This paper analyzes survey data about the management of the invasive, non-native fungus that causes the lethal disease white pine blister rust in high-elevation forests, a problem characterized by long time scales and potentially costly interventions of uncertain efficacy. The paper uses novel techniques for comparing across latent class model specifications to evaluate the relative contribution of general and specific attitude measures to the analysis of contingent valuation data. These demonstrate insights from investigating heterogeneity in respondents' perspectives and superior model performance with specific attitude statements versus with general attitude statements. In addition to the practical content, these results offer novel insight into ongoing debate on the meaning of stated preference valuation measures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This effect may contribute to a positive feedback whereby deforestation could degrade environmental conditions and inhibit forest reestablishment. Sudden changes in forest functioning can be attributed to the existence of multiple stable states with one high and one low vegetation state. Multiple factors govern whether a transition between states will occur following deforestation. One such factor is strategic behavior and whether communities or stakeholders with an interest in the forest cooperate to maintain the forest in the fully vegetated state by reducing extraction levels or choose their own extraction rates without considering the collective effect of this behavior. We examine how the effect of a positive feedback and strategic behavior affect the optimal quantity of vegetation, V*. A clear hysteresis exists for logged forests exhibiting a positive feedback whereby an increase in extraction rates leads to a shift to the low vegetation state. An increase in the ecological value of the forest increases V* whereas the opposite is true for an increase in the value of timber. V* is also higher under cooperative conditions than noncooperative conditions. Notably, accounting for the effect of a positive feedback substantially increases V*. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a dynamic household bio-economic model by taking into account the existing farming system, resource constraints and market imperfections. Climate-induced production risk is introduced into the model by estimating a weather-specific production function using data generated from a crop simulation model. It is found that the full package of CA, which consists of minimum tillage, mulching and crop diversification, does not appear to be in the best interest of smallholder farmers. However, loosely defined CA practises such as sole maize production with conservation tillage and maize-bean intercropping with conventional tillage, which are not currently practised in the study area, are likely to be adopted by the farmers. The results further demonstrate that time preference, risk aversion, limited credit and market access are key constraints to CA uptake. However, merely addressing these constraints may be insufficient incentives for smallholder farmers to fully adopt CA practises. It is important to identify conditions under which the full package CA can be effectively adopted before it is widely promoted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in spite of the success in most EU countries in the uptake of the programme by farmers, the impact of the scheme on the long term commitment of farmers to change their practices remains poorly documented. To explore this issue, this paper presents the results of structured field interviews and a quantitative survey in the Walloon Region of Belgium. The main finding of this study is that farmers who have periodic contacts with network bridging organisations that foster cooperation and social learning in the api-environmental landscapes show a higher commitment to change. This effect is observed both for farmers with high and low concern for biodiversity depletion. Support for network bridging organisations is foreseen under the EU Leader programme and the EU regulation 1306/2013, which could open-up interesting opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of the current payment scheme for agri-environmental services.

Grassroots innovation research has tended to assume a sharp distinction between grassroots organisations and businesses within niches of socio-technical innovation. However, the non-profit sector literature identifies a tendency for non-profit organisations to actually become more commercially-oriented over time. Seeking to account for this tendency, we develop a conceptual model of the dynamics of grassroots organisations within socio-technical niches. Using a case study of Freegle, a grassroots organisation within the sharing economy niche, we apply the conceptual model to illustrate the causes, processes and outcomes of grassroots niche organisations becoming more commercially-oriented. We show that a grassroots organisation may be subject to coercive and indirect (isomorphic) pressures to become more commercially-oriented and highlight the ambiguities of this dynamic. Furthermore, we highlight that global niche actors may exert coercive pressures that limit the enactment and propagation of the practices and values of grassroots organisations.

Some argue that these relationships should be specified through expert-derived analytical (i.e., top-down) frameworks, in order to organize accumulated knowledge and create ready-made framings for communities on the ground. In contrast, arguments for the participatory construction of ES assessments emphasize the need for place-sensitive and deliberative (i.e., bottom-up) approaches. In this paper, we draw on a novel water planning exercise in New Zealand to examine the tensions that arise when expert-produced categories intersect with diverse stakeholder worldviews and aspirations. Expert-derived ES categories and analyses intervene in local valuation contexts in a range of ways, narrowing the scope of which ecological processes might be considered as relevant or legitimate (bounding), as well as affecting how these processes are described and compared (measuring). The practices of bounding and measuring ES in scientific and planning assessments should thus be conceptualized as involving political work and not just scientific judgment. This reframes the role of ecological science and scientists in ES debates, and this presents cautions as well as opportunities for future ES work relating to policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike hospital and physician services, in which costs are universally covered, most pharmacological therapy does not fall under the umbrella of 'medically necessary' services set out by the Canada Health Act, and therefore is funded through a mix of public and private plans. Little is known about the actual financial burden experienced by Canadians from out-of-pocket drug expenditures (OOPDE). This paper examines the burden of OOPDE in Canada. 1.1% of Canadian households exceed our catastrophic threshold (9%) of the drug budget share. Additionally, 2.6 and 8.2% of households exceed lower thresholds of 6 and 3% respectively. We find an inverse relationship between household income and the burden of OPPDE. Low-income households have the highest likelihood of being in the 'catastrophic' drug expenditure category. This finding suggests that a vulnerable population of 'working poor' are likely to be experiencing disproportionate financial burden because they are not eligible for public assistance programs. Seniors experience the highest burden of OPPDE when compared to other age groups. We also find that there is significant interprovincial variation in the burden of OOPDE, which partly reflects different provincial government drug coverage policies.","[Caldbick, Sam; Wu, Xiaojing; Lynch, Tom; Al-Khatib, Naser; Andkhoie, Mustafa; Farag, Marwa] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Publ Hlth, 104 Clin Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Farag, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Publ Hlth, 104 Clin Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada.",sam.caldbick@usask.ca; xiw292@mail.usask.ca; thl581@mail.usask.ca; naser.alkhatib@usask.ca; mustafa.andkhoie@usask.ca; marwa.farag@usask.ca,"Andkhoie, Mustafa/ABQ-6668-2022","Andkhoie, Mustafa/0000-0002-6600-0797",School of Public Health at the University of Saskatchewan,School of Public Health at the University of Saskatchewan,This analysis was funded by the School of Public Health at the University of Saskatchewan.,,13,9,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

This review article applies the 'ways of knowing' approach to study the relationship between these two discourses. In doing so, we uncover how IWRM has been narrowly construed as a prescriptive way of knowing water based largely on technical-scientific knowledge, while water security represents a discursive way of knowing water with a greater consideration of human values, ethics and power. We argue that these two ways of knowing are complementary rather than conflicting. As both discourses are pursued at multiple levels, the practical way of knowing will emerge to represent how these concepts interact in a specific policy context.","[Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Mukhtarov, Farhad] ADA Univ, Baku, Azerbaijan",University of Arizona; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; ADA University,"Gerlak, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",agerlak@u.arizona.edu,"Mukhtarov, Farhad/ABA-8686-2021; Mukhtarov, Farhad/AAY-7664-2021; Mukhtarov, Farhad/R-1758-2016","Mukhtarov, Farhad/0000-0002-0827-6293; Mukhtarov, Farhad/0000-0002-0827-6293",,,,,105,35,41,1,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

When some high-productivity firms engage in multiplant production, a reduction in transport costs causes two changes in a small region: the closure of plants by high-productivity multiplant firms and the relocation of low-productivity single-plant firms to the region. In the presence of high-productivity multiplant firms, therefore, a decline in transport costs reinforces the spatial sorting of firms by productivity, enlarging the productivity gap between large and small regions. Conversely, reducing investment costs weakens the spatial sorting effects on regional productivity disparities.","Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Saito, H (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.",saitoh@econ.hokudai.ac.jp,"Saito, Hisamitsu/E-5761-2014","Saito, Hisamitsu/0000-0002-8090-3538","JSPS KAKENHI [24780213]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058, 15K17042, 24780213] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I thank Munisamy Gopinath at Oregon State University, Toshihiro Okubo at Keio University, Yasuhiro Sato at Osaka University, two anonymous referees, and JRS Co-Editor Gianmarco Ottaviano for valuable suggestions on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Using survey data from Tharaka-Nithi County, we find 100% of millet and sorghum farmers in the study area scare birds from their plot, devoting 43-66% of all labour time to this activity when these crops are grown in monocrop plots and 24-47% of labour time in plots where millet and sorghum are grown in combination with other crops. This labour allocation is in stark contrast to farmers of all other crops who dedicate almost no time to bird scaring. Individually scaring birds from their plot, farmers achieve a 'momentary Pareto optimal', perpetuating a 'ripple effect' whereby the negative cost of birds are continuously shifted from one farmer to the next. We systematically examine this cost-shifting behaviour as an externality, theoretically applying environmental and resource economics (ERE) policy prescriptions for externality internalisation. ERE, however, with its focus on self-interest, rational actors and technological interventions, falls short to present effective solutions to this so-called externality. Farmers in the region can address crop raids by birds through collective, coordinated action. At this scale, the negative cost of pests is deliberately distributed across all receptors, leading to long-term, community-wide social wellbeing improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The heterogeneity in the organizational form and size of banks has been represented with the Aggregated Malmquist Productivity Index (Zelenyuk in Eur J Oper Res 174:1076-1086, 2006) and the bootstrap techniques (Simar and Wilson in Eur J Oper Res 115:459-471, 1999) extended to this index. Our findings indicate that both branch and subsidiary banks respond to the financial crisis with productivity improvements and, in both cases, this improvement is driven primarily by a positive technical change. However, the branch banks outperform the subsidiary banks. In addition, for the three categories of big, medium and small banks, we find a positive productivity reaction to the crisis, driven by a technical change. However, because small banks not only respond to the financial crisis with improvements in the technical change but also in the scale efficiency change, they appear to reach a higher productivity growth, compared with larger banks, as a response to the financial crisis.","[Curi, Claudia] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy; [Lozano-Vivas, Ana] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Universidad de Malaga,"Curi, C (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy.",claudia.curi@unibz.it; avivas@uma.es,"curi, claudia/AAY-5339-2020; LOZANO-VIVAS, ANA/L-5058-2014","LOZANO-VIVAS, ANA/0000-0001-7965-7061; Curi, Claudia/0000-0003-1483-8640","Luxembourg Fonds National de la Recherche (through the PERFILUX project); Central Bank of Luxembourg; Faculty of Economics and Management, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (through the TECH-BANK project); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-26996]","Luxembourg Fonds National de la Recherche (through the PERFILUX project)(Luxembourg National Research Fund); Central Bank of Luxembourg; Faculty of Economics and Management, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (through the TECH-BANK project); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","The authors are grateful for the comments received from Subal C.

Requiring the collaboration of local and international civil society stakeholders, firms, and donor and host governments, REDO + is inherently a multi-level governance project, but to date participation in REDD + and coordination across governmental levels have been weak. Combining literature on multi-level and polycentric governance of socioecological systems with transaction-cost economics, we argue that transaction costs structure cross-level information-sharing and collaboration relationships among organizations engaged in REDD+ policy development at the national and provincial levels in Indonesia. Using an exponential random graph modelling approach with data collected from interviews with over 80 organizations between 2010 and 2012, We find that powerful organizations tend to dominate cross-level connections, though this effect is somewhat mediated by organizational similarity, which reduces transaction costs. We suggest that explicit efforts to help local organizations overcome the transaction costs of building cross-level relationships will be a central component of building an effective and equitable multi-level governance system for REDD + in Indonesia.

Both single-bounded and double-bounded survey methods were considered, and, with respect to double-bounded methods, the potential for anomalous response behaviour was also taken into account The results generally confirm that there are statistically significant welfare benefits to be derived from community forestry; however, the range of the estimated benefits is large. After controlling for anomalous response behaviour, the range of estimated benefits narrows, and our preferred estimates place the welfare gain between Ethiopian Bin (ETB) 20.14 and 30.41 per household, which is much lower than the estimated benefits without controlling for anomalous preference responses.

Assuming median voter preferences prevail, periods of economic prosperity are likely to be conducive, and economic downturns are likely to be detrimental to ambitious climate policy. Using original surveys in the United States and Germany, we engage in a critical re-assessment of this claim. The results show that, for the most part, individuals' perceptions of their own economic situations have no significant effect on their policy support. Negative perceptions of the national economic outlook reduce support for climate policy in the US, but not in Germany. However, the magnitude of this national economy effect in the US is small. On the other hand, individuals' climate risk perceptions consistently have a statistically significant and large effect across various model specifications, and interestingly, this pattern holds for the US, whose government is among the less ambitious in global climate policy, as well as Germany, which is among the frontrunners. Our study indicates that the state of the economy may not trump climate risk considerations as conventional wisdom claims.

The HP models reveal nonlinear noise depreciation increasing from 0.40 to 2.38 percent per decibel as noise increases, while the SC noise values are lower in an area with high long-term noise exposure. These nonlinearities are attributed to the spatial sorting of noise tolerant individuals.

We use data from the Eurobarometer 67.3 for 18 European countries and estimate a three simultaneous equations model taking into account the potential endogeneity of labor participation and formal care unmet needs and assuming non-zero correlation among the error terms of the three equations. Results show that individuals who anticipate that becoming caregiver can suppose an obstacle for continuing working feel more refractory and are more prone to avoid caregiving responsibilities. Knowing someone with an unmet needs problem increases the probability of becoming caregiver by +19.23 pp (with a maximum of +39.39 pp for difficult access unmet needs) and raises the probability of leaving employment by 5.77 pp. Having to possibility of receiving economic benefits for caregivers encourage more labor market exit as compared to payment of social security contributions during care leaves.","[Vilaplana Prieto, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Espinardo S-N, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Vilaplana Prieto, Cristina; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",University of Murcia; Pompeu Fabra University,"Prieto, CV (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus Espinardo S-N, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",cvilaplana@um.es,"Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/D-6744-2013","Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/0000-0002-7393-9612","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2011-30323-C03-02, ECO2011-2850]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),Financial help from project ECO2011-30323-C03-02 and ECO2011-2850 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology is gratefully acknowledged.,,76,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

The buyers have an outside option to buy the same good for a commonly known posted price that also acts as an informative upper bound on the cost the NYOP retailer faces. We conceptualize a selling strategy of such an NYOP retailer to be the probability that a buyer's bid gets accepted. The selling strategy is a function of only the bid level; it does not depend on the particular realization of the retailer's procurement cost. Using mechanism-design techniques, we characterize the optimal selling strategy and the equilibrium bidding function that best responds to it. We show that the optimal strategy implements the first-best ex-post optimal mechanism: for every cost realization, the retailer can make as much profit as he would if he could learn his cost first and use the optimal mechanism contingent on it. The complexity involved in credibly communicating an entire bid-acceptance function to buyers can make the first-best strategy impractical in some real-world markets, so we also analyze several simpler NYOP strategies: setting a minimum bid, charging a participation fee, and accepting all bids above cost. We find that under many scenarios, the minimum-bid strategy dominates the other simpler strategies and achieves a majority of the maximal profit improvement available from the first best strategy. However, NYOP retailers in thin markets can do better by charging participation fees than by setting minimum bids.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Zeithammer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rzeitham@ucla.edu,,,,,,,24,4,4,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

An analysis of firm-level panel data from the Indian manufacturing sector from 2000-2001 to 2007-2008 employing the semi-parametric method of Levinsohn-Petrin to correct the endogeneity bias in productivity estimation shows productivity improvements in domestic firms due to vertical technology spillovers are only through backward linkages from FDI. The study confirms that firms in high-technology industries benefit more from vertical technology spillovers from foreign firms compared to firms in low-technology industries. It also shows that minority-owned foreign firms are more prone to technology spillovers than majority-owned foreign firms. Nonetheless, domestic firms in high-technology industries are able to access both horizontal as well as vertical technology spillovers from majority-owned foreign firms. The paper concludes that technology spillovers from FDI are not spontaneous, but are constrained by the technological ability of domestic firms and the ownership structure of foreign firms.","Ctr Dev Studies, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India",,"Malik, SK (通讯作者)，Ctr Dev Studies, Prasanth Nagar Rd, Trivandrum 695011, Kerala, India.",mksanjaya@gmail.com,"MALIK, SANJAYA KUMAR/AAV-8574-2020","MALIK, SANJAYA KUMAR/0000-0001-7086-8903",,,,,48,20,23,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The analysis extends two approaches now commonly used in efficiency and productivity analysis: data envelopment analysis where convexity is imposed; and free disposal hull (FDH) models. We argue that, while the FDH model allows for non-convexity, its representation of non-convexity is too extreme. We propose a new nonparametric model that relies on a neighborhood-based technology assessment which allows for less extreme forms of non-convexity. The distinctive feature of our approach is that it allows for non-convexity to arise in any part of the feasible set. We show how it can be implemented empirically by solving simple linear programming problems. And we illustrate the usefulness of the approach in an empirical application to the analysis of technical and scale efficiency on Korean farms.","[Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kim, Kwansoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Seoul National University (SNU),"Chavas, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Taylor Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jchavas@wisc.edu; kimk@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the most valued attributes of red lentils and to assess how consumer preferences vary across store type and by socio- demographic factors. Thereby, it was aimed to identify value chain interventions that are required to meet the consumer demand. Design/methodology/approach - Sri Lanka was selected as the study location because of its significance as an importer. Through an intercept survey of 300 consumers in three store types, consumption pattern and preference for four attributes of red lentils, namely, size, colour, visual quality and price were collected. Data were also collected from retail and wholesale stores and from a processor. Conjoint analysis was used to analyse the consumer data. Findings - A majority of the respondents consumed red lentils on a daily basis. Consumer preference rankings showed that consumers place a significantly greater level of importance on visual quality than other attributes. Trade- off patterns were different across store types and by socio- demographic factors. Grocery shoppers were willing to trade- off packaging to price while the reverse was true for supermarket shoppers. Retail and wholesale purchases were driven by quality. Research limitations/implications - Findings highlight that chain effectiveness could be enhanced by offering bigger sized lentils while assuring quality.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is of theoretical and empirical character. In the theoretical part, the cognitive-and-critical analysis of the world's literature on marketing and marketing management was applied. In the empirical part, such research methods were used as: questionnaire survey for gathering primary data and statistical analysis (including factor analysis and cluster analysis) for the analysis of the primary data and for the statistical reasoning, which made the basis for the final conclusions. Findings - On the basis of the research, it is possible to state that: environmental features of dairy product packaging are of great significance for the respondents, and meeting their expectations in this respect influences positively their buying decisions. Originality/value - The original contribution of the paper to theory is the identification of Polish purchasers' expectations toward elements of dairy product packaging in the context of their buying decisions taken thanks to the fact that their expectations concerning the features of packaging are fulfilled. This knowledge makes it possible for offerers to manage efficiently and effectively dairy product packaging as a tool of influencing recipients, as well as to shape properly and use their marketing potential, which, in turn, determines the applicability value of the research and the conclusions drawn on the basis of the results.","[Baruk, Agnieszka Izabela] Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Syst Innovat Management, Lublin, Poland; [Iwanicka, Anna] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Management, Lublin, Poland",Lodz University of Technology; University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Baruk, AI (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Syst Innovat Management, Lublin, Poland.",agnieszka.baruk@poczta.onet.pl,"Baruk, Agnieszka/M-4470-2018","Baruk, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2864-509X",,,,,47,8,8,4,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The research question is focussed on determining whether the ENFR is hampering the market potential of insect-based food products in the European Union (EU). The authors position this question within the domain of regulatory barriers related to food innovations. Design/methodology/approach - Using a choice experiment, the authors assess the presence and relevance of these failures through the analysis of consumers' acceptance and WTP for insect-based food products with different product attributes directly imposed by the ENFR. Namely, the authors assess the effect of the visualization of insects in the product, the use of logo, and nutritional information. Findings - The results show that consumers prefer and are willing to pay a premium price for insect-based products with a nutritional health claim and logo, but they are not willing to pay for a product with a visualized insect.

Due to the growing attention to sustainability, and the international trend toward agricultural trades and stakeholder involvement in food, there is a need for a system-based approach in the field of food systems sustainability. Design/methodology/ approach - In total, 12 semi-structured individual interviews were conducted among marketing managers working for different organizations within the Quebec hog marketing channel. The organizations chosen vary depending on the size, level of integration and involvement in the industry, to create a sample that adequately represents the industry. For the purpose of this research, three primary producers, one veterinarian, three licenced abattoirs, one food processor, one distributor, one independent retailer and two types of food service facility, one from a franchise system and the other from a high-end restaurant were questioned regarding the current state of the industry, as well as the impact of sustainable development on their strategic plans. Findings - The Canadian hog and pork industry is currently facing strong competition from several fronts: the USA and South America, a population with increasingly sophisticated demands, a strong Canadian dollar and a significant increase in input costs, particularly in respect to oil and corn. To be able to meet this competition, and in order to prosper in an uncertain marketplace, marketing channel believes that it must reduce its production costs, increase product awareness in the domestic market and promote cooperation among industry members. Research limitations/implications - This research is mainly concerned with the Quebec hog industry. External validity has not been achieved with the current research. In addition, a lack of distributor availability to answer the interview questions limits researchers' capacity to extrapolate results to all retailers. Meetings with other food distributors would be required to verify the accuracy of results. Although this study is exploratory in nature, several appealing research avenues emerge. First, the research focusses primarily on members of the distribution network, but does not consider the consumers' point of view. It would be fruitful to study the impact of sustainable development on the perceived product quality by measuring consumers' intent to purchase. Practical implications - The principal point of interest that makes this case worthy of study and of potential application to future business modeling is how sustainability and sustainable development is perceived throughout various marketing channels. The Quebec hog industry faces strong competition from several countries that are able to offer a similar product at a lower cost. The mature market consists of a limited number of producers interested in offering a product on themarket at the lowest possible price. Social implications - When it comes to sustainable development and the hog industry, the economic and environmental aspects seem to be well understood by members of the industry. On the other hand, the social aspect of sustainability is not mentioned frequently and is often not a part of the leaders' main concerns. Nevertheless, members of the industry agree that sustainable development affects the Quebec hog value chain, and will remain a topic of interest in the coming years. Originality/value - To the knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate the use of sustainability as strategic cornerstone for a marketing channel in a mature market, particularly in the hog industry. Many studies have been conducted in a context of emerging markers. However, very few studies addressed the issue in an established economic environment.","[Labrecque, Joanne; Dulude, Bertrand] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Charlebois, Sylvain] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Guelph,"Charlebois, S (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@uoguelph.ca,,"Charlebois, Sylvain/0000-0002-9400-0153",,,,,80,6,6,2,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Specifically, the authors analyze the extent to which the different denominations of olive oil prevent consumers from distinguishing among the types of olive oil. Furthermore, the authors analyze whether the current generic names of olive oil affect consumer perceptions regarding the product's various qualities and characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The authors performed an experiment with 128 participants divided into two groups (experimental n = 64 and control n = 64). In the pretest, participants completed a survey with 12 terms related to olive oil. The experimental group was then trained in the meaning of each term, after which the group returned to complete the same survey. Findings - The authors can confirm H1 and H2. Results show that there is no clear knowledge regarding some of these terms. Social implications - This study provides positive implications to both consumers, providing them a clear information, and producers and marketers, helping distinguish in the market olive oils of more quality.

More specifically, the authors investigate how ethnocentrism, perceived risk, and external influences affect their adjustment processes by considering three different temporal stages and exploring adjustment in relation to dietary practices. Design/methodology/approach - After performing an in-depth review of the relevant literature, a structural equation analysis is conducted. This analysis relies on data from a sample of 139 international students enrolled in a Spanish university. Findings - The results reveal that ethnocentrism is significant only in the second stage of the adjustment process. The level of perceived risk decreases during the adjustment process but also depends on the features international students have in common with the host culture; in contrast, external influences are important in all stages. Research limitations/implications - International students should not be treated the same way during different stages of their adjustment. For example, during the first stage, the focus should be on minimizing their perceived risk and guaranteeing a safe environment in which they feel comfortable with buying. The role of the media and the training of salespeople should be highlighted in the second stage of adjustment. Practical implications - The dietary adjustment for this group of short-term migrants is different than other groups, which tend to return to their country of origin. In contrast, international university students try to assimilate the host culture and be part of it. Social implications - In the context of consumption, because international university students are influenced by all constructs detailed in this study, it is necessary to formulate a specific approach for each stage. Originality/value - This research evidences how there is a great opportunity for diverse operators (e.g. universities, food retail chains) to influence the consumption habits of international university students, because they are more receptive than other migrant groups.","[Pilar Martinez-Ruiz, Maria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Mkt, Albacete, Spain; [Tirelli, Christian] Fac Desenvolvimento Rio Grande Sul FADERGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Izquierdo-Yusta, Alicia] Univ Burgos, Fac Ciencias Econ, Burgos, Spain; [Gomez-Ladron-De-Guevara, Ricardo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Agronomos, Albacete, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Burgos; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Martínez-Ruiz, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Mkt, Albacete, Spain.",MariaPilar.Martinez@uclm.es,"Izquierdo-Yusta, Alicia/L-1489-2017; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/IUM-9361-2023; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/B-7200-2012","Izquierdo-Yusta, Alicia/0000-0001-5894-6577; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Martinez-Ruiz, Maria/0000-0002-5890-5174; Gomez Ladron de Guevara, Ricardo/0000-0003-3430-0346","Planificacion e Implementacion de Estrategias de Gestion Optimas Del PDV Fisico, Online y Movil a Partir de Las Tic y La Innovacion, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [ECO2014-59688-R]","Planificacion e Implementacion de Estrategias de Gestion Optimas Del PDV Fisico, Online y Movil a Partir de Las Tic y La Innovacion, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain)","This work was funded by Research Project ECO2014-59688-R, Planificacion e Implementacion de Estrategias de Gestion Optimas Del PDV Fisico, Online y Movil a Partir de Las Tic y La Innovacion, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain).",,99,3,6,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

An e-mail questionnaire is used to collect data, with aim to determine the influence of firm characteristics on marketing strategy selection and implementation. Descriptive statistics, difference between group tests, and correlation are used in data analysis. Findings - Results indicate that large and foreign-owned firms opt for standardization of the product, distribution and promotion, while they prefer an adaptation strategy for price. These firms have fewer difficulties implementing selected strategies compared to small businesses and domestically owned firms. The impact of export experience is mixed and less influential. Research limitations/implications - The main research limitations relate to the one country case, but results offer several implications for researchers, management of agri-food exporters, policy makers and society. Originality/value - This paper presents the original insight from agri-food exporters originated from one small, emerging economy for all marketing mix elements. Due Serbian case uniqueness it challenges previous findings and provide a laboratory for testing export marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach - Secondary data comes from the database of origin and registration. In total, 235 product names registered in the database for cheeses and cheese products were analyzed according to type of label and country of origin. To discover a dependences between the variables, chi(2) test and contingency coefficients were calculated. Hierarchical clustering method enabled to identify the clusters of countries with similar distribution of products in the database. Findings - More than 80 percent of cheeses and cheese products are certified with PDO. Leading countries in number of certified products are France and Italy. Taking into account all product classes in the database, only 6 percent of all PGIs, 33 percent of PDOs and 15 percent of TSGs were awarded for cheeses and cheese products. A middle weak correlation between the number of certified products and the country of origin was confirmed. Research limitations/implications - The number of certified products is continuously increasing, their distribution between countries may change slightly over time. Only cluster analysis and two criteria of comparison were used. Practical implications - To local food producers, the findings provide a more deep insight to the EU cheese market.

Findings - Three quarters of the sample reported they often or always cooked from scratch (CFS). More women than men always CFS; fewer 18-29 year olds did so often or always but more of the over 50s always did so; fewer single people CFS than cohabiting people. No statistically significant ethnic, educational background or household income differences were found. High levels of cooking from scratch were associated with interest in learning more about cooking, greater use of most cooking techniques (except microwaves), meat and legume preparation techniques, and the use of broader ranges of herbs, spice, liquids/ sauces, other ingredients and cooking utensils. Research limitations/implications - In future work a numerical description of the frequency of cooking from scratch should be considered along with a wider range of response options. The data were derived from an online panel from which men were oversampled. Caution is required in comparisons between men and women respondents. The cross-sectional nature of the sample prevents any causal attributions from being drawn from the observed relationships. Further replication of the findings, especially the lack of association with educational background should be conducted. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the associations of demographic characteristics and cooking practices with cooking from scratch. The findings suggest that cooking from scratch is common among Australian family food providers and signifies interest in learning about cooking and involvement in a wide range of cooking techniques.","[Worsley, Anthony; Wang, Wei Chun; Wijeratne, Pradeep; Ismail, Sinem; Ridley, Stacey] Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Burwood, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Worsley, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Burwood, Vic, Australia.",tonyw@deakin.edu.au,"Wang, Wei Chun/I-1444-2016","Wang, Wei Chun/0000-0003-4287-1704; Worsley, Anthony/0000-0002-4635-6059",Meat and Livestock Australia,Meat and Livestock Australia(Meat and Livestock Australia),"This research was supported by a grant from Meat and Livestock Australia.

I investigate whether wartime rent control played a role in this shift. The empirical test exploits variation in rent reductions across cities that had similar increases in rents prior to control. This variation does not appear to be correlated with underlying trends also driving home ownership. Greater initial rent reductions led to larger increases in home ownership; rent control can account for a significant share of the increase in home ownership over the early 1940s.","[Fetter, Daniel K.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Fetter, Daniel K.] NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fetter, DK (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.;Fetter, DK (通讯作者)，NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dfetter@wellesley.edu,,,Taubman Center for State and Local Government; Real Estate Academic Initiative at Harvard; Wellesley College,Taubman Center for State and Local Government; Real Estate Academic Initiative at Harvard; Wellesley College,"For helpful comments I thank Richard Arnott, Jeremy Atack, John Bellows, Price Fishback, Eric Hilt, Lee Lockwood, Hugh Rockoff, Ken Snowden, Richard Sutch, John Wallis, Heidi Williams, and seminar participants at Arizona, Harvard, Stanford, Vanderbilt, Wellesley, Yale, the Washington Area Economic History Seminar, the 2012 Cliometrics Conference, the 2012 NBER Summer Institute, the 2013 AREUEA Annual Meeting, the 2013 AALAC Mellon 23 Workshop, and the May 2014 All-UC Conference.

This article takes advantage of a natural experiment created by the end of the Soviet planned economy in 1991, which had geographically distributed R&D manpower according to planned needs as opposed to a distribution determined by a market economy. It examines the extent to which the planned economy created a path-dependence in the location of post-Soviet human-capital intensive production. The study finds that regions with more R&D personnel in 1991 did better in the development of modern market-oriented knowledge-intensive business services, like engineering and IT.

However, empirical studies show that inefficiency in production is common indicating that the rationality assumption is not met. Furthermore, substantial evidence exists to suggest that the contributions of environmental inputs in particular may be differentiated across the efficiency distribution. This means that the frontier technology may not be an appropriate reflection of the technology in use by inefficient enterprises. This article presents the use of conditional regression quantiles to consider how the value of environmental inputs, measured by their contributions to production, vary across efficiency quantiles. We employed a case study of rangelands beef production in Australia to consider how environmental health differentially contributes to production values across efficiency quantiles. Our approach generates detailed insights into the nature of environmentally-sourced technical inefficiency and suggests that conditional quantile regression approaches are ideal for consideration of issues wherein substantial heterogeneity exists limiting the information content of conditional mean based analyses.

When offsets are used for compliance, it is important that they are additional in the sense that the payment from the trading program induces environmental benefits that would not occur without the program. In this paper we analyze a water quality trading program in Ohio, U.S., to estimate the extent to which the offsets are additional. Using data from the program and a farmer survey, we estimate the number of additional conservation practices that are adopted by farmers who participated in the trading program relative to the counterfactual outcome without the program. Using matching methods, we find no statistically significant increase in the number of conservation practices due to the trading program. We also examine whether the trading program may have crowded out government funding. We also do not find significant evidence for such crowding out, instead finding some evidence that the trading program may have led to greater participation in federal cost-share programs.

Biodiversity conservation policymaking is still understudied. In this study, this gap is empirically addressed on a sample of 48 sub-Saharan countries over the 1990-2009 period taking the Ecoregion protection score provided by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) as a measure of biodiversity conservation policies. It is sought whether economic incentives such as biodiversity targeted international transfers as well as tourism revenues have an impact on biodiversity conservation policies. Moreover, spillover effects are also hypothesized owing to the public good character of biodiversity conservation policies. International financial assistance as well as tourism are found to have an effect on biodiversity conservation policymaldng. Our results also evidence complementary spatial spillover effects between biodiversity conservation policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Part of the justification for Canada's reluctance to commit to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions is the country's status as fossil fuel exporter. In this paper we use input-output analysis and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to ask whether Canada's contribution to global GHG emissions changes when calculated using a demand-based shadow emission approach that excludes GHG emissions created in the production of exports like fossil fuels, but includes emissions released to produce imports to Canada. We find that from 1995 to 2005 Canada's contribution to global emissions was lower using this demand-based GHG accounting approach than a production-based approach. From 2006 to 2009 however, increased imports from GHG-intensive trading partners like China meant that Canada's demand-based shadow emissions were higher than its production-based GHG emissions. We also introduce a method of calculating sub-national GHG shadows using limited data. Applied to Canada this exercise demonstrates that fossil fuel exporting provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan have demand-based shadow emissions significantly lower than their production-based emissions, while populous provinces such as Quebec and Ontario have demand-based emissions that are relatively higher than their production-based emissions.

A data set of 60 observations drawn from 32 studies is constructed. The relative economic values of different types of externalities as well as the impact of various methodological and sample characteristics on welfare estimates are examined. The results indicate a significant effect of visual externalities on welfare estimates in both directions, i.e., a positive effect of visual improvements and a negative effect of deteriorations. This finding corresponds to predictions of the importance of visual impacts in the social science literature. External effects of wind power on biodiversity (mainly birds) do not affect welfare estimates. Indirect externalities caused by conventional sources of electricity that can be avoided by wind power, such as a the reduction of air pollution, do neither have a significant impact on welfare measures. Methodologically, we find substantial but inelastic income effects and, for choice experiments, clear evidence of sensitivity to scope. From a policy point of view, our results suggest that a policy mix combining a promotion of wind turbines with another green policy facilitates expansion of wind energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, northern industrialized economies have been responsible for the majority of resource consumption, while developing countries have suffered the associated social and environmental impacts. This article analyzes the extra-territorial responsibility of the Basque economy (Europe), to illustrate the responsibility of northern open economies towards the global environment. To do this, we: (i) analyze the material and energy flows of the Basque economy, their source and impacts on other regions of the world, (ii) study the impact of the economic and investment activities of Basque companies abroad, and (iii) examine, together with other paradigmatic examples, three case studies from Latin-America, East Africa and Southeast Asia that represent the liabilities of northern economies in the Global South. This approach allows us to connect production and consumption processes in affluent countries with associated socio-ecological impacts in the extraction frontiers in order to better understand and potentially transform current economic patterns and their consequences. In addition, the study indicates how to bridge the gap between local and global scales, creating a useful approach to raising social awareness and informing public policies in resource intensive societies.

We examine the trade-off between risk reduction and affordability in a model of public private flood insurance in France and Germany estimating household flood adaptation decisions in response to financial insurance incentives. An integrated model of household level mitigation behaviour and insurance premiums is developed. The model investigates how aggregated household adaptation behaviour differs under financial incentives as compared to when households act on their own subjective risk beliefs. The results indicate that insurance based incentives are able to promote adaptation. The incentives could reduce residential flood risk by 12% in Germany and 24% in France by 2040. The higher level of flood risk in France results in a strong present incentive to reduce risk. Rapid growth of flood risks in Germany results in more effective incentives in later periods. Insurance is unaffordable for approximately 20% of households at risk. Providing vouchers, to correct for unaffordability, after 2040 has a lower cost than the total incentivised damage reduction. A policy recommendation is that strengthening the link between flood insurance and financial incentives can guide household level adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It showed a curvilinear relationship with the second serfdom', as proxied by landlord presence on village holdings. Landlord presence in serf villages also reversed the positive effects of female headship and mills on non-agricultural activities.

Using data from New Orleans newspapers, we find that most sales advertisements include information about the slave's occupation. A comparison of the advertisement with the corresponding sales invoice shows that the slave's occupation was often omitted from the invoice. Because the slave's market price should reflect all relevant information available at the time of sale, the informational value of the slave's advertised occupation can be estimated using regression analysis.

We analyze the wage dynamics of migrants from lower to higher density areas in Italy, using quantile regressions and individual data. The results show that unskilled workers benefit more from a wage premium accruing over time, while skilled workers enjoy a wage premium when they migrate as well as a wage increase over time. Further, we find that for unskilled workers the wage growth over time is mainly due to human capital accumulation in line with the learning hypothesis, while for skilled workers the wage growth is mainly explained by the coordination hypothesis, i.e., cities enhance the probability of better matches between workers and firms.","[Matano, Alessia] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Matano, Alessia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Social Anal, Rome, Italy; [Naticchioni, Paolo] Univ Rome Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via Gabriello Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Naticchioni, Paolo] IZA, Navarra, Spain",University of Barcelona; Sapienza University Rome; Roma Tre University,"Matano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Matano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Social Anal, Rome, Italy.;Naticchioni, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rome Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via Gabriello Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy.;Naticchioni, P (通讯作者)，IZA, Navarra, Spain.",amatano@ub.edu; paolo.naticchioni@uniroma3.it,"matano, alessia/E-6616-2016","matano, alessia/0000-0002-0008-385X",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-41022-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We thank the research partnership between ISFOL - Area Mercato del Lavoro (Rome) - and Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali ed Economiche - University of Rome La Sapienza - for access to the databases.

Institutions, mining companies, and affected groups hired scientists to back their arguments in these disputes. The main objective of the experts was to determine the influence of dust, fumes and especially gases, such as sulfur dioxide, on health and vegetation. Controversies led to an intense exchange of experiences and theoretical proposals in some European and, from the first decade of the 20th century, North American mining basins. Thus, the smoke smelter debate represents an interesting precursor of atmospheric pollution science before the Age of Ecology. This article analyzes this research through the study of conflicts from the 19th until the mid-20th century while emphasizing the strong influence exerted by big mining corporations, which have decisively conditioned its evolution. The complexity of research on an international and long-term problem, such as smelter smoke, gave place to an early and intense controversy on the limits and possibilities of science. Therefore, the last part of this article compares the arguments used in the mining conflicts which have been studied to some of the ideas presented by critical theories on normal science, as Post-normal Science.

Proper removal of debris is of great importance because it blocks roads and prohibits emergency aid teams from accessing disaster affected regions. Poor disaster management, lack of efficiency and delays in debris removal cause disruptions in providing shelter, nutrition, healthcare and communication services to disaster victims, and more importantly, result in loss of lives. Due to the importance of systematic and efficient debris removal from the perspectives of improving disaster victims quality of life and allowing the transportation of emergency relief materials, the focus of this study is on providing emergency relief supplies to disaster affected regions as soon as possible by unblocking roads through removing the accumulated debris. We develop a mathematical model for the problem that requires long CPU times for large instances. Since it is crucial to act quickly in an emergency case, we also propose a heuristic methodology that solves instances with an average gap of 1% and optimum ratio of 80.83%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A period of economic growth revealed the existing measures as inefficient for reduction of regional economic disparities in the countries due to potentially adverse effect of economic boost on convergence. During economic recession, lacking the financial resources, the objective to reduce regional economic disparities becomes too difficult to implement both in the EU advanced countries and developing ones. The listed reasons determine the relevance of research area and require reassessment of regional economic disparities in the EU countries and underlying causes thereof, considering different national economic level of the EU members and their distinct economic growth, integration to common free market zone as well as different market economy experience.

J,"Fontana, G; Sawyer, M",,,,"Fontana, Giuseppe; Sawyer, Malcolm",,,Towards post-Keynesian ecological macroeconomics,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ecological economics; Sustainability; Post-Keynesian; Monetary Circuit; Kaleckian; Demand-led growth,INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; ECONOMICS; POLICY,"The paper starts with a brief criticism of macroeconomic analyses of different schools of thought for their focus on economic growth and maximisation of output. This applies to the traditional Keynesian approach, which has focused on the achievement of sufficient aggregate demand to underpin full employment and full capacity utilisation, down-playing aggregate supply constraints. This also applies to the neoclassical approach, including the current New Consensus Macroeconomics approach, which asserts the dominant role of aggregate supply in the long run, and where growth is set by the so-called 'natural rate of growth', with no concerns over environmental and ecological issues. The paper then proposes a different approach to macroeconomic analysis. It explicitly acknowledges that economic growth is a double-edged sword. Growth can help to alleviate persistent levels of high unemployment, but it can also lead to potentially catastrophic environmental problems. Building on the Monetary Circuit theory and the Demand-led growth theory, the paper offers an analysis of the interconnections and interdependence of the economic, biophysical and social worlds and by doing it hopes to provide the building blocks for the establishment of post-Keynesian ecological macroeconomics.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were applied to a sample of 150 consumers, selected by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. A factorial analysis by principal component analysis was performed to the data, followed by a cluster analysis. Findings - Four factors were obtained, named: artisanship, health and well-being, liking, and satisfaction with the purchase. Three consumer groups were identified: practical, in the process of valorization, and with liking and tradition. The socioeconomic characteristics of consumers do not have a relationship in the classification of groups. It is concluded that the consumption of fresh cheeses is due to a number of social and cultural attributes, and in lesser proportion, to economic aspects. Originality/value - At present, as part of life in a dynamic society, people have the power of choice in the food they consume, a process that involves cultural, social, economic, political, and ideological aspects, established by the consumers themselves, or by a determined social group to which they belong. This has not been researched in Mexico. Being an emerging economy immersed in a rapid process of globalization, studies like this contribute in similar countries of Latin America and other places to find ways to valorize local foods and products that play important roles in the development of rural communities.","[Hidalgo-Milpa, Minerva; Manuel Arriaga-Jordan, Carlos; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico; [Cesin-Vargas, Alfredo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Estudios Reg Coordinac Humanidades, Mexico City, Michoacan, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Espinoza-Ortega, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico.",angelica.cihuatl@gmail.com,"Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/D-7453-2016","Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/0000-0002-5968-0587",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT - Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia),Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT - Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),Authors express their gratitude to the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT - Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) for the postgraduate grant that enabled Minerva Hidalgo-Milpa to undertake doctoral studies.,,57,18,22,1,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the trend of regional food consumption and the influencing factors for consumer preferences of regional meat products. For the first time cognitive, normative and affective attributes, as well as point of purchase and socio-demographic characteristics, were put together in a conceptual framework to investigate which factors are influencing consumer preferences for regional meat products. Design/methodology/approach - A representative sample of German consumers was surveyed in 2014. After measuring the determinants of perceived quality of regional meat products, an attribute-level factor analysis were used to test inter-dependence between the variables. All five factors, accounting for 77 percent of the sample, were examined by a binary logistic regression model. Findings - Logit regression analysis found that three factors, including normative and affective attributes, significantly affect and influence consumer preferences for regional meat products, whereas cognitive attributes have no significant influence on consumer preferences. Originality/value - The findings have interesting implications for retailers with respect to meat marketing activities, as well as for researchers with respect to further research on regional meat products. Though, it comes out that it is promising to concentrate on normative and affective attributes regarding product presentation and meat marketing of regional meat products.","[Paustian, Margit; Reinecke, Franziska-Elisabeth; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Paustian, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",margit.paustian@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,"Paustian, Margit/0000-0002-1316-7710",,,,,51,10,10,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Seven focus groups across age and gender were conducted. Discussions were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Findings - Strategies that participants felt as important for improving the healthiness of processed meat mainly included the use of better quality meat and less salt, fat, preservatives and other additives. Functional processed meat was a new concept for participants. Four themes were constructed to reflect participants' attitudes towards functional processed meat: opposing views on processed meat as a carrier of healthy ingredients; belief in the health benefits of functional processed meat; perceived value of functional processed meat for different consumer groups; and trust and perceived risk surrounding the functional food concept. A large proportion of the participants were unconvinced about the concept of functional processed meat; however many of the participants expressed an openness to purchase this food product if taste and price remained uncompromised. Research limitations/implications - The sample size of the current study is small. Complementary quantitative research with a more representative sample should be implemented. Adopting a quantitative approach, the findings from this study should be explored further to investigate their application in a representative sample of the population. Originality/value - This study represents a first exploratory investigation of consumer views on functional processed meat. It can inform further consumer and market research in relation to the development of healthier processed meat.","[Shan, Liran Christine; Regan, Aine; Murrin, Celine; Lalor, Fiona; Wall, Patrick G.; McConnon, Aine] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Publ Hlth Physiotherapy & Sports Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Shan, Liran Christine; Regan, Aine; Murrin, Celine; Lalor, Fiona; Wall, Patrick G.; McConnon, Aine] Univ Coll Dublin, Inst Food & Hlth, Dublin, Ireland; [Monahan, Frank J.; Li, Chenguang] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Monahan, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",frank.monahan@ucd.ie,"Regan, Aine/AGE-2896-2022; Murrin, Celine/ABA-3881-2021; Lalor, Fiona/AAM-7128-2021","Regan, Aine/0000-0002-3754-0014; Murrin, Celine/0000-0002-9728-9781;",,,,,57,26,26,4,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Whether work-sharing actually increases employment, however, has been debated controversially. In this article we present stylized facts on the distribution of hours worked and discuss the role of work-sharing for a sustainable economy. Building on recent developments in labor market theory we review the determinants of working long hours and its effect on well-being. Finally, we survey work-sharing reforms in the past. While there seems to be a consensus that work-sharing in the Great Depression in the U.S. and in the Great Recession in Europe was successful in reducing employment losses, perceptions of the work-sharing reforms implemented between the 1980s and early 2000s are more ambivalent. However, even the most critical evaluations of these reforms provide no credible evidence of negative employment effects; instead, the overall success of the policy seems to depend on the economic and institutional setting, as well as the specific details of its implementation.

They all share a common weakness: they measure protection as the ratio of custom revenues to import value, which biases results if demand for imports is not perfectly inelastic. In this article, we show that the measure of protection matters. We estimate the James Anderson and Peter Neary (2005) Trade Restrictiveness Index for Italy from unification to the Great Depression. We suggest a different interpretation of some key moments of Italian trade policy and we show that the aggregate welfare losses were small in the long run and mostly related to protection on sugar in the 1880s and 1890s. We document that using different measures of protection affects results of the causal relation between trade policy on economic growth in Italy and in the United States. Accordingly, we arguethat a systematic re-estimating of protection in the economic history of trade policy is needed.","[Federico, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Vasta, Michelangelo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Siena,"Federico, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",giovanni.federico@unipi.it; michelangelo.vasta@unisi.it,"vasta, michelangelo/ABC-5933-2021","vasta, michelangelo/0000-0002-8683-8095",,,,,62,13,13,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

During the past few decades, the situation has changed, and abandonment of marginal pastures with subsequent forest regrowth has been widely observed. To better understand current drivers, challenges, and policy impacts on the sustainable governance of common property pastures, we present an application of Ostroms' general framework for analyzing social-ecological systems (SESs). We use system dynamics (SD) modeling to operationalize the SES framework for the case study region of Grindelwald, Switzerland. Based on formative scenario analysis, we identify four consistent simulation scenarios. The simulation results show that increasing loss of common property pastures and resulting afforestation can be expected. Scenario assessment shows that policy blueprints such as liberalization or increased government support do not halt but instead accelerate abandonment of common property pastures. We conclude by discussing options for sustainably governing CPPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops and uses an approach to derive the total economic cost of soil degradation in England and Wales. An estimate was made of degradation costs at the national scale for dominant combinations of land cover and soils, defined as 'soilscapes'. An ecosystem services framework was used to assess how degradation affects the capacity of soils to support a range of 'final goods', distinguishing between on-site and off-site costs, and market and non-market effects. Quantifiable soil degradation costs ranged between 0.9 pound bn and 1.4 pound bn per year, with a central estimate of 1.2 pound bn, mainly linked to loss of organic content of soils (47% of total cost), compaction (39%) and erosion (12%). Eighty percent of costs occur off-site and, as such, are often of limited concern to those whose actions may be causing soil degradation. The findings confirm that control of soil degradation has implications for a number of key policy areas such as flood risk management and climate change mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated the GPI for the state of Oregon from 1960-2010. We found that it tracked the Gross State Product (GSP) for the period 1970-2000, but began to diverge and flatten out in 2000. The major reasons for this divergence were increasing inequality, loss of farmland, and decreasing personal consumption expenditures as a fraction of GSP. Oregon GPI/per capita leveled off in 2000, while the US GPI/capita leveled off in 1975. The GPI is not the perfect indicator of economic and social well-being, but it is a better approximation than GDP. As more states and countries begin to recognize the inappropriateness of GDP as a policy goal we can expect to see much more emphasis on and use of alternative indicators like GPI. We recommend extending these indicators to include a comprehensive shareholder's report that reflects all the state's capital assets, including built, human, social, and natural capital.

It is shown theoretically that the standard output elasticity estimation methods may lead to underestimate the role of ICT in generating productivity gaps, when there is a trade-off between speed of introducing technologies and the need to assimilate those as reflected by the inefficiency with which the new technology is used. The trade-off generates leader-follower patterns and mutes the relationship between productivity and ICT. The paper tests several economic hypotheses derived from the theory of technology adaptation using data envelope analysis, a novel growth factorization, and a range of panel econometrics techniques.

We compare the efficiency of three different land use based GHG abatement measures in combination and as separately applied measures: the production of short rotation coppices, of feedstocks for biomethane production, and peatland restoration. We evaluate these options with respect to the following criteria: cost efficiency (GHG abatement costs), abatement potential, and impact on agricultural production. We use the regional supply model RAUMIS to investigate the different abatement measures at the sector and regional level. Up to a reduction of GHG emission of 25 * 10(12) g CO2eq peatland restoration is the most cost efficient option. Short rotation coppice allow some cost-efficient mitigation also only at limited scale. Energy maize is only an option if high abatement targets should be met. The joint implementation of several abatement strategies allows meeting specified targets at lower costs. The crowding out effect between the options is limited. The spatial analysis indicates measure specific regional competitiveness and application e.g. short rotation coppice in Eastern and Southern Germany, peat restoration in Northern Germany and energy maize production in central Germany.

Theory on such 'forest transitions' describes urbanization and agricultural modernization as underling factors. Tropical country governments may seek to harness these factors to promote a tropical forest transition within the REDD+ scheme. Yet tropical forest transitions remain poorly described due to limited data and inappropriate modeling. To determine the nature of a tropical forest transition I derive canonical correlations of (a) socio-agrarian transformation observed via respondent-level census records and (b) forest-cover change observed via satellite imagery, for 82% of Panamanian counties over 1980-1990-2000-2008. The Panamanian forest transition centered on multi-decadal in situ shifts in employment from agriculture to off-farm activity, particularly by women. Agricultural modernization and decline were coincident but of lesser importance. Urbanization entailed increasingly connected small urban centers in otherwise rural landscapes. Net forest gains per decade were similar to 1.52% of the area of influence of the socio-agrarian transformations, which concentrate in economically and agriculturally favored regions. Governments may conceivably nurture forest transitions already underway via economic policies, but they cannot coordinate them. Even so, inefficiencies may be prohibitively high, and challenges significant. A history of failure of similar 'social engineering' endeavors urges caution in this respect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This momentum springs from a confluence of practical conservation challenges and conceptual developments. In particular, the ecosystem services focus emphasizes an appreciation of the social and economic values of natural resources and ecological systems. Despite a growing interest in ecosystem services and their incorporation into public-sector decisions and transactions, a number of institutional challenges complicate these efforts. These challenges include dispersed agency authorities and jurisdictional fragmentation that may constrain the geographic scale of public-sector transactions or cross-jurisdictional planning and actions. Challenges also include limitations on agency capacities to adjust decisions in the face of changing resource conditions and new information. Nonetheless, many agencies have flexibility to incorporate ecosystem services assessments into their planning, use them to inform spending choices, and develop markets based on ecosystem services concepts. Challenges are, thus, more instrumental and practical rather than legal and structural.

Understanding dispersed patterns of urban development is important for designing policies for mitigating the environmental and other adverse effects of urban sprawl. The model includes as agents heterogeneous farmer/landowners and housing consumers, and a representative developer who buys land and builds houses. Underlying economic behavior of consumer utility maximization and developer and farmer profit maximization is assumed. A unique feature of the model is that housing is characterized by variation in both lot size and house size, allowing for exploration of the effects of changes in key parameters on both land and housing markets and the interaction between them. The paper explores the relative importance of consumer preferences, spatial distribution of agricultural productivity, and travel costs in creating sprawling development patterns. Consumer preferences for large lots do result in more land in development and lower density, but leap frog development in the model appears to be driven by other economic influences as well. And, in general, more stable housing prices mute the effect of more variable land prices and tend to dampen the effects of economic shocks to the urbanizing area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They argue that the official model of five ranked social classes is, after all, a satisfactory statistical summary of the fertility variance found among the married couples of England and Wales at the famous 1911 fertility census, and so they conclude that, pace Szreter, the official model provides a satisfactory account of the nation's fertility decline as one of social class differentials. It is acknowledged here that Barnes and Guinnane have deployed superior statistical techniques. However, it is pointed out that FCG identified fundamental problems with the design of the 1911 official model. It was a social evolutionary model privileging male professional occupations, not a modelling of recognized social class theory at the time or since. In FCG it was therefore termed the professional model'. The central historiographical claim of FCG is re-affirmed: that in order to study fruitfully the historical relationship between social class and fertility decline, an alternative approach is needed which explicitly integrates gender relations with social class.","St Johns Coll, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Szreter, S (通讯作者)，St Johns Coll, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,"Szreter, Simon/0000-0001-6903-2447",,,,,21,8,8,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

As degrowth is a critique of the dominant macroeconomic model of the endless search for economic growth, its microeconomic foundations can be built by searching a relevant grass-root economic initiative to theorise. Our approach is based upon the case study research of a self-harvesting Community Supported Agriculture in Belgium. The mainstream microeconomic model is based on the well-known Homo economicus assumption of individual self-interest and competitive behaviour. By contrast, our model is based on a holistic approach of producers and consumers, based upon trust, cooperation and ecologically responsible behaviours. This contribution participates to the flourishing literature on degrowth in Ecological Economics. We begin by reviewing the debate on degrowth and economic behaviour. We discuss the case study and its accounting expression that departs from the capitalist profit-seeking model. We conclude by explaining the limits and challenges of our model that implements degrowth on a small scale and in a capitalist environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Frameworks for valuing nature increasingly include shared/social values as a distinct category of values. However, the nature of shared/social values, as well as their relationship to other values, has not yet been clearly established and empirical evidence about the importance of shared/social values for valuation of ecosystem services is lacking. To help address these theoretical and empirical limitations, this paper outlines a framework of shared/social values across five dimensions: value concept, provider, intention, scale, and elicitation process. Along these dimensions we identify seven main, non-mutually exclusive types of shared values: transcendental, cultural/societal, communal, group, deliberated and other-regarding values, and value to society. Using a case study of a recent controversial policy on forest ownership in England, we conceptualise the dynamic interplay between shared/social and individual values. The way in which social value is assessed in neoclassical economics is discussed and critiqued, followed by consideration of the relation between shared/social values and Total Economic Value, and a review of deliberative and non-monetary methods for assessing shared/social values. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of shared/social values for decision-making. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, several countries have adopted resale-below-cost laws that ban retailers from adopting this promotion strategy. In this study, we theoretically investigate how banning below-cost pricing influences equilibrium prices, firms' profits, and consumer surplus. We explicitly consider not only horizontal competition between retailers but also vertical channel relationships between manufacturers and retailers. In addition, we focus on asymmetric competition between dominant and weak retailers, which have heterogeneous bargaining positions vis-A -vis an upstream manufacturer. We show that this ban induces the manufacturer to reduce its wholesale price and can lead to a decrease in equilibrium retail prices including that of a loss-leader product. We also show that owing to the effects of such price reductions, the ban always improves the total consumer surplus and can benefit the weak retailer in terms of bargaining position, although it always harms the manufacturer and the dominant retailer.","[Matsushima, Noriaki; Miyaoka, Akira] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan",Osaka University,"Miyaoka, A (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",nmatsush@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp; jge013ma@mail2.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Matsushima, Noriaki/D-1819-2012","Matsushima, Noriaki/0000-0002-7865-3875",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530248] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,50,0,0,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We propose kernel estimators, which includes the FE estimator as a special case. In terms of criteria based on collective conditional 'mean square error', it is demonstrated that some kernel estimators are more efficient than the FE estimators of firm effects and inefficiencies in finite sample settings. Monte Carlo simulations support our theoretical findings, and we use an empirical example to show how FE estimation and kernel estimation lead to very different conclusions about technical inefficiency among Indonesian rice farmers.","Dalarna Univ, Sch Technol & Business Studies, S-79188 Falun, Sweden",Dalarna University,"Wikström, D (通讯作者)，Dalarna Univ, Sch Technol & Business Studies, S-79188 Falun, Sweden.",dwi@du.se,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The purpose of this paper is to explore factors affecting consumers' changing consumption behaviour as regards fresh potato. Design/methodology/approach - Six semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted. Thematic analysis was made by means of a theory-driven approach. Findings - Seven categories of factors affecting consumer choice of fresh potato were found and discussed: first, convenience and preparation-related factors; second, health; third, information and packaging; fourth, sensory appeal; fifth, monetary considerations; sixth, familiarity and habit; and seventh, sustainability and ethics. Convenience appears to be the strongest explanation to changing food behaviour. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to present knowledge regarding food choice and consumers' carbohydrate intake. Findings of previous research is both validated and questioned. Methodological limitations are discussed, suggesting complementary quantitative approaches to the findings based on qualitative research. Practical implications - The findings add to knowledge of consumer behaviour and food choice. The findings may suggest focus areas in strategic marketing research, facilitating strategic decisions in response to falling consumption of fresh potatoes due to changing consumer attitudes and behaviour. Originality/value - By using a theory-driven approach in a thematic analysis, a broad set of interview data from six focus group interviews has been summarised and categorised. The methodology shows an effective way to treat a large amount of qualitative data and condense it to straightforward themes.","[Fernqvist, Fredrik; Spendrup, Sara; Ekelund, Lena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Fernqvist, F (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden.",fredrik.fernqvist@slu.se,"Fernqvist, Fredrik/B-8969-2015","Fernqvist, Fredrik/0000-0002-6534-3587",Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry; Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research,Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry; Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research,"Thanks are due to the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry, and to the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research, for financing the project.",,36,15,16,1,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This created new market income opportunities for dairy processors, but also fostered the necessity for investments to access these markets. A literature review sees cooperatives to be disadvantaged at this point, because their organisational structure hinders their access to external financial resources. Confronted with these equity constraints, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how German dairy marketing cooperatives adapted to the new business environment and have been performing from 2000 to 2012. Design/methodology/approach - An approach combining descriptive data from public sources and financial ratio analysis was used to test hypotheses, derived from Transaction Cost Theory. Findings - Contrary to assumptions, cooperatives gained market shares on the German dairy market. However, dairy cooperatives managed to overcome the internal equity constraints only partially via mergers, which intensified structural change. Focusing on cost leadership, German cooperatives were not able to successfully diversify their product portfolio and still operate mainly in the fluid, low margins dairy market segments. Frustrated by their diminishing influence on the decision making process in the vastly grown cooperatives, a majority of farmers cancelled their cooperative membership. Practical implications - Until today an absolute turning point for the cooperative organisational form has not yet occurred, but if cooperatives do not find the means to invest more heavily in the new markets, a slow decline of cooperatives is expected. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the existing literature on marketing cooperatives by providing insights on the performance of cooperatives through combination of from theory derived assumptions with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods.","[Grau, Aaron; Hockmann, Heinrich; Levkovych, Inna] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Mkt & World Agr Trade, Agr Markets, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Grau, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Mkt & World Agr Trade, Agr Markets, Halle, Saale, Germany.",grau@iamo.de,"Grau, Aaron/HMV-1764-2023; Levkvoych, Inna/AAE-2690-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,46,3,4,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected in the direct interview. The sample (n = 200) consisted of 137 women and 63 men at the age of 18-60 years. The research tool was a questionnaire divided into four sections. The first one included quality attributes. The second one included healthful properties, functional components and carriers. The third one concerned the motives for purchasing functional food and included the consequences and values. In the fourth section the participants were asked about gender, age and education. Findings - Among the quality attributes the research reveals six principal components package of information on healthful properties and nutritional value of the product, attributes of taste, health and safety, practical packaging, freshness, purity and naturalness. In terms of health benefits, two components were distinguished prevention of health problems, strengthening of the body and improvement of its functions. Among functional components, the following were distinguished vitamins and minerals, dietary fibre and Omega-3 fatty acids. As the best carriers the following were recognized: cereal products, dairy products, meat products; mixtures of fruits and vegetables. As the most important consequences motivating people to consume functional food the following were recognized: the health effects of proper nutrition resulting from consciousness raising actions promoting health; and the joy of eating and improvement of the appearance. When it comes to the most important motivating factors, good health, long harmonious life and self-esteem were included. The means to achieve these goals are to be responsible for health. Originality/value - The key factors determining the functional product and motivating for consumption of functional food may establish a basis for actions related to development and consumption of the food. The understanding of the factors that consumers take into account when choosing functional food will help in shaping the optimal strategies for product development. Learning about the basic motivating factors in consumption may be helpful in the development of healthy nutrition education and promotion programmes. The research may provide valuable support for actions related to food products promotion and marketing.","Univ Rzeszow, Dept Econ, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Rzeszow,"Kraus, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rzeszow, Dept Econ, Rzeszow, Poland.",akraus@univ.rzeszow.pl,,"Kraus, Artur/0000-0002-5425-452X",Rector of the University of Rzeszow; [DN/GrU/EK/4/2012],Rector of the University of Rzeszow;,The author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the final version of the paper.

Purchase decisions for most products are strongly linked to a person's attitude towards these products, which are determined by beliefs and meanings associated with the product. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare the perception of Bavarian food products in an international context. Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative technique of concept mapping has been used to uncover and visualise consumers' semantic networks regarding Bavarian food products. Two European countries - Bulgaria and Romania - as well as two Asian ones - China and South Korea - are exemplary selected for this study. Findings - The results clearly show that the two frequently mentioned associations across all four countries are the same while the other associations which were enumerated show a greater heterogeneity. Furthermore the study provides empirical evidence that the associations regarding Bavarian food products of the European countries are more similar to each other than the Asian ones. South Koreans have more indirect than direct associations with Bavarian food products and Chinese semantic networks regarding Bavarian food products are the least complex. These findings are underpinned by network analysis.

In particular, the study shows that sustainability could have a positive impact on brand positioning and value. The analysis is conducted by looking at the sustainability and brand equity relationship from four different angles which nevertheless offer substantial view into the subject. The first part explores role of the consumer-based brand equity concept and memory associations model in creating strong, favorable and unique brand associations. The second part examines elements of sustainability as a source of consumer-based brand equity. Part three explores impact that sustainability could have on brand knowledge and differential effect. In the fourth part the point-of-sustainability as a fifth dimension of the brand positioning model is introduced. By investigating those different angles of the relationship between sustainability and consumer-based brand equity by exploratory study, literature reviews and discussions the paper draws the picture of sustainability in the brand equity development setting. The study reveals opportunities, trends and direction in the future development of the consumer-based brand equity. More than that it shows how sustainability creates and captures the value which in turn creates demand and reduces investors' risk. The overall benefit of this paper is to provide marketers with an extra tool and power, to create and explore new ways for building strong brands. In doing so, marketers will need to dig deep into the growing set of the brand development concepts, models, theories, tools and frameworks to find sustainability related associations that will resonate with the consumers. As a result, markets will experience a proliferation of strong sustainable brands that satisfy needs of the customers under the umbrella of preserving natural resources.","[Teodorovic, Milivoj] Int Business Coll Mitrovica, Cara Dusana Bb 38228, Kosovska Mitrov, Serbia",,"Teodorovic, M (通讯作者)，Int Business Coll Mitrovica, Cara Dusana Bb 38228, Kosovska Mitrov, Serbia.",teomili0103@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,291,300,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500031,0

Based on data for seven pollutants in 29 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2010, we conducted statistical tests on the coefficients of the critical variables (polynomial income-related terms) by following the logic of a General Sensitivity Test, more often known under the name of Extreme Bound Analysis (EBA), which was initially proposed by Learner (1978). We tested a set of models (6144) and estimation methods (23) using a bootstrap approach in which each model is estimated 1001 times (1000 bootstrapped database + one original database). Based on the 6144 (*) 23 (*) 1001 regression results, we construct distributions for the coefficients of the income-related terms and calculate the cumulative probabilities for the single coefficients with the expected signs and the regressions that obtain the accepted forms of the EKC (inverted-U or N forms). Our test reveals that the EKC hypothesis cannot be considered valid for any of the seven emission indicators because the probability of obtaining a negative coefficient for the quadratic income terms and the probability of finding an inverted-U-form relationship between income and pollution are all lower than the 95% critical level. Without reaching the 95% statistical significance level for emissions such as CO2 and industrial gas, our results seem to more often reveal a positive linear relationship with income.

The contribution of this article is twofold. First, the annual effective inheritance tax rates are computed for different sizes of bequests and asset types, accounting for all relevant exemptions, deductions, and valuation discounts. Second, an attempt is made to explain changes in inheritance taxation over time. Ideology appears to be the main driver of the sharp tax increases of the 1930s to the 1960s. Wartime economies with higher pressures on the people induced politicians to raise inheritance taxes on the wealthy, primarily during the First World War. Increased opportunities for tax planning for the wealthy are also documented, most notably a series of tax cuts on inherited family firms in the 1970s. This rise in avoidance opportunities for the rich, while middle-class heirs faced growing inheritance tax rates, undermined the legitimacy of the tax and led to its repeal.","[Henrekson, Magnus; Waldenstrom, Daniel] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Waldenstrom, Daniel] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Uppsala University,"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,"We have received valuable comments from Mikael Elinder, Oscar Erixson, Kjell-Olof Feldt, Gunnar Johansson, Ken Scheve, and three anonymous referees.

This payment scheme would transition from higher monetary payments per hectare per year for the first units of land invested, to lower payments per hectare per Year for additional units of land invested; however, as payments per hectare decrease, monetary payments would be supplemented with non-financial rewards. This program structure is designed to 1) offer higher per-hectare financial incentives to smaller scale landowners, who would otherwise face steep trade-off costs by transitioning to conservation-based land-use, and 2) offer greater non-financial incentives to larger-scale landowners, who face less sharp trade-off costs, and who might be more interested in prestige- and status-based non-financial incentives than the currently meager PSA payments. I found support for the proposed program modality across all classes of landowners. Interest in PSA participation by small- and medium-scale landowners showed sensitivity to proposed payments, with landowners indicating a strong desire to participate in conservation land-use as soon as the proposed financial incentives were sufficient to cover their opportunity costs. Large-scale landowners showed little sensitivity to payment size, and in general-with mode=10 and median=7 responses on a 10 point Likert-scale-indicated strong willingness to participate in the PSA program under the proposed structure, even if financial incentives per hectare were decreased significantly for large investments of land, but prestige- and status-based awards were introduced. These results are discussed in the context of an emerging literature on signaling theory, conspicuous conservation, and the interaction of financial incentives and social norms.

This paper addresses the sustainability of the EAFRD from a triple bottom line perspective in a multiregional input-output model. This framework allows us to study both the trade relations within the EU target regions and also the relations of the EU with some other regions in the world. Additionally, the model allows us to determine the losses (leakages) or gains (boosts and feedbacks) of a wide range of effects. On the other hand, this framework allows a simultaneous consideration of socioeconomic and environmental fund effects to identify their causes and flows and to clarify and reallocate benefits and responsibilities across levels and regions. The estimation of direct and indirect impact effects in an EU country clarifies the following: a) how the leakages to other regions generate a final economic impact that redistributes the prior fund distribution; b) how relevant the countries' participation in global production chains are; and c) how the potential existence of an ecological unequal exchange is assessed.

To this point the relevant historiography has focused almost exclusively on their professional and civic role. It is the core contention of this article that the contribution of the popolani to the Venetian economy and society far exceeded their documented professional and civic function. Using as a case study the homogeneous group of the shipbuilders and sailors of Venice and drawing on newly discovered primary sources from the Venetian State Archives, this article shows the distinct contributions of the popolani to the city's economy and society through their charity to those in need. This took the form of sizeable dotal and charitable donations within and beyond the family. In one of the first attempts to explore the philanthropy of the Venetian workforce, this article challenges the existing scholarly view that charity was the sole responsibility of the government and the nobility in early modern Venice. It further shows that marriage was not merely a financial union for the popolani; it was a sanctuary for lasting companionship. Ultimately, the article offers a fresh vista onto the socio-economic role of the popolani in early modern Venice.","[Iordanou, Ioanna] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Oxford Brookes University,"Iordanou, I (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",,,,,,,,114,5,6,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Together, this information allows for the first time an evaluation of the growth performance of these important parts of the South African economy in the colonial era. The article concludes that South African performance in this period was stronger than often assumed and that by the beginning of the twentieth century European South Africans, now more fully integrated into a British World economy, operated at a level of GDP per capita that matched and in some places may have exceeded that of Australians. Non-European South Africans, however, did not share in these same advances.","[Magee, Gary B.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Magee, Gary B.; Greyling, Lorraine; Verhoef, Grietjie] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa",Monash University; University of Johannesburg,"Magee, GB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;Magee, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,University of Johannesburg Research Fund [URC244020],University of Johannesburg Research Fund,"The authors would like to thank Sisira Jayasuriya and three anonymous referees for their helpful comments, Frederich Kirsten and Edward Blight for their excellent research assistance, and the University of Johannesburg Research Fund (URC244020) for its financial support.",,62,7,8,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

J,"Nafziger, S",,,,"Nafziger, Steven",,,Communal property rights and land redistributions in Late Tsarist Russia,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RURAL CHINA; PEASANT; MARKETS; INSTITUTIONS; ECONOMY,"Communal property rights have long symbolized the apparent backwardness of rural Russian society in the late nineteenth century. Drawing on newly compiled data and qualitative sources, this article summarizes the institutions and practices of rural property rights in late Imperial Russia and shows that there was substantially more heterogeneity in what constituted peasant property rights than is commonly assumed. Archival and documentary accounts suggest that the emblematic practice of repartitioning communal land occurred relatively infrequently and, when undertaken, was generally managed in low-cost ways. Econometric evidence from Moscow province implies that repartitions were driven more by concerns over the distribution of associated tax burdens than the desire to reallocate productive assets. Along with an analysis of cross-sectional data on property rights and grain yields from European Russia, these findings suggest a weaker causal link between communal land practices and agricultural productivity than is typically asserted.","[Nafziger, Steven] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Nafziger, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,Economic History Association; Title VIII program of the US State Department,Economic History Association; Title VIII program of the US State Department,"The author thanks Dan Bogart, Leonid Borodkin, Tracy Dennison, Carol Leonard, Joel Mokyr, Farooq Naseer, and Harsha Thirumurthy for their input and aid at various stages.

In some cases, this is attributable to the private costs borne by farmers to adopt these practices, often well in advance of any benefits - public or private- that they may bring. Monetary incentives, such as through payments-for-ecosystem services (PES) programs, may be of assistance, and in this study we examine the potential for a recent innovation (the agglomeration payment) to improve adoption of pro-environmental practice in a rural agricultural context. Agglomeration payments include bonus payments for adoption by neighboring farms, which may help to encourage both compliance with the program they promote as well as the overall diffusion of the program across rural contexts. We develop an abstract agent-based model (ABM) of an agglomeration payment program to encourage adoption of the pro-environment practice of conservation agriculture (CA). We find that agglomeration payments have the potential to improve levels of adoption of pro-environmental practice per program dollar, and may help to reduce required spending on project monitoring and enforcement.

For this, we calculate which reduction targets for other major emitting economies are comparable to the EU target, given widely diverging effort-sharing approaches. We introduce a novel approach in which the EU target is taken as starting point for allocating emission reductions to other regions. Under this approach, the global emission level is an outcome of the analysis, contrary to standard effort-sharing approaches in which the global climate goal is specified. We find that the INDC of the EU, if other regions take on comparable targets based on a differentiated convergence per-capita approach, could be sufficient for a global 2 A degrees C pathway. However, if emissions are allocated according to a historical responsibility approach, the global emission level in 2030 is much higher than the level of 2 A degrees C pathways. Furthermore, we conclude that India, Mexico, and Brazil have more ambitious INDCs than the EU according to both a differentiated convergence per-capita approach and a historical responsibility approach.","[Hof, A.

This research expands the existing knowledgebase by presenting material flows for the Russian Federation and its predecessor states employing a standard accounting framework. The study of material flows for the Russian Federation provides an interesting and unique case of a planned economy and its transition to a market based form of economic organization. We show that in spite of considerable differences in the physical economy, the USSR developed material use patterns similar to that of Western industrialized economies. Lower levels of consumption were more than outweighed by inefficient production. The transition towards a market economy drove rapid improvements in resource productivity but also growth in metabolic rates. The results indicate that the transition to an industrial metabolic profile proceeds largely irrespective of economic and political conditions. An improved understanding of the evolution of socio-economic systems and the material flows that fuel them is increasingly relevant for designing new systems of production and consumption and facilitating a transition towards a more sustainable industrial metabolism, (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the future, problems will emerge with heat-uninsulated houses being partially uninhabited, as the population prefers living in heat-insulated houses and the population is likely to decrease not only in rural but also urban areas, while heating for heat-insulated houses is considerably cheaper and the lifetime of such houses after their heat-insulation (renovation) increases. Therefore, the research aim of the paper is to examine the socio-economic problems to be caused by heat-uninsulated multi-apartment houses in Latvia's regions in the future. The research found that heat-insulated houses had an implicit heating discount at the expense of heat-uninsulated houses, and the paper developed a methodology for calculating implicit discounts. In a long-term, it will contribute to their occupancy and consequently the degradation of heat-uninsulated houses. This might affect Latgale region the most, followed by Vidzeme region, while such a problem is the least specific to Pieriga region. Among cities, this problem will be the most specific to Daugavpils, followed by Rezekne; a relatively better situation might be expected in Jelgava and Jurmala.","[Ancans, Sandris] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Ancans, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",,"Ancans, Sandris/AAG-5992-2019","Ancans, Sandris/0000-0003-2773-3821",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,15,21,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700001,0

Using new firm location decisions in Iowa and North Carolina, we find that measured agglomeration economies increase the probability of new firm entry in both urban and rural areas. Firms are more likely to locate in markets with an existing cluster of firms in the same industry, with greater concentrations of upstream suppliers or downstream customers, and with a larger proportion of college-educated workers in the local labor supply. Firms are less likely to enter markets with no incumbent firms in the sector or where production is concentrated in relatively few sectors. The same factors encourage both stand-alone start-ups and establishments built by multiplant firms. Commuting decisions exhibit the same pattern as new firm entry with workers commuting from low to high agglomeration markets. Because agglomeration economies are important for rural firm entry also, policies encouraging new firm entry should focus on relatively few job centers rather than encouraging new firm entry in every small town.","[Artz, Georgeanne M.; Orazem, Peter F.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50014 USA; [Kim, Younjun] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business, Bur Business Res, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",Iowa State University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Artz, GM (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50014 USA.",gartz@iastate.edu; younjun7kim@gmail.com; pfo@iastate.edu,"Orazem, Peter/D-6525-2016","Orazem, Peter/0000-0003-2092-5089",,,,,75,48,58,4,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The use of insects as alternative protein source is claimed to be a solution to the environmental concerns over the production of animal proteins and to food security issues. Studies conducted in other European countries report that consumers are quite resistant to the introduction of insect-based products in their diet, although those who are more concerned about environmental and health show some interest towards insect consumption. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a survey with a 14-item questionnaire on 201 consumers, selected with a systematic sampling within a shopping mall. The factors influencing respondents' attitude towards insect consumption were studied by means of a logistic regression. Findings - Results show that 31 per cent of respondents were willing to try insects as food, while 5 per cent had already tried. Familiarity with foreign food, higher education and gender (male) positively influenced consumer attitude to entomophagy. Instead, the fear of insects and the idea that the taste might be disgusting were the main barriers to the willingness to try entomophagy, although these issues were mainly raised by consumers who had no direct experience with insects eating. Originality/value - The paper is a first attempt of exploring the topic of entomophagy in the Italian context. Most of the results were consistent with previous research carried out in other countries. However, some barriers to insect consumption seem to be stronger in Italy than elsewhere.","[Cicatiello, Clara; Franco, Silvio] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management, Viterbo, Italy; [De Rosa, Beatrice] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agro Food & Forest Syst, Viterbo, Italy; [Lacetera, Nicola] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci, Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University; Tuscia University; Tuscia University,"Cicatiello, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management, Viterbo, Italy.",cicatiello@unitus.it,"Lacetera, Nicola/GLV-1404-2022; Cicatiello, Clara/AAB-9685-2020; Franco, Silvio/AAA-6521-2020",,,,,,38,88,93,2,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to propose and validate a scale based on consumers' loyalty literature and on the particular features of the organic market. Design/methodology/approach - Data from 604 consumers were obtained through a web-based survey, which was used to analyze the structural equation in the AMOS software, in order to validate the proposed scale model. Findings - A one-dimensional validated scale consisting of eight questions and showing high composite reliability level (0.95) was used to measure consumer loyalty to organic food. The herein used sample presented mean True Organic Loyal (4.36) and standard deviation (0.62); these values depict Brazilians high loyalty to this food type. Research limitations/implications - The research was conducted and validated in Brazil and it can be replicated within the country as well as be transculturally validated. Originality/value - The main contribution of the current study is the development and validation of a scale named scale of consumer loyalty for organic food. The suggested interpretation ranges from non-loyal to true organic loyal consumers and it helps understanding organic food consumers' behavior. This research took under consideration consumers of any sort of organic food as well as consumers of regular food markets (farmer's markets, supermarkets, collective groups, shops and internet).","[Dias, Valeria da Veiga] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Schuster, Marcelo da Silva] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Business, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Talamini, Edson] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Econ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Revillion, Jean Philippe] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Technol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Dias, VD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",valeria-adm@hotmail.com,"Talamini, Edson/B-5523-2009","Talamini, Edson/0000-0003-2349-0447; Dias, Valeria da Veiga/0000-0001-8962-1134",,,,,59,14,16,3,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Primary data were gathered by means of focus groups and a survey-structured personal interviews by using a questionnaire. Findings - When applying conjoint and cluster analysis to data about Serbian consumers' preferences towards researched product, it is possible to identify a segment that prefers organic food the most. Compared to other segments, these consumers are predominantly female, somewhat more mature, with the highest proportion of employed and near the top by the percentage of respondents who are married and have children. They strongly value the importance of diet for health, a number of them have experience with a disease of a close person, which is believed that could be prevented by proper diet, but they do the least sports. Practical implications - The authors give managerial recommendations to actors operating at domestic organic food market.

Recently, self-employment is being enhanced both by entrepreneurs' wish to reduce labour costs and wish of employees themselves to pay less for their social insurance. In Latvia, the status of self-employed allows reducing mandatory payments for personal social insurance, and a person earning less than the state minimum salary, may choose not to make social contributions at all. The object and minimum amount of mandatory state social insurance contributions (MSSIC), making which a self-employed person may become socially insured, annually increase with the increase of minimum salary. Actually, every year more and more people with low income are left outside the security system under the regulations of the current social insurance system for self-employed persons in Latvia. This causes additional risks to the social insurance system, since part of the population is subject to the poverty risk when reaching the retirement age or becoming unable to work due to other reasons. The comparison of the state social insurance system for self-employed persons in Latvia and Lithuania allows concluding that all self-employed persons in Lithuania are subject to the mandatory state social insurance system. The authors believe that the state social insurance system of Latvia requires changes to cover also self employed persons with lower income. Besides, in Latvia, pursuant to the amendments to the law On State Social Insurance, every employee will be subject to social insurance at least for the amount of the minimum salary starting from 2017; however, no changes are planned regarding the state social insurance of self-employed persons.","[Leibus, Inguna; Irmeja, Alona] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Miceikiene, Astrida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Vytautas Magnus University,"Leibus, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",inguna.leibus@llu.lv,"LEIBUS, INGUNA/AAG-5993-2019; Irmeja, Alona/JMP-9614-2023","LEIBUS, INGUNA/0000-0002-2830-1409; Irmeja, Alona/0000-0002-1491-2874",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,305,313,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200037,0

The study shows that in Chinese colleges and universities, teaching and research are in contradiction with administrative governance. As for the lack of self-discipline mechanism, faculty members' academic misconduct and negligence in undergraduate teaching are their rational individual behavior.

Both fields address matters related to socioeconomic vulnerabilities and thus present opportunities for integration. However, many studies have stated the lack of interaction within the study areas. When dealing with CCA and SP in Brazil, the two offer an opportunity for integration since some SP programmes (such as food-based safety nets) can both affect adaptation and be impacted by expected changes in climate. Impacts from CC are projected to be extreme in the Brazilian semi-arid Northeast, a region where social programmes of assistance and aid are historically crucial during periods of drought. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to address the interaction of CCA and SP in a conceptual level on policies and programmes in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - A desk review of government documents (policies, plans, decrees) related to food security, food-based programmes and CC. Findings - Based on the results the authors highlight the limited integration between CC and SP in Brazil and the potential for interaction in many of the programmes already in place. Originality/value - The authors attribute findings to the segmented governmental structure and the weak interaction between sectors, and the only recent discussion of linkages between CC and poverty, development and food insecurity. Discussion on the challenges and benefits of this interaction are provided in a context of CC in Brazil, still not very debated in the academic literature.","[Mesquita, Patricia S.; Bursztyn, Marcel] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Mesquita, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",patriciasmesquita@gmail.com,"Bursztyn, Marcel/F-9921-2012",,Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Rede CLIMA; CNPq scholarship; CAPES scholarship; Science Without Borders scholarship,Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Rede CLIMA; CNPq scholarship(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES scholarship(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Science Without Borders scholarship,"Research supported by Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB), Rede CLIMA, and CNPq, CAPES, and Science Without Borders scholarships.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 children aged 9-11 from an after school club at a primary school in a deprived area in the West Midlands. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings - Six master themes emerged from the data: effect on the senses, feelings about food, healthy vs unhealthy foods, effects on health, convenience and family and friends. Analysis showed that children seemed to have a very good awareness of the health benefits of eating fruit and vegetables. However, negative beliefs were associated with sensory perceptions (such as taste, texture, appearance and aroma), availability, and the competing desirability of other, unhealthy foods. Also, although parents were key influences, siblings and friends were often perceived as negative influences and would tease children about eating fruit and vegetables. Practical implications - Suggestions for interventions include increasing the appeal and availability of pre-prepared fruits and vegetables in both home and school environments. Additionally, an approach to eating more fruit and vegetables which focusses on siblings and friends is advocated as these groups appear to play a key role in terms of promoting the consumption of these foods. Originality/value - This study is novel as it uses individual interviews to explore primary school children's attitudes towards fruit and vegetable consumption in a deprived area in England. By focussing on the specific behaviours of fruit and vegetable consumption, the findings aid the development of interventions that are designed to improve children's healthy eating behaviour.","[Povey, Rachel; Cowap, Lisa] Staffordshire Univ, Ctr Hlth Psychol, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England; [Gratton, Lucy] Staffordshire Cty Council, Staffordshire Publ Hlth, Stafford, England",Staffordshire University,"Povey, R (通讯作者)，Staffordshire Univ, Ctr Hlth Psychol, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England.",r.povey@staffs.ac.uk,,"Povey, Rachel/0000-0003-2092-7498; Cowap, Lisa/0000-0002-8876-0260",,,,,37,14,14,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of these studies was to determine how the local developers comprehend the strategy of the design process, what kind of problems they might encounter as well as the ways and situations in which the experts could aid them in this process. This was accomplished using the multiple case study method, which is suitable for (1) describing the methodology used in the development of strategies and (2) uncovering the problems and opportunities that experts and NGOs may face during the strategy development. The main aims were to discover how the local developers (NGOs) understand the strategical planning concept, how they develop a methodology and implement it as well as the obstacles and opportunities that occur in the strategy design process, including in the cooperation of the local activity groups and the expert group from the university. It became clear that there was no common methodology for creating development strategies in Estonia. The local activity groups required cooperation with the experts from the very first steps in the design process. The appropriate procedure and methodology should be developed before the design process begins.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate individual WTP for enriched mozzarella cheese and related it to self-efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations of omega-3 consumption, following regulatory focus theory. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in May-June 2015 from a sample of 150 consumers in Southern Italy. A structural equation modelling procedure was implemented. Findings - The results show a significant role is played by prevention outcome expectations on consumer behaviour. While promotion outcome expectation constructs proved non-significant, self-identity correlates with prevention outcome expectations. Research limitations/implications - There are several limitations that the authors are aware of regarding this study. First of all, since the authors rely on self-reported measures, optimistic bias might have affected participants' responses (Weinstein, 1980). Second, results may be influenced by the choice of the specific information provided to consumers for the analysis; different claims and different information framings should be tested (LeBoeuf and Shafir, 2003). Practical implications - Implications stemming from the results encourage the promotion of omega-3 enriched mozzarella cheese based on stimulating outcome expectations, bearing in mind that individual motivations should be enhanced by self-identity beliefs. Originality/value - Although the combined role of self-efficacy and outcome expectations on personal intention to adopt healthy behaviour has already been demonstrated (Keller, 2006; Tudoran et al., 2012), to the best of the knowledge no previous study relates individual behaviour to an intention measured as a WTP for an actual product. In addition, current study has applied a non-hypothetical BDM (from Becker et al., 1964) auction in-store experiment.","[Vecchio, Riccardo; Lombardi, Alessia; Cembalo, Luigi; Caracciolo, Francesco; Cicia, Gianni; Masucci, Felicia; Di Francia, Antonio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Cembalo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy.",cembalo@unina.it,"Vecchio, Riccardo/I-8357-2012; Cicia, Gianni/B-1822-2012; Masucci, Felicia/Q-4398-2019; Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013","Vecchio, Riccardo/0000-0003-2790-597X; Masucci, Felicia/0000-0003-2382-0354; Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Lombardi, Alessia/0000-0002-5862-0283; Cicia, Gianni/0000-0003-4188-241X; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797; DI FRANCIA, Antonio/0000-0002-2859-8038",,,,,71,19,20,3,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We combined this treatment with an in-group (groups from a single community)/mixed group (groups composed of fishers from different communities) treatment. Our aim is to compare the effects of social disapproval in a context in which individuals exploiting a CPR belong to different communities relative to the case in which only individuals from the same community are allowed to exploit the resource. We find that mixed groups unlike in-groups reduce their exploitation of the resource in response to the threat of punishment. We do not find any differences in behavior between in-groups and mixed groups when the possibility of being punished is not available. Both in in-groups and mixed groups there is substantial antisocial punishment, which leads to increased extraction of the CPR by those who are unfairly punished. We interpret that the effectiveness of social disapproval is reduced because cooperation was not perceived as the unique social norm. These findings indicate that effective peer punishment requires coordination to prevent antisocial targeting and to clarify the social signal conveyed by punishment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that the 1976 coffee boom changed the interaction between sectors from an assurance to a prisoner's dilemma game, and identifies as the post-boom solution the Government-Coffee coalition, which carried out a soft version of the initial reforms.","[Rojas Rivera, Angela M.] Univ Antioquia, Dept Econ, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia,"Rivera, AMR (通讯作者)，Univ Antioquia, Dept Econ, Ciudad Univ,Calle 67 53-108,Bloque 13,Oficina 413, Medellin, Colombia.",amilena.rojas@udea.edu.co,,,Vicerrectoria de Docencia of the Universidad de Antioquia,Vicerrectoria de Docencia of the Universidad de Antioquia,"Received 29 July 2014.

Using projections at the horizon 2040, different management strategies and scenarios are compared from a viability viewpoint, thus accounting for biodiversity preservation, fleet profitability and food security.

This resulted in a cap-and-trade approach which aims to mitigate the adverse effects on development through appropriate transfers to achieve fair burden sharing. However, the continuation of this paradigm cannot untie the development-climate Gordian knot. (The Gordian Knot refers to a seemingly intractable problem. According to a Greek legend, Gordios arrived in Phrygia in an ox cart, was made King and dedicated his cart to Zeus, tying it up with an intricate knot. The person who would untie the knot would rule Asia. Alexander the Great found a solution by cutting it with his sword. Hourcade et al. (The design of climate policy. MIT Press, Cambridge, p 408, 2008) explain that, after Rio Earth Summit (1992), the climate negotiations remained disengaged from the debates on development pathways, thus tying up a new Gordian knot of misunderstandings.) Instead one loses sight of the benefits of cooperation in a global agreement to abate GHGs emissions. The challenge is now to align the development and climate objectives taking into consideration the changing context since the 1990s which includes a re-equilibrium of the world economic balance and the adverse context created by the 2008 financial crisis. This paper proposes that carbon finance should be considered as part of a general reform of the financial system. The adoption of a carbon value as a notional price could trigger a wave of low-carbon investments in the world thereby redirecting some global savings towards low-carbon investments, thus providing a lever for equitable access to development.","[Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Cassen, Christophe] Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Cassen, Christophe] CNRS, Delegat Paris Michel Ange, F-75794 Paris 16, France; [Shukla, P. -R.] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Universite Paris Saclay; CIRAD; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Cassen, C (通讯作者)，Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, 45bis Ave La Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",cassen@centre-cired.fr,,"Shukla, Priyadarshi/0000-0002-7305-2907",Chair 'Modeling for sustainable development',Chair 'Modeling for sustainable development',The authors acknowledge funding by the Chair 'Modeling for sustainable development' (led by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and Mines ParisTech).,,52,9,9,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We first examine the possibility of using a non-monetary numeraire to estimate household willingness-to-pay for watershed services. Survey results indicate that while some 50% of the population is willing to pay in monetary terms for environmental services, this number increases to 72% when asked to contribute in labor time. Social benefits from environmental services are 1.4 to 2.2 times higher in labor hours relative to benefits estimated in monetary terms. Our findings suggest that cash constrained rural households in developing countries are more likely to express their demand for local environmental services by offering their time, rather than making a monetary payment. Our results also suggest that locational differences matter. Downstream community members, who practice commercial vegetable farming, have a higher demand for watershed services and are willing to pay a third more than upstream farmers for these services.

Whether these aims can be achieved to the desired extent depends, among other things, on the presence of rebound effects. This article estimates economy-wide rebound effects for non-energetic raw materials in the context of a set of material efficiency projects carried out in Germany. Under the assumption that the efficiency technologies developed in these projects are scaled up to the national level, input-output analysis is used to calculate changed material requirements and corresponding rebound effects. Reduced material flows in monetary terms, together with economic data, are aggregated to an economy-wide impulse, which can cause re-increases in the demand for the considered raw materials. Depending on the project-specific framework conditions and subject to the modeling assumptions, our estimates suggest that individual materials display a wide range of rebound effects, ranging from close to zero to low double digit percentages. These results point towards the conclusion that economy-wide rebound effects do not make these efficiency measures obsolete. However, they also suggest that rebound effects should not be ignored in the assessment of the role of efficiency in future resource consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

That is why the German national sustainability strategy highlights water as one of the priority fields of action. In Germany, WSC show characteristics of natural monopoly. The distinct separation between public institutions and the private sector as well as municipal operators being responsible for practicing special functions is characteristic for the German water economy. From an evolutionary perspective it is of interest how German WSC implement sustainability strategically. Therefore, strategic concepts and tools facing sustainability (e.g. ISO 14001, Reporting, and Balanced Scorecard etc.) were analysed and evaluated in the context of the water industry. Using literature studies and web analysis the relevant data of 110 German WSC was put together. A cross-sectional design was used in order to find patterns. Possible gaps are highlighted and ongoing steps to foster sustainability are stressed. This study points out a sustainable management is just marginally implemented. The results obviously show that there are differences between large companies and SMEs facing sustainability requirements. WSC having own regenerative power generation and an integrative thinking of farming and water supply, are part of good practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research suggests that some low cost environmentally-friendly behaviors are stigmatized, but has not accounted for the impact of contextual information on perceived status. Here, we use costly signaling theory to describe why consumption-reducing behaviors may be associated with low status and when and how this perception might change. We report two empirical studies in the U.S. that use a large sample of graduate students (N = 447) to examine the effects of contextual information on how consumption-reducing behaviors are perceived. We then explore the perceived appropriateness of consumption-reducing behavior for signaling status relative to alternative non-environmental behaviors. Using linear mixed-effects models, we find that information indicating that consumption-reducing behavior is a choice results in higher perceived status. However, we find that consumption-reducing behaviors are perceived to be less appropriate for conveying status than consumption-intensive behaviors. The environmental orientation of the respondent has little effect on perceptions of status in both studies. These results provide insights into the dynamic, evolutionary process by which sustainable consumption might become more socially acceptable and the social factors that may inhibit this process.

Farmers may be able to increase the provision of natural pest control by working together. However, little is known about US farmers' willingness to cooperate to control pests. In this study, we survey 229 Missouri crop farmers to explore farmers' willingness to cooperate. We find that 91% say they are willing to cooperate to control pests, and that simple, local cooperative efforts may be more popular than formal, county-wide efforts. In addition, the determinants that affect willingness to cooperate follow those predicted by the collective action, agricultural adoption, and ecosystem management literatures. Specifically, farmers who believe that they will receive a net benefit, have farms similar to their neighbors', are active members of a community organization, have positive contact with agricultural extension agents, and are concerned about the effect that pesticides may have on the environment are more willing to cooperate than farmers who do not share these characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the conditions that may foster cooperation between farmers in the provision of an ecosystem service. Plus, it may help facilitate the formation of pest control cooperatives in the United States. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we first design a composite food security index which enables us to distinguish households depending on their level of food security (low, intermediate, high). Then, we estimate a partial proportional odds logistic model in order to evaluate the main determinants leading to a switch from one level of food security to the other. We show that inter-annual and seasonal rainfall variability have a negative impact on food security. This is especially true in southern Mali, although agro-ecological conditions in this region are usually more favorable. As for remittances, their impact is positive, though it needs to be qualified: they enable households to solve temporary food security situations, but they have no effect on structural food security issues.

Estimates of the SCC can be used by policy makers to evaluate climate change policies and greenhouse gas emission reduction projects by means of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). Such analyses are complicated by the wide range of SCC values that have been reported in the literature, and the large uncertainties involved in estimating the potential economic impacts and related Costs of climate change. This study presents a critical review of the reported SCC estimates by examining some neglected consequences of climate change, uncertain and extreme scenarios of climate change, the discounting of future climate change effects, the treatment of individual risk aversion, and assumptions about social welfare. In view of the many uncertainties and omissions in conventional cost-benefit analyses of climate impacts and the SCC, alternative approaches to decision-making should be considered for climate policy.

This article examines the links between formal workforce participation and access to resources for individualized discretionary spending in British working-class households during the late 1930s, via an analysis of household leisure expenditures. Leisure spending is particularly salient to intra-household resource allocation, as it constitutes one of the most highly prioritized areas of individualized expenditure, especially for young, single people. Using a database compiled from surviving returns to the Ministry of Labour's national 1937/8 working-class expenditure survey, we examine leisure participation rates for over 600 households, using a detailed set of commercial leisure activities together with other relevant variables. We find that the employment status of family members other than the male breadwinner was a key factor influencing their access to commercial leisure. Our analysis thus supports the view that the breadwinner-homemaker household was characterized by strong power imbalances that concentrated resourcesespecially for individualized expendituresin the hands of those family members who engaged in paid labour.","[Scott, Peter; Walker, James T.; Miskell, Peter] Univ Reading, Int Business & Strategy, Ctr Int Business Hist, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Scott, P (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Int Business & Strategy, Ctr Int Business Hist, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,,"Walker, James/0000-0002-3477-0236; Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040; Miskell, Peter/0000-0003-2699-6152",Nuffield Foundation [H502620],Nuffield Foundation,"We thank Nat Ishino, Fatima Cardias Williams, and Natalie Anderson for excellent research assistance.

Combined heat and power (CHP) offers a promising technological approach to achieving both goals. While a recent US. executive order set a national goal of 40 GW of new industrial CHP by 2020, the deployment of CHP is challenged by financial, regulatory, and workforce barriers. Discrepancies between private and public interests can be minimized by policies promoting energy-based economic development. In this context, a great deal of rhetoric has addressed the ambiguous goal of growing green jobs. Our research provides a systematic evaluation of the job impacts of an investment tax credit that would subsidize industrial CHP deployment. We introduce a hybrid analysis approach combining simulations using the National Energy Modeling System with Input-output modeling. NEMS simulates general-equilibrium effects including supply- and demand-side resources. We identify first-order employment impacts by creating bill of goods expenditures for the installation and operation of industrial CHP systems. Second-order impacts are then estimated based on the redirection of energy-bill savings accruing to consumers; these include jobs across the economy created by the lower electricity prices that would result from increased reliance on energy-efficient CHP systems. On a jobs-per-GWh basis, we find that the second-order impacts are approximately twice as large as the first-order impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A regression function is estimated via kernel methods without functional form assumptions. To guarantee that the estimated input distance function satisfies its properties, monotonicity constraints are imposed on the regression surface via the constraint weighted bootstrapping method borrowed from statistics literature. The first, second, and cross partial analytical derivatives of the estimated input distance function are derived, and thus the elasticities measuring input substitutability can be computed from them. The method is then applied to a cross-section of 3,249 Norwegian timber producers.","Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Sun, K (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",k.sun@aston.ac.uk,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439",,,,,32,8,9,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the types of actors in the multilevel transnational food chain regulatory governance and how their interlinking affects regulatory outcomes over time. Design/methodology/approach - Food chain regulatory standards emerge within a complex process beyond the state. Based on interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives, namely regulatory governance and political economy, this paper provides a integrative framework of analysis by identifying the types of actors and their interactions in the food chain regulatory governance. Findings - Food chain regulatory standards setting have been mainly studied either from the public regulator or the firm self-regulating point of view. This paper demonstrates how the political and economics dynamics of the interactions among public and private actors operate within the transnational food standards setting process. The study identifies the groups of interdependent actors ( public and private) that interact within the transnational food chain regulatory process and develop public-private regulations, self-regulations, and co-regulations over time. In this process, the actors' different power, operational and regulatory capacity, experience, resources affect the regulatory outcome with socio-economic and governance implications. Research limitations/implications - The paper does not examine in detail how these interactions operate empirically on specific regulations. Practical implications - The paper offers an integrative thorough understanding of the food chain regulatory standard setting process, relevant for academics, policy makers, the industry, and society. Originality/value - The paper constitutes new research by identifying the actors and interactions in the integrative regulatory governance of the food chain standards.","[Chatzopoulou, Sevasti] Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalizat, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Chatzopoulou, S (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Dept Soc & Globalizat, Roskilde, Denmark.",seva@ruc.dk,"Chatzopoulou, Sevasti/B-4470-2014","Chatzopoulou, Sevasti/0000-0002-7366-9181",,,,,56,6,6,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of two focus group sessions, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to a representative sample of 2,147 Norwegian households via e-mail. Findings - Results showed that the Norwegian public is concerned about fish welfare and is willing to pay a price premium for products made from welfare-assured fish. Norwegian consumers do not, however, want to be the only ones paying for fish welfare, as the main responsibility for fish welfare lies with producers and the Government. Research limitations/implications - In this study willingness to pay is measured using a hypothetical choice experiment. Values people express as citizens, however, may not accurately predict true consumer behaviour. This is generally referred to as citizen-consumer duality and may have affected the results. Practical implications - The study shows that there is a national market for welfare-assured fish products, but education initiatives focusing on fish farming and fish welfare issues would further influence the attitudes and purchasing habits of Norwegian consumers. Originality/value - Although concern about animal welfare is growing in the western world, very little attention has been given to the welfare of fish. This paper aims to make up for this by presenting a study of how Norwegians view the welfare of farmed salmon.","[Ellingsen, Kristian; Mejdell, Cecilie] Norwegian Vet Inst, Dept Hlth Surveillance, Oslo, Norway; [Grimsrud, Kristine] Stat Norway, Grp Energy & Environm Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Nielsen, Hanne Marie; Olesen, Ingrid] Nofima, Dept Breeding & Genet, As, Norway; [Honkanen, Pirjo] Nofima, Dept Consumer & Mkt Res, Tromso, Norway; [Navrud, Stale] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Gamborg, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sandoe, Peter] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ Large Anim Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",Norwegian Veterinary Institute; Statistics Norway; Nofima; Nofima; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Ellingsen, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Vet Inst, Dept Hlth Surveillance, Oslo, Norway.",Kristian.Ellingsen@vetinst.no,"Grimsrud, Kristine Malmkvist/G-5582-2019; Olesen, Ingrid/C-7106-2012; Gamborg, Christian/AAC-2075-2019; Marie, Mejdell Cecilie/K-2171-2012; Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015","Grimsrud, Kristine Malmkvist/0000-0002-6580-1031; Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280; Mejdell, Cecilie Marie/0000-0002-1260-8502; Navrud, Stale/0000-0002-6627-4595; Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273; Ellingsen-Dalskau, Kristian/0000-0003-1290-2485",Research Council of Norway [190457/S40],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The authors thank Ann-Charlotte Karlsson for help with conducting the focus group studies, Morten Raun Morkbak for useful advice concerning the discussion of hypothetical bias when interpreting WTP and an anonymous referee for useful comments.

In this research, Health and Taste Attitude Scales (HTAS) developed by Roininen et al. in 1999 for measuring health and taste attitudes of consumers, were applied in Serbia. The purpose of this paper is to find out whether the same sub-scales can be identified as in HTAS applications abroad, to test the predictive validity of HTAS and to investigate respondents' health and taste attitudes in the context of their socio-demographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were gathered by means of focus groups and a survey - structured personal interviews by using a questionnaire. The research was conducted in July 2013 with 300 respondents participating. Findings - The same sub-scales were identified in Serbian consumer research as in HTAS applications abroad. Generally, all the Health sub-scales are useful predictors of consumption of several types of food perceived as healthy, while the Taste sub-scales (except Pleasure) are good predictors of consumption of both, food considered as tasty and food considered as not tasty. Out of socio- demographic variables, only age showed statistically significant correlations to some of the Taste sub-scales. Practical implications - Several recommendations for companies operating on the domestic food market were given in this paper. Originality/value - The first application of HTAS in Serbia, generally characterized by scarce food consumer research, was shown in this paper. It is also the first application of HTAS in a Southern European country.","[Grubor, Aleksandar; Djokic, Nenad; Djokic, Ines; Kovac-Znidersic, Ruzica] Univ Novi Sad, Dept Trade Mkt & Logist, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Djokic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Dept Trade Mkt & Logist, Subotica, Serbia.",mines@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Grubor, Aleksandar/AAM-4219-2020; Djokic, Nenad/HIK-2985-2022","Grubor, Aleksandar/0000-0001-9798-0401; Djokic, Nenad/0000-0001-8229-8354",,,,,54,11,12,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Particular attention was given to information search strategies employed by young adult wine consumers. Design/methodology/approach - A web-based survey was carried out on 287 young urban wine consumers who were recruited in specialised wine shops and at wine festivals. The key variables presenting the consumers' wine searches were measured using the best-worst scaling method. Latent class cluster analysis (LCA) was used to segment the respondents into clusters based on their level of SK of wine. Findings - The study identifies three consumer segments with corresponding levels of SK related to wine. The segments present considerable differences in the wine-consumption-related behaviours and information search strategies. Research limitations/implications - Understanding young adults' SK of wine will assist wine marketers in their efforts to establish marketing strategies for this generational cohort. In addition, research (preferably transnational) is recommended to validate the conclusions and to gain additional understanding of SK as an indicator of wine-related behaviours. Originality/value - This study contributes to a better understanding of the wine-purchasing behaviours of young adults with particular focus on SK related to wine. The results obtained may be applied by winemakers in the development of marketing and promotion strategies geared towards the promising young adult consumer segment.","[Hristov, Hristo; Kuhar, Ales] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Hristov, H (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",hristovhristo@outlook.com,"Hristov, Hristo/AAA-4044-2020","Hristov, Hristo/0000-0002-5088-9747",,,,,54,15,16,6,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how much asymmetry Flemish farmers perceive in their relationships for innovation with colleagues, suppliers and buyers. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 86 farmers active in four different agricultural subsectors in Flanders were consulted, of which 38 via in-depth interviews and 48 in seven focus groups. Data were analysed using NVivo. Findings - The authors found that across subsectors, different players in innovation networks play different roles. Furthermore, the authors observed that the majority of farmers see their relationships more as a necessity for the farm to be able to function, than as an opportunity for innovation. If they collaborate for innovation, they often prefer symmetric relationships with similar companies on horizontal level. Vertical collaboration for innovation is not very popular in the sample. Practical implications - The findings suggest that farmers should take more actions to gain power in the chain and improve their skills with regards to negotiating with their suppliers or buyers. Furthermore, the authors found which characteristics of asymmetric relationships would foster the development of innovation processes. Originality/value - Empirical work studying the effects and impacts of asymmetric relationships for innovation from the SME's perspective are still limited, especially in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, this sector is of practical relevance to study because the need for networking and innovation is very real.","[Lambrecht, Evelien; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuhne, Bianka] Univ Ghent, Fac Bioengn, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Lambrecht, E (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",evelien.lambrecht@ugent.be,,"Kuhne, Bianka/0000-0002-5597-2320",,,,,68,5,6,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Therefore, a more positive outcome for women advancing to senior roles of management or leadership may be observed in the future. The first female executives, because they were breaking new ground, adhered to many of the, rules of conduct that spelled success for men. Modern tourism organizations understand that faster and enhanced inclusion of women in management structures helps them gain the necessary diversity of leadership styles and approaches to management. This is of high significance to modern tourism organizations if they wish to survive, grow and develop. The aim of this paper was to present some overall structural indicators of the gender inequality evidenced in the field of Croatian tourism. The objective is to determine specific personal and professional characteristics of women in managerial positions in Croatian tourism organisations and the differences relating to the same characteristics in men. The working hypothesis was that a female manager is increasingly aware of her position in society, her chances and qualities, and therefore asks for the relevant acknowledgements as well. The sample of fifty (N=50) leading female managers in Croatian tourism organizations took part in online survey. The findings indicated that women tend to use the supporting management style. Over one fifth of the leading female managers in Croatian tourism point out that insufficient authority and ambition are the main obstacles to advancement of women to leadership positions. The biggest difference between male and female management styles is reflected in the following spheres: intimate-detached, indulgent-inflexible, solo player-team player, modest-always wants more, avoids the risk-accepts the risk.","[Perkov, Davor] DIU Libertas Int Univ, Trg JF Kennedyja 6b, Zagreb, Croatia; [Primorac, Dinko] Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Perkov, Matej] Perkov Savjetovanje Doo, Trsje 15, Zagreb, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Perkov, D (通讯作者)，DIU Libertas Int Univ, Trg JF Kennedyja 6b, Zagreb, Croatia.",dperkov@libertas.hr; dinko.primorac@unin.hr; matejperkov@hotmail.com,"Primorac, Dinko/IVH-5297-2023; Primorac, Dinko/AFQ-8288-2022",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,104,114,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500012,0

Societally relevant research on and for sustainability transitions therefore has to produce systems, target, as well as transformative knowledge. The challenges of sustainability transitions require furthermore that the individual and the societal levels have to be linked as to relate individual agency and structural change within the different knowledge types. Taking transition management as a rather obvious starting point to enrich the concept of sustainability transitions, the paper elaborates that its conceptual basis is too thin to address the first two types of knowledge. In its current elaborations, transition management does furthermore not cover individual agency as potential driver of transitions. We therefore suggest complementing transition management approaches with the more descriptive practice theory and the more normative and individualistic capability approach. We suggest a heuristic combination that places individuals back into the study of sustainability transitions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper first applies Multiple Correspondence Analysis to separate the modalities of variables and households according to their features, with health knowledge and time constraint of a spouse highlighted. Then, the transcribed principal information of both variables and households has been added into Marshallian demand function with fish price, income, child effect, and health status for identification of factors on household fish demand. The robust fixed effect and robust random effect GLS regression has been conducted. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about what and how factors affect household fish consumption. It suggests that, for all households, pork is still a main substitution of fish, fish consumption regarding to each household should be constant, and fish consumption differs a lot between provinces. For households with higher dietary knowledge, the authors found that increase of income, the existence of adolescent would cause an increase in fish consumption, while illness of household member makes a decrease in fish consumption. For households with working women who have higher opportunity cost of time pursue much more convenience, then consume less fish at home than their counterparts. Research limitations/implications - The increasing variety in consumer's dietary need makes the understanding of which becoming much more difficult than before. This paper uses three-wave panel data with households spread over nine provinces in China, but the results still has its limitation since china is the one with vast in territory and residents. In the future, the difference between urban and rural area in fish consumption need further research. Practical implications - The paper reveals the common determinants of fish consumption in China, and makes a further clear answer by a further discussion on different household types. The results have rather high implications for making targeted policy or precisely forecasting a future fish demand in China, which will rather be helpful for fishery industry development in China. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study the divergence of determinants or the impact degree of different factors on fish consumption in China by household types. An increasing trend of food away from home has significant effect on how to count household size in food consumption studies, and the identification of persday in this study shows its advantages in dealing with this issue, which makes a contribution on resolve the overestimation of household size issue.","[Zhou, Lin; Cheng, Guangyan; Wang, Dongyang] Minist Agr, Inst Food & Nutr Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shaosheng] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Nutr & Food Safety, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Qiyan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Zhejiang University; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Renmin University of China,"Wang, DY (通讯作者)，Minist Agr, Inst Food & Nutr Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoulin620@gmail.com,,"Zeng, Qiyan/0000-0002-8598-447X","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center [5 R24 HD050924]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center, NIH; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; National Natural Science Foundation of China [NNSFC-71273233, 71333011]; Collaborative Innovation Center for Rural Reform and Development, Zhejiang University","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Collaborative Innovation Center for Rural Reform and Development, Zhejiang University","This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

Does service FDI locate differently to manufacturing FDI? A regional analysis for Great Britain, Regional Studies. This paper analyses the location of foreign direct investment (FDI) in services at the NUTS-2 region level for Great Britain over 1996-2005, covering the period of growth in FDI. It finds strong differences in service FDI location compared with manufacturing FDI. Unlike manufacturing, service FDI location is determined at no higher than the NUTS-2 region level, while it is more dynamic and converging to the larger markets. A similar pattern is found for the services that are most forward-linked to manufacturing industries. The paper concludes that access to final consumer demand is important for service FDI, with implications for UK regional policy.","[Jones, Jonathan; Wren, Colin] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Jones, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",jonathan.jones@ncl.ac.uk,,"Jones, Jonathan/0000-0003-3619-0777",Newcastle University and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Spatial Economic Research Centre,Newcastle University and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Spatial Economic Research Centre,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Newcastle University and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Spatial Economic Research Centre (http://www.spatialeconomics.ac.uk).,,42,13,14,5,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This study explores an original way to benefit from thorium with pressurized water reactors (PWR). It relies on a versatile reactor EPR (TM) core concept which well circumscribes thorium fuel reprocessing and re-fabrication Fleets representative of what can be deployed at the scale of a small country were simulated using the scenario software COSI6. The cornerstone of this study is here the possibility to multi-recycle plutonium into Pu/Th fuel as plutonium degradation is softened by mixing it with high-grade fissile matters. Plutonium content inside Pu/Th fuel remains then far below the limit existing in PWR for safety reasons. This synergistic effect between U/Pu and U/Th cycles enables a better valorization of fissile elements present in spent fuels. Improved plutonium management makes possible to stabilize spent fuel stocks and the plutonium inventory at the cycle back-end. Thanks to multi-recycling allowed by the U/Pu/Th studied scheme, uranium resource savings exceed 25%. Minor actinides production is also reduced even though production of curium alone increases. These results reveal that thorium introduction in standard PWR may be a sustainable middle-term option, assuming that U/Pu/Th fuel reprocessing and re-fabrication would become available.","[Martin, G.; Girieud, R.] CEA DEN DER SPRC LECy, Bat 230, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France",,"Martin, G (通讯作者)，CEA DEN DER SPRC LECy, Bat 230, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France.",guillaume.martin@cea.fr,,,AREVA,AREVA,"The authors are grateful to AREVA for its support to this work through the ACF research program.

This paper outlines a critical political economy perspective on coal and a flagship 'market mechanism' for emissions reduction. The prospects for an effective emissions trading scheme in coal dominated economies are considered in light of its theoretical justifications as well as recent attempts to price carbon in Australia. Emissions trading is a weak instrument that does not address real-world failures of coal governance. At their theoretical best, carbon prices produce marginal changes to the cost structure of production. In practice, the Australian case demonstrates emissions trading is an attempt to displace the emissions reduction task away from coal, through compensation arrangements and offsetting. In light of the urgent need to rapidly reduce global emissions, direct regulation and democratisation of coal production and consumption should be flagship climate policy.

Previous studies over the decades leading up to the new millennium show human capital divergence across cities, where the share of college graduates grew faster in cities that had larger initial shares of college-educated workers. However, labour markets have changed significantly post-2000, likely affecting migration decisions of highly-skilled workers. Additionally, past studies have not controlled for important changes in industry education levels and overall industry composition that may influence city-level college graduate growth. We use detailed 4-digit NAICS industry employment data combined with public micro-data to construct measures of industry skill upgrading and changes in industry composition to control for their effects on human capital growth. We find agglomeration forces, rather than initial graduate share, explains college-graduate share growth post-2000. We also decompose graduates into bachelors and postgraduate degree holders to determine whether different forces are at play on growth of graduates at different education levels.","[Betz, Michael R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, PAES Bldg,First Floor 305 W 17th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, AED Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fallah, Belal] Palestine Polytech Univ, Coll Adm Sci & Informat, Hebron, West Bank, Israel",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Palestine Polytechnic University,"Betz, MR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, PAES Bldg,First Floor 305 W 17th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",betz.40@osu.edu; partridge.27@osu.edu; bfallah2000@yahoo.com,"Betz, Michael/I-5430-2013",,Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES),Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES),"The funding for the acquisition of the EMSI data used in this study partially came from the Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES) through a grant received by Partridge.

Deep Ocean Water (DOW) is a resource that can provide electricity (through OTEC in combination with warm surface water), low temperatures for refrigeration, and nutrients for food production. In this paper we propose an Ocean Technology Ecopark (OTEP) as an integral solution for small islands that consists of an OTEC plant, other alternative uses of DOW, and a Research and Development (R&D) center. We present an application of OTEP to San Andres, a Colombian island that meets all the necessary conditions for the implementation of OTEC technology, water desalinization, and a business model for DOW.

An evolutionary program optimises the mix of technologies in 100% renewable energy portfolios (RE) in the Australian National Electricity Market. Various technologies are reduced in availability to determine their relative importance for achieving low costs. The single most important factor is found to be the integration of large quantities of wind; therefore wind integration is identified as a research priority. In contrast, photovoltaics are found to saturate the system at less than 10% of total energy (in the absence of storage or demand management, installation of further photovoltaics does not contribute significant further value). This indicates that policies to promote utility-scale photovoltaics should be considered in partnership with complementary measures (such as demand side participation and storage). Biofuelled gas turbines are found to be important; a complete absence of bioenergy increases costs by AU$20-30/MWh, and even having only 0.1 TWh per year of bioenergy available reduces average costs by AU$3-4/MWh. Limits on the non-synchronous penetration (NSP) are found to be relatively expensive, suggesting a significant research priority around finding alternative approaches to providing synchronous services, such as inertia. Geothermal and concentrating solar thermal technologies do not appear essential as long as sufficient wind and peaking bioenergy is available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilities are likely to own the majority of renewable energy assets in SIDS and will therefore be the initial custodians of any cost savings renewable energy provides. This raises a key policy question: to what extent should SIDS utilities pass on these savings to consumers by lowering electricity rates?

Our simulation results also provide insight into how much the local economy has lost due to inadequate electricity supply in the period leading up to the construction of Medupi and Kusile. We find that the decision to build additional power generation capacity was necessary and justified, and that the failure to sooner recognise the need for expansion of the country's electricity generation capacity and subsequent delays in commissioning Medupi and Kusile, likely cost the economy over R110bn in lost production. Additional analysis, in which a further two-year delay in the construction of Medupi and Kusile is simulated, shows that such an event will cause the economy to perform below baseline projections up to 2022.

Then, the combination of Tapio decoupling indicator and generalized LMDI method is utilized to study what the decoupling status occurred in Liaoning Province and why the decoupling status appeared. During the study period, only four decoupling status occurred: expansive negative decoupling, expansive coupling, weak decoupling, and strong decoupling. The energy intensity decoupling effect played a positive role in the appearance of decoupling.

The aim of this work is to quantify the extent to which the rapid spread of biogas raised the maize price at regional level, increasing the demand of land for energy crops. For this purpose we applied a partial-equilibrium framework simulating the agricultural sector and the biogas industry in Lombardy, under two alternative schemes of subsidization policy. Results show that policy measures implemented in 2013 - reducing the average subsidy per kWh - may contribute to enforce the complementarity of the sector with agri-food chains, decreasing the competition between energy and non-energy uses. Compared to the old scheme, maize demand for biogas would decrease, lessening the market clearing price (as well as feed opportunity cost for livestock sector) and reducing land demand for energy purposes.

Chinese government has realized the importance of energy conservation and prevention of the climate changes for sustainable development of China's economy and set targets for CO2 emissions reduction in China. In China industry contributes 84.2% of the total CO2 emissions, especially manufacturing industries. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist productivity (MP) index are the widely used mathematical techniques to address the relative efficiency and productivity of a group of homogenous decision making units, e.g. industries or countries. However, in many real applications, especially those related to energy efficiency, there are often undesirable outputs, e.g. the pollutions, waste and CO2 emissions, which are produced inevitably with desirable outputs in the production. This paper introduces a novel Malmquist Luenberger productivity (MLP) index based on directional distance function (DDF) to address the issue of productivity evolution of DMUs in the presence of undesirable outputs. The new RAM (Range-adjusted measure)-based global MLP index has been applied to evaluate CO2 emissions reduction in Chinese light manufacturing industries.

This proposition is corroborated by two sets of bubble detection strategies: the first set consists of tests for financial bubbles, while the second set consists of the log-periodic power law (LPPL) model for negative financial bubbles. Despite the methodological differences between these detection methods, they provided the same outcome: the oil price experienced a statistically significant negative financial bubble in the last months of 2014 and at the beginning of 2015. These results also hold after several robustness checks which consider the effect of conditional heteroskedasticity, model set-ups with additional restrictions, longer data samples, tests with lower frequency data and with an alternative proxy variable to measure the fundamental value of oil.

For a range of CO2 prices and respective risks perceived by the forest owner (seller) and electricity producer (buyer), we apply a model of fair (indifference) pricing. Parties' risk preferences are reflected by exponential utility functions. The potentially contracted amounts of REDD offsets are analyzed under various risk preferences and for different benefit-sharing opportunities. Our results show that a risk-averse attitude considerably increases the contracted offset amounts (compared to risk neutral case) and, therefore, creates a higher potential for REDD implementation. We demonstrate possible situations, when parties could agree on a certain range of REDD contracts, e.g. smaller amounts of REDD offsets are traded for higher prices, and larger amounts - for lower prices, although contracting a moderate amount at a moderate price is impossible. The suggested benefit-sharing mechanism can help increase contracted offset amounts. Our modeling results highlight two ways to promote higher REDD participation: (i) strengthening the carbon price signal to reveal risk-averse behavior of energy producers, and (ii) implementing the mechanism of benefit/risk sharing between the REDD consumer and supplier.

Energy crops are subjected to persistent policy support by the EU, despite their limited or even marginally negative impact on the greenhouse effect. The present study endeavors to optimize the agricultural income generated by energy crops in a remote and disadvantageous region, with the assistance of linear programming. The optimization concerns the income created from soybean, sunflower (proxy for energy crop), and corn. Different policy scenarios imposed restrictions on the value of the subsidies as a proxy for EU policy tools, the value of inputs (costs of capital and labor) and different irrigation conditions. The results indicate that the area and the imports per energy crop remain unchanged, independently of the policy scenario enacted. Furthermore, corn cultivation contributes the most to iFncome maximization, whereas the implemented CAP policy plays an incremental role in up taking an energy crop. A key implication is that alternative forms of motivation should be provided to the farmers beyond the financial ones in order the extensive use of energy crops to be achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, especially regulatory and policy risks have been shown to play a major role for investors when evaluating investments in renewable energy and should thus also be taken into account in risk assessment and when deriving risk-return profiles. In this paper, we provide a stochastic model framework to quantify policy risks associated with renewable energy investments (e.g. a retrospective reduction of a feed-in tariff), thereby also taking into account energy price risk, resource risk, and inflation risk. The model is illustrated by means of simulations and scenario analyses, and it makes use of expert estimates and fuzzy set theory for quantifying policy risks. Our numerical results for a portfolio of onshore wind farms in Germany and France show that policy risk can strongly impact risk-return profiles, and that cross-country diversification effects can considerably decrease the overall risk for investors.

Following the distribution dynamics approach, the role of a set of intangible assets is considered by introducing several conditioning schemes. In line with previous contributions the results suggest that the distribution of income is bimodal.

In the transportation sector such policies are becoming ever more popular, and have been implemented in a considerable number of countries in recent years. Because these policies promote energy-efficient cars with lower usage costs, they may rebound and increase the distances traveled by households that have switched to energy efficient cars. From an econometric perspective, a subsidization policy can be used as a valid instrument to identify the households' choice of energy efficiency levels of the cars they own. This identification, in turn, can be utilized to account for endogeneity in the estimation of a rebound effect. The present study uses a natural experiment setting of such a policy implemented in Israel in 2009. The empirical results indicate a fairly large average rebound effect of 40%. The results also indicate that while the policy indeed encouraged the purchase of energy-efficient cars, households that bought a new or used car during the surveyed period did not generate a rebound effect of a different magnitude compared with other households that did not. We discuss the implications of our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To deal with such problems, in this paper, we establish an agent-based, computational economics system to provide a formal evaluation of the direct and indirect influences of several issued increasing block tariffs in the residential gas market. Moreover, a comprehensive demand response behaviour model has been improved in term of price elasticity, while still coping with income levels and complex social environment. We also compute and compare the outcomes of several increasing block tariffs with the initial flat tariff by running the system on a test-case using real-world data from a middle-scale gas retail market in Wuhan. The results indicate that there is an appropriate increasing block gas tariff scheme that has greater ability to improve social equity while still ensuring operator revenue and promoting gas conservation. In order to offset the limitations of the proposed increasing block tariffs, the regulator should adopt some complementary measures, such as applying appropriate policies targeting the intended consumers, and allowing large families to obtain extra allowance of volume.

The United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland have set ambitious targets which require 30% and 40% of electricity demand to come from RE, mainly wind, by 2020, respectively. Ireland has sufficient indigenous onshore wind energy resources to exceed the RE target, while the UK faces uncertainty in achieving its target. A possible solution for the UK is to import RE directly from large scale onshore and offshore wind energy projects in Ireland; this possibility has recently been explored by both governments but is currently on hold. Thus, the aim of this paper is to estimate the effects of large scale wind energy in the Irish and British electricity markets in terms of wholesale system marginal prices, total generation costs and CO2 emissions. The results indicate when the large scale Irish-based wind energy projects are connected directly to the UK there is a decrease of 0.6% and 2% in the Irish and British wholesale system marginal prices under the UK National Grid slow progression scenario, respectively.

When not sick, children and their caregivers without proper access to such services have to allocate their leisure time in order to meet their water and sanitation needs. It is through these health and leisure time use changes that access to water and sanitation services impacts the educational attainment of children. This paper proposes a household utility maximization model in which access and sanitation services determine the child's health, which in turn affects the child's education and the household welfare. Comparative statics indicate that households consider the health gains to the market value of their leisure time, and the changes in the consumption of other goods. The model is applied to data from Brazil. In order to sort out the endogeneity between provision of water and sanitation services, and educational attainment, the paper uses an instrumental approach, based on the technical features of the water systems and an instrument that measures a proxy of water availability within the municipality territory. Estimates suggest that access to water and sanitation services has a positive and significant effect on schooling, when measured by the completed number of school years. These positive effects call for the expansion of the laggard sewerage systems in the country, both at home and at school. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Indian power sector was reformed in the early 1990s. However, reforms are effective only as much as the regulators are committed in ensuring that they are implemented. We hypothesize that higher the quality of regulation in a federal Indian state, higher is the efficiency of electric generation utilities. A translog stochastic frontier model is estimated using index of state-level independent regulation as one of the determinants of inefficiency. The dataset comprises a panel of 77 coal-based thermal power plants during the reform period covering over 70% of installed electricity generation capacity. The mean technical efficiency of 76.7% indicates there is wide scope for efficiency improvement in the sector. Results are robust to various model specifications and show that state-level regulators have positively impacted plant performance. Technical efficiency is sensitive to both unbundling of state utilities, and regulatory experience. The policy implication is that further reforms which empower independent regulators will have far reaching impacts on power sector performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Reductions in price and increases in volatility are observed when EP decisions are (i) not party-political in origin, (ii) made during times of low market sentiment, or (iii) made during times of low market attention. Daily EUA prices from 2007 to 2014 are used in the study, with decisions analysed using an event study approach for price impact, and a GARCH specification for volatility impact. Our findings suggest the need for policymakers to improve communication of long-term strategies for the EUA market. This aims to reduce the evident ongoing uncertainty experienced by traders around each decision made by the EP. The finding that sentiment and market attention at the time of an EP decision influences the market's reaction indicates a need to consider market dynamics in terms of decision timing, so that market turbulence is not an unintended by-product of an EP decision. Some form of medium term forward guidance may be called for. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The study employs the recently developed ARDL-bounds testing approach. The article finds there is strong evidence that growth rate of income, gross domestic savings play a stronger role in determining the short run and long run behavior of energy consumption per capita in G7 countries. The empirical results suggested that in most of the countries the relationship of consumption per capita and gross domestic income is positive, that means when the income rises the consumption will also rise but not necessarily at the same rate, which is in accordance with theory of Keynes of marginal propensity to consume, confirming the absolute income hypothesis. On the other hand the gross domestic savings has a negative relationship with the energy consumption per capita which confirms the same relationship of consumption as the function of difference of income and savings in long run. The Parameters of error correction terms in USA and France are -0.4283 and -0.6190 represents the speed of adjustment is very high and it would return back to the equilibrium level very quickly. While countries like Canada, Germany, and Great Britain are having the parameters of the error correction term as -0.0794, -0.2205, and -0.0867 suggests speed of adjustments is fairly very small and would take time to return to its equilibrium position. While the error correction coefficient in case of Japan is equal to -1.0183, and also statistically significant showing that convergence is more elastic. The study suggests that although Japan, Italy, USA, France are more industrially advanced countries as production is mostly based on industries. The income generated on the basis of the energy consumption in their industries may be used as forced savings to further boost the economy that will definitely affects their growth performance positively in the long run. The reliability and validity of the estimations results are confirmed by the diagnostics tests. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Their need for satisfaction is the most important driver of consumer behavior with the consumer choosing how they fulfill this need. Unfortunately, consumer decisions often lead to consumer misbehavior and negative effects on the service provider or on other consumers. Consumer misbehavior is difficult to control. First, it is not always possible to prove misbehavior of a particular consumer. On the other hand, preventive actions, like social campaigns, may not always reach the target audience. Moreover, neither service provider regulations nor monitoring of infrastructure sufficiently prevents consumers from misbehaving in every case. It seems, however, that the consumers who reject the fraudulent behavior of others have a crucial role in the fight against consumer misbehavior, as they are constant observers of this phenomenon and can react immediately. The aim of this article, therefore, is to present the concept of consumer misbehavior with examples relating to the tourism market. Moreover, the attitudes of consumers towards consumer misbehavior are examined through nethnographic research.","[Grybs-Kabocik, Marta; Marie, Agnieszka] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Grybs-Kabocik, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",marta.grybs@gmail.com; agnieszka.marie@gmail.com,,,National Science Centre [2013/11/B/HS4/01470],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The publication has been created as a part of Project 2013/11/B/HS4/01470 financed by the National Science Centre.,,15,0,1,1,4,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,121,125,,10.12955/cbup.v4.751,0.0,,,5,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000019,0

Apart from the two factors, however, L2 learners' proficiency in the target language may also affect L1 transfer. 80 non-English first-year undergraduates participated and a language proficiency test and two questionnaires were employed in the study to investigate the influences of Chinese on English learning. The results showed that the Chinese EFL learners' perception of the specificity of Chinese topic-prominent structures, English proficiency, and the interaction between the two factors all significantly affected the transferability of the Chinese topic-prominent structures to their acquisition of the English subject-prominent structures.

The obtained results are part of a study on the characteristics of marital relations and their influence on the choice of the spouses' patterns of behavior during conflict situations. The results suggest that the choice of different strategies of behavior in a situation of conflict among our respondents mainly depends on: the degree of insistence in fulfillment of personal interests, and the level of cooperation in addressing the interests of others. As a dominant style in marital conflict resolution our respondents use the avoiding style. During the study, gender differences between spouses, how they perceive, understand, and resolve marriage conflicts were found. Women are more critical toward their abilities to resolve conflict. In such situations they often use negative behavior, compared to men who are more likely to deny or avoid situations of conflict.

We find the incremental route is likely to involve the largest production volumes and greenhouse gas benefits until at least the mid-2020s, but transitional and leapfrog biofuels together have far greater long-term potential. We estimate that the Renewable Fuel Standard, California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and federal tax credits provided an incentive of roughly $1.5-2.5 per gallon of leapfrog biofuel between 2012 and 2015, but that regulatory elements in these policies mostly incentivize lower-risk incremental investments.

Bearing in mind the instant technological innovations, the decision models in the energy use need to be designed in holistic way. As the energy consumption is influenced also by non-technical and non-economic factors, sustainable energy use is expected to include behavioral aspects as well. The aim of this article is to provide insight into theoretical concepts in behavioral research especially in residential energy use. Behavioral aspects relevant for the energy use are detected and the main emphasis is given to the prospect theory. Energy efficiency is explained and analysed in broader perspective. This paper shows that following the complexity of relationships in energy field the behavioral economics has a good potential to be more influential in the future of the energy.","[Pechancova, Viera] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Pechancová, V (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",pechancova@fame.utb.cz,"Pechancová, Viera/HOH-3963-2023","Pechancová, Viera/0000-0002-9254-5600",,,,,26,0,0,0,0,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-592-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,291,298,,10.7441/dokbat.2016.30,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6IP,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000466741400030,0

However, despite the positive steps proceed with Edna's gradual awakening, powerful social forces are arrayed against her. Unable to find a way to translate her spiritual awareness of her freedom into reality, Edna surrenders and stops struggling, committing suicide in the sea.

The spatial scales examined are minimum comparable areas, microregions, mesoregions and states between 1970 and 2000. Alternative spatial panel data models with fixed effects were systematically estimated across those spatial scales to demonstrate that the estimated coefficients change with the scale level. The results show that the conclusions obtained from growth regressions depend on the choice of spatial scale. First, the values of spatial spillover coefficients vary according to the spatial scale under analysis. In general, such coefficients are statistically significant at the MCA, microregional and mesoregional levels, however, at state level those coefficients are no longer statistically significant, suggesting that spatial spillovers are bounded in space. Moreover, the positive average-years-of-schooling direct effect coefficient increases as more aggregate spatial scales are used. Population density coefficients show that higher populated areas are harmful to economic growth, indicating that congestion effects are operating in all spatial scales, but their magnitudes vary across geographic scales. Finally, the club convergence hypothesis cannot be rejected suggesting that there are differences in the convergence processes between the north and south in Brazil. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential theoretical reasons for different results found across estimations at different spatial scales.","[Resende, Guilherme Mendes; Ywata de Carvalho, Alexandre Xavier; Morita Sakowski, Patricia Alessandra] Govt Brazil, IPEA, BR-70076900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland",Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Resende, GM (通讯作者)，Govt Brazil, IPEA, BR-70076900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",guilherme.resende@ipea.gov.br; cravo@wider.unu.edu,"Resende, Guilherme Mendes/K-5821-2012",,,,,,81,21,21,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

As we all know, the health management of medical institutions will directly affect the development process, even the survival conditions. The development of health management professionalization is related to the prospects of medical institutions in the future, as it is an important part of the medical institutions management. Therefore, it is suggested to strengthen the professionalized construction of health management team, which is also the requirement to adapt to the health care industry reform, and the needs to meet social development. In this paper, it points out problems existed in the development by analyzing the current situation of health management posts, and then puts forward some suggestions to improve the professionalized development, thus promoting the smooth development of the professionalization of health management team. The smooth operation of medical institutions requires a high- level management team, and the healthy and sustained development of health service is inseparable from high- level management. So, the importance of health management in the medical industry is self- evident; besides, the quality, efficiency and capacity of management team have the direct bearing on the survival of hospitals, and even the reform and development of medical and health services. The key issue is focused on how to train staffs who love their posts and are passionate about the health management career. The problem of health management professionalization has been always existed, for example, some staffs don't have titles even working at the posts, and some talents can't even find posts. Generally, health management staffs without titles are usually poorly treated, and have difficulty gaining recognition from the health system leadership. This is bound to affect the choice of practitioners, who may not regard this profession as a lifelong career. In the long run, the professionalized development of health management will be affected. Therefore, this problem must be attached with great attention and to be improved in the reform.","[Tao, Jun; Liu, Yong] Sch Gannan Med Univ, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Gannan Medical University,"Tao, J (通讯作者)，Sch Gannan Med Univ, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",20094200@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-288-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,87.0,,,,,,844,847,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8WB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392733200176,0

Nowadays, both these concepts are slowly penetrating into the consciousness of the lay and professional public in Slovakia. This article is based on the single part of mentioned research related with the problem of business ethics. This consist of three main research questions. At the beginning we examined if surveyed companies have prepared an Ethical Code or the Code of Conduct and if they implement this in business practice. Second question assayed if ethical behavior helps enterprises to achieve business objectives and the third question deals with the problem if company favors business partners who prefer similar corporate values and business.

The objective of this study is twofold. First, I aim to provide initial empirical evidence of the extent to which split incentives between landlords and tenants may lead to underinvestment. Second, I investigate the influence of tax credits and energy burdens on energy efficiency expenditures. Given the complexity of studying the decision to invest in energy-saving renovations, I use a bivariate Tobit model to compare decisions about energy-efficient works and repair works, even when the renovation expenditures seem quite similar. The analysis shows that tenants are doubly penalized: they have high energy expenditures due to energy-inefficient building characteristics, and because they are poorer than homeowners, they are unable to invest in energy-saving systems. The results also confirm that tax credits are ineffective in the split incentives context. In terms of public policy, the government should focus on low-income tenants, and mandatory measures such as minimum standards seem appropriate. Financial support from a third-party financer also might be a solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that agglomeration benefits combined with search and additional frictions (e.g., fixed costs and imperfect recognition of the benefits) can generate a transitory endogenous growth path that is consistent with the set of empirical regularities observed over the economic development process: gradual rural-to-urban migration and the resulting urban concentration, productivity improvement, urban unemployment, and wage and unemployment gaps across regions, which diminish with economic development.

The utilization of clean coal technologies is a likely strategic choice for China at present, however, although there have been many successes in clean coal technologies worldwide, they are not widely used in China. This paper examines the challenges that China faces in the implementation of such clean coal technologies, where the analysis shows that those drivers that have a negative bearing on the utilization of clean coal in China are mainly non-technical factors such as the low legal liability of atmospheric pollution related to coal use, and the lack of laws and mandatory regulations for clean coal use in China. Policies for the development of clean coal technologies are in their early stages in China, and the lack of laws and detailed implementation requirements for clean coal require resolution in order to accelerate China's clean coal developments. Currently, environmental pollution has gained widespread attention from the wider Chinese populace and taking advantage of this opportunity provides a space in which to regain the initiative to raise people's awareness of clean coal products, and improve enterprises' enthusiasm for clean coal.

The results support the pro-enforcement argument. Cumulatively, there is clear evidence for a general deterrence effect of enforcement intensity on the amount of waste crime.

In this study, we firstly summarize the definition of the current levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) based methodology for the concept and address its limitation in not taking into account the systematic changes in an electric power system. Secondly, we introduce a bottom-up energy system model based methodology to overcome the limitation. Lastly, we apply the methodology to a case study, the grid parity analysis of solar photovoltaic and onshore wind technologies in the Korean electric power system, to highlight the differences between the results obtained using both methodologies. The results of the study show three implications. First, even if the LCOE of onshore wind is already lower than that of natural gas technologies and the average price of grid electricity, the LCOE is required to be much lower to achieve cost-competitiveness in the electric power system. Second, different technologies might be required to have different LCOE levels to be cost-competitive in the same power system. Third, a policy or plan for the deployment of renewable energy technologies must be harmonized with other policies and plans within the same system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The major concern is that it may further accelerate China's energy demand. Using a unique urban household level dataset, the China Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS), we investigate residential energy consumption for heating and examine the energy intensity and energy cost of distributed heating in South China and district heating in North China during the 2012 heating season. Our results show that the total energy consumption for distributed heating system users in southern cities is significantly lower than for users of district heating systems in northern cities. However, when accounting for the heating area and heating season, the distributed heating households in the South consumed 32% more energy and paid 189% higher cost per unit area and per hour, but had lower comfort than district heating users in the North. These findings suggest promoting the district heating market in appropriate areas in South China. This not only can improve residential welfare, but also can indirectly reduce energy consumption and financial burdens. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that energy intensity (EI) and industrial activity (IA) are the main determinants of the changes in carbon dioxide. Energy intensity (EI) contributes to decrease in emissions within 25 years while industrial activity (IA) acts in a positive way to increase the emissions level. Industry scale (IS) mostly contributes to increase in emissions except for the time interval 1996-2000. However, for both carbon intensity (Cl) and energy structure (ES), they have a volatile but not significant influence on emissions in the different time intervals. To further understand the effects, we analyze the cumulative emission during the whole period 1986-2010. The results further testify that energy intensity and industrial activity are the most important factors affecting reduction and growth of carbon emissions. The results indicate that efforts to reduce emission in China's food industry should focus on the enhancement of energy efficiency, the optimization of industrial scale and the restructuring energy use. Finally, recommendations are provided for the reduction of carbon dioxide in China's food industry. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DERs reduce the customers' electricity bills and hence the revenues collected by their LSE. However, changes in customer demand profiles can potentially reduce the aggregated system demand profile, and therefore, reduce the LSE's costs in wholesale markets. Analysis of these financial impacts indicates that the LSE's lost revenue ultimately outweighs its reduced expenses. This is largely due to a significant reduction in revenue from demand charges. Dispatchable DERs, including energy storages and demand response, result in more financial losses for LSEs than photovoltaics. The financial losses LSEs face indicate that redesigning commercial customer tariffs is necessary in order for ISEs to accommodate customer owned DERs properly. Several suggestions on modifying commercial tariffs are presented. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By combining firm-level data with information on the regional environment, we can distinguish between composition effects caused by the selection of highly innovative firms in specific regions and the impact of regional factors. Our results indicate that the propensity to innovate of firms located in agglomerations significantly exceeds the innovation output of plants in rural regions. To analyze the role of the regional context for the firm's probability to innovate, we use a multilevel approach. Besides controlling for important firm-level factors such as R&D employment, size and age of the firm, we also account for different regional factors. The regression results point to a positive association between regional R&D activity and the firm's innovation output. Moreover, the effect of the regional context seems to differ with the size, age and R&D intensity of the firms.","[Naz, Amber] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Niebuhr, Annekatrin; Peters, Jan Cornelius] Inst Employment Res, IAB Nord, Reg Res Network, D-24106 Kiel, Germany; [Niebuhr, Annekatrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Empir Labor Econ & Spatial Econometr, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; University of Kiel,"Naz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",ammi3212@gmail.com; annekatrin.niebuhr@iab.de; cornelius.peters2@iab.de,,"Peters, Jan Cornelius/0000-0001-9328-3078; Niebuhr, Annekatrin/0000-0001-8218-0954",,,,,36,25,25,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The research was carried out under a much wider research project, VIGOR, with the aim to explore the feasibility of geothermal energy utilization in southern Italy. This study has two primary objectives: (1) to explore the views and opinions of local communities regarding the potential of geothermal energy applications; (2) to contribute to the growing literature on public engagement with energy issues. In order to explore public views towards geothermal technologies, we conducted a case study using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Although Italy has enormous geological potential for geothermal energy production, levels of knowledge of this energy source amongst the public are low. The results indicate that the issue is shrouded in uncertainty and that the Sicilian public expresses a diffused lack of trust in decision-making processes. Taken together, these factors are likely to strongly impact eventual further developments in this sector. The results clearly show the need for further societal dialogue supported by a sound communication action strategy as the first stage in a public participation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TPO firms sign long-term agreements with building owners or users to install, finance and manage locally sited solar panels. Customers simply buy solar electricity. The business model can increase total PV market demand by removing central barriers to PV adoption including technology risk, financing needs, and learning costs. TPO is now the dominant US model for residential solar and attempts to use the business model are underway in Europe and Asia. This study discusses how policy makers can enable emergence of solar TPO business models in new markets, a theme novel to extant literature. The paper is based on a comprehensive study of the US solar TPO ecosystem including 50 interviews with key market actors. A downside to the TPO model is potential lock-out of innovative solar technology. Crucial policy actions to enable TPO emergence in new markets are to ensure the legality of the TPO model and to facilitate solar self-consumption (the ability of customers to offset grid electricity costs by using locally generated solar electricity).

Although much has been written on the topic, there have been few large-scale ex post evaluations of the actual impacts of such schemes. We address this by assessing domestic energy use before and after the Kirklees Warm Zone (KWZ) scheme, which by fitting insulation in 51,000 homes in the 2007-2010 period is one of the largest retrofit schemes completed in the UK to date. To do this, we develop and apply a new methodology that isolates the impacts of retrofit activity from broader background trends in energy use. The results suggest that the actual impacts of the KWZ scheme have been higher than predicted, and that the scale of any performance gaps or rebound effects have been lower than has often been assumed. They also suggest that impacts on energy use in lower income areas are consistent with predictions, but that impacts in middle and higher income areas are higher than predicted. These findings support the case for the wider and/or accelerated adoption of domestic retrofit schemes in other contexts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These dynamics are captured through the processes of learning (cognitive proximity), integration (organizational proximity), decoupling (social proximity), institutionalization (institutional proximity), and agglomeration (geographical proximity).

The question is explored using a comprehensive large-scale longitudinal dataset of high-end fashion organizations and their selection of stylistic trends presented at biannual fashion shows.

There is however lack of analysis of political and social processes which govern its actual take up. This paper examines these processes through a case study of Aberdeen, Scotland. Interviews and documentary analysis are used to examine the 2002 development of Aberdeen Heat and Power (AHP), an independent energy services company (ESCo). Technical-economic feasibility was a necessary component of appraisal, but not sufficient to govern decision-making. In the UK centralised energy market, DH investment is unattractive to commercial investors, and local authorities lack capacity and expertise in energy provision. In Aberdeen, the politics of fuel poverty converged with climate politics, creating an a-typical willingness to innovate through improvisation. The welfare priority resulted in creation of a non-profit locally-owned ESCo, using cost- rather than market-based heat tariffs. AHP has developed three combined heat and power energy centres and heat networks, supplying 34 MWh/pa of heat. Carbon savings are estimated to be 45% in comparison with electric heating, and heating costs are reduced by a similar amount. The conclusion outlines potential policy improvements.

Using a new global data set, this article investigates whether these illicit tactics are merely blemishes or substantially undermine the economic efficacy of elections. We show that illicit tactics are widespread, and that they reduce the incentive for governments to deliver good economic performance. Our analysis also suggests that in societies with regular free and fair elections, leaders do not matter for economic growth.","[Collier, Paul] Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX1 4JJ, England; [Hoeffler, Anke] Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Blavatnik Sch Govt, 10 Merton St, Oxford OX1 4JJ, England.",paul.collier@economics.ox.ac.uk; anke.hoeffler@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Hoeffler, Anke/0000-0002-0684-6096",Open Society Institute,Open Society Institute,"We would like to thank the editor, Jon Temple, Jennifer Castle and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

The model is then empirically implemented through a two-stage estimation procedure. We argue that this estimation procedure is only valid under the strong distributional assumptions maintained in the article. Statistical tests using the HMR sample, however, clearly reject such assumptions. Moreover, we perform numerical experiments which show that the HMR two-stage estimator is very sensitive to departures from the assumption of homoskedasticity. These findings cast doubts on any inference drawn from the empirical implementation of the HMR model.","[Silva, J. M. C. Santos] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Silva, J. M. C.

Theories of the firm and strategic management argue that competitive advantage originates in the development and exploitation of assets or capabilities that may be internal or external to the firm. It might be anticipated that older, larger, foreign-owned and multi-plant firms draw upon internal resources more readily than young, small, domestic, single-plant firms. Do the benefits of agglomeration vary among business establishments according to their characteristics? This question is examined using plant-level, longitudinal, micro-data from the Canadian manufacturing sector.

Currently online news sites have greatly satisfied the expectations of the readers, and there has been a decrease in the circulation of print newspapers. This study examines the consumer choice of print and online media with respect to demographics and preference of format. The study adopted a primary quantitative data collection approach wherein a paper based survey of 102 journalists was carried out. This research paper inspected the impact of the variables involved (online media and print media) on each other as well as the cause-effect relationship between them. It also highlighted the two main categories of input - descriptive research and explorative research. To tabulate results of the former, the qualitative data that had been collected (after conducting the Elite and Specialized Interview, and the Focus Group Interview). These three facets were then examined simultaneously on the basis of certain hypotheses made, which were fittingly measured with the help of the Chi-Square (or the Null Hypothesis) test. It was concluded that there is no association between the type of media and personal attributes. Large majority of the respondents, irrespective of their gender, nationality, age, education and income, prefer online media, particularly, internet. The only exception is the senior citizen with age above 50 years, still prefer to go with the print media, specifically, newspapers. It confirms that there is no statistically significant association between reasons and the preference for the type of media. It means that according to the type of media, the reasons do not vary significantly. It can empirically conclude that online media affects print media. Impact of online media on print media happens on the various aspects of print media viz. demand, subscription, market share, print revenue, advertising revenue and profitability.

In this short study we propose a new usability for the already existent open source JavaScript based charts libraries. Even if they were designed for other usages like an alternative for bar charts (the case of bubble chart) or for the first Web 2.0 sites (the case of tag clouds), they can be easily adapted to represent complex ontologies. The first part of this paper presents the main known graphical representations used by the semantic web experts. The way in which we can adapt other charts to display ontologies together with some graphical examples are presented in the final part of the study.","Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iancu, B (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bogdan.iancu@ie.ase.ro,"Iancu, Bogdan M/J-3364-2016",,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,116,121,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900020,0

The results from the study illustrated that there are 3 types of stakeholders who are involved in cultural tourism promotion and policy formation: 1. Government agency of Luang Prabang and Sukhothai such as, the Heritage House which is responsible for the management of the tourist attractions and town's patrimony in the country under the supervision of UNESCO but for Thailand there is the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Ministry of Sport and Tourism and Fine Art Departments. 2. Entrepreneur includes not only, hospitality, restaurant, and tourism business, but also entertainment business and tourism training business. They are considered to be parts of the support in enhancing cultural tourism to promote the impressive services for visitors. 3. General public understood and agreed with government management.

Nonetheless, understanding spatial-temporal variability of rainfall especially at seasonal level, is an imperative facet to rain-fed agricultural productivity and natural resource management (NRM). This study evaluated the extent of seasonal rainfall variability and the drought characteristics as the first step of combating declining agricultural productivity in the region. Cumulative Departure Index (CDI), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) and Coefficients-of-Variance (CV) and probabilistic statistics were utilized in the analyses of rainfall variability. Analyses showed 90 % chance of below cropping-threshold rainfall (500 mm) exceeding 213.5 mm (Machanga) and 258.1 mm (Embu) during SRs for one year return-period. Rainfall variability was found to be high in seasonal amounts (CV = 0.56 and 0.38) and in number of rainy-days (CV = 0.88 and 0.27) at Machang'a and Embu, respectively. Monthly rainfall variability was found to be equally high even during April (peak) and November (CV = 0.42 and 0.48 and 0.76 and 0.43) with high probabilities (0.40 and 0.67) of droughts exceeding 15 days in Embu and Machang'a, respectively. Dry-spell probabilities within growing months were high (81 %) and (60 %) in Machang'a and Embu respectively. To optimize yield in the area, use of soil-water conservation and supplementary irrigation, crop selection and timely accurate rainfall forecasting should be prioritized.","[Kisaka, M.

Mainly due to the intangibility associated with tourism, the image of destinations is critical to their success and its importance has been widely supported in the related literature of recent decades. Several authors argue that it is of relevance to understand, firstly, which are the factors that determine and shape tourist destinations image and, secondly, which are the attitudinal and behavioral consequences taken by its receivers. This paper, framed in the final phase of an ongoing research project, aims to review the literature on the image effects on attitudinal loyalty of the tourism industry intermediaries, as well as some of the image antecedents of tourist destinations image, such as socio-psychological motivations, socio-demographic features and sales profile of the tourist intermediary, previous experience in the destination and finally type and variety of information sources. It results in an enlightening conceptual model of the several push and pull factors that determine global, affective and cognitive images of a destination taken by travel agents and tour operators, as well as its intention to recommend the destination to their customers. The contribution of this paper lies with the proposal of a conceptual model of tourist destinations image on the less studied perspective of the tourist intermediaries. As future research, it is suggested the test of the proposed conceptual model, which will be part of the final conclusions of this research project. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In the assessment, the research has undertaken the task of integrating two models namely: the Delone and Mclean's information system success model, and the Balanced Scorecard. The models contributed to perspectives which assess the success of Hakeem. Triangulation methods using qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted. This involves an interview, and questionnaire which results were used to build a case study. Prince Hamzah Hospital which implements Hakeem is central to the study. The results showed all Internal perspectives proposed by the two integrated models have strongly influenced the success of Hakeem. Another obvious result is in the relation between the perspectives which affect each other and reflected on the EHR success. This research has proposed an integrated EHR model that could be used in assessing the success of any EHR implementation.

The results indicate that the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation are indispensable for ensuring food security in semi-arids where rainfall is very variable.","[Ngugi, L.

Later the scope of investigation widened and now along with growth topic includes influence of the type of financial system on financial stability, culture, juridical system of a country. Fostering financial stability is a complex process, which scope is wider than applying solely monetary and fiscal policies in a country. In this respect particular attention should be paid to financial stability of monetary financial institutions, as well as reputation and competence of their management. Type of financial system, namely bank-based and market-based, determines major financial institutions, stability of which is crucial for a country's financial system. Type of country's financial system must be determined to equip financial supervisors with more efficient decision-making tools.

The concentration and centralisation of emissions in the European Union Emissions Trading System,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emissions trading; EU ETS; Energy liberalisation; Climate change; Carbon accounting; Coal,ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY; MARKET; INTERNATIONALIZATION; POLITICS; SECTOR; STATE; EU,"This article questions the assumption that carbon markets create a level playing field by exploring the relationshipbetween the organisation of capital and the organisation-of emissions in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). It constructs a database by matching installations and owners to reveal that a relatively small number of large-scale coal-fired power stations, owned by a very small group of states and corporations, are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. The findings are analysed by considering how technological dependence on coal together with the corporate institutional form combine to support the socio-spatial concentration and centralisation of capital and emissions. Case studies of the consolidation of the seven largest polluting owners from Europe's coal-dependent electricity sector and the carbon trading strategies of the two largest polluters, RWE and E.ON, then assess the impacts of energy liberalisation and emissions trading policies. The article concludes-that EU energy and climate policies are pulling in different directions by clustering responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and diffusing responsibility to address climate change. The uneven distribution of emissions within the EU ETS makes an alternative policy approach that directly targets the biggest corporate and state polluters both feasible and necessary.

Through use-of natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms, we expand patent classification capabilities to better explain the history of biofuels innovation. Results indicate that after the initial establishment of the U.S. biofuel industry, there were two surges in biofuel innovation: 1995-2000, characterized by heavy patenting by 1st generation (food-based) biofuel firms; and 2005-2010, characterized by a second surge of innovation by those same large firms, complemented by a large number of biotechnology firms producing a relatively small number of 2nd generation biofuel patents. Our analysis corroborates the widespread understanding that the first surge in biofuel innovation was linked to innovations in agriculture, and that the second surge of biofuel innovation was driven by demand-pull policies mandating and incentivizing biofuels. But the slow emergence of a 2nd generation cellulose-based biofuels industry, far slower than called for by policy, suggests that technology-push policies more focused on R&D and investment may be needed to accelerate the commercialization of 2nd generation biofuels.

Analysis of 215,444 inspection records for 70,043 conventional and unconventional wells was conducted in order to compare the odds of violations occurring under different circumstances. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of violations occurring for both conventional and unconventional wells. When inspected, conventional wells had 40% higher odds of having a violation. However, unconventional wells had higher odds for environmental violations related to waste discharge as well as cementing and casing failures. Large operators had 40% lower odds of having any violation than smaller operators. While larger operators had fewer violations, a few of the largest companies had rates of violation much higher than the average for all operators, with some reaching violation rates as high as 1 in 4 active wells. A well also has a higher chance of being in violation if it is in the first year (85%) or second year (109%) since its spud date. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Governments worldwide are seeking solutions that will ensure security of their energy supplies, while reducing carbon emissions in the fight against climate change. Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance'. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, it is important to understand consumers' preference for the renewable energy towards the continuous growing renewable energy society. We use a discrete choice experiment to infer consumers' preferences when the share of renewable energy increases. The study results indicate that consumers are generally willing to pay extra for an increasing share of renewable energy, but the renewable energy should come from a mixture of renewable energy sources. We also found that consumers prefer to trade with their current supplier rather than another well-known supplier. This study contributes to the energy portfolio theories and the theory of energy diversification in a consumer perspective. The managerial implications of this study are also discussed.

The aim is to assess the overall socio-economic impact of energy saving renovation measures defined in Croatian strategic documents in terms of the direct, indirect and induced growth of gross value added, employment and government revenues. An estimate of the avoided costs of air pollution is also included. The overall economic impact assessment is based on an input-output methodology. From the point of view of individual investors, the benefits in terms of reduced future expenses related to energy products are usually below energy efficient renovation investment costs, making an investment financially viable only if government support is provided. If the benefits for society as a whole are included, energy efficient renovation could be assessed as viable even in the short-run. Energy saving retrofits of residential and public buildings positively contribute to economic growth, employment and protection of the environment. Because of economic growth, the tax revenues induced by these investments could compensate for government expenditures, and the overall impact on the public deficit is expected to be neutral even in the short-run.

Implementing an ETS in a rapidly growing economy in which government authorities exercise significant control over markets poses many challenges. This study assesses how well three of the most developed pilot ETSs, in Guangdong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, have adapted carbon emissions trading to China's economic and political context. We base our study on new information gathered through interviews with local pilot ETS regulators and experts, analysis of recent trading data, and extensive legal and literature reviews. We point out instances in which pilot regulators have deftly tailored carbon emissions trading to China's unique context and instances in which designs are insufficient to ensure smooth operation. We also indicate areas in which broader institutional reforms of China's political economy may be required for carbon emissions trading to operate successfully. We make nine recommendations to improve the design and operation of the pilot programs and to inform the construction of a national CO2 ETS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By using micro-level data collected from 1450 households in 27 provinces in the first ever China Residential Energy Consumption Survey in 2012, this study estimates the effects of three DSM measures empirically: tiered household electricity pricing, China Energy Label program, and information feedback mechanisms. We find these measures have contributed to moderating residential electricity demand growth but additional policy reform and tools are needed to increase their effectiveness and impact. Residential electricity demand is found to be price- and income- inelastic and tiered pricing alone may not be as effective in electricity conservation. The statistically significant relationship between China Energy Label efficient refrigerators - but not televisions - and lowered residential electricity consumption reflect mixed program effectiveness. Lastly, of the information feedback currently available through electricity bills, payment frequency and meters, only meter reader is estimated to be statistically significant. Important policy implications and recommendations for improving each of these three DSM measures to expand their impact on reducing residential electricity consumption are identified.

Individual level pro-environmental behavior affects environmental quality in the aggregate. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes individual's pro-environmental behaviors to change. We quantify the causal effect of one determinant, unemployment, using an EU-27 population representative Eurobarometer survey. Drawing on results from the theory of the private provision of public goods, and recognizing that unemployment decreases income and the opportunity cost of time, we formulate testable predictions that unemployment will decrease the extent of pro-environmental behaviors that require monetary contributions and increase the extent of pro-environmental behaviors that mainly require time/effort. Instrumental variables regressions provide empirical evidence to support these hypotheses. Changes in the unemployment rate within a sub-national region provide the exogenous variation needed to identify the causal effect. Several supplemental questions on the survey provide evidence that environmental issues lose saliency and economic issues gain saliency when one becomes unemployed, suggesting that interested parties may wish to emphasize cost savings of pro-environmental behavior rather than environmental benefits during times of increased unemployment.

More recently, a number of measures have emerged to mitigate this risk. The study focuses on solar industry's best practice energy resource estimation and assesses its financing implications to the 27 MWp solar PV project study in Brunei Darussalam. The best practice in resource estimation uses multiple data sources through the measure-correlate-predict (MCP) technique as compared with the standard practice that rely solely on modelled data source. The best practice case generates resource data with lower uncertainty and yields superior high confidence energy production estimate than the standard practice case. Using project financial parameters in Brunei Darussalam for project financing and adopting the international debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) benchmark rates, the best practice case yields DSCRs that surpass the target rates while those of standard practice case stay below the reference rates.

This work discusses the FiT scheme implementation for photovoltaics (PVs) in four case study countries - Denmark, Germany, Cyprus, and Spain. A model describing the conditions under which a FiT scheme is led to collapse is also introduced and a parametric analysis towards revealing the sensitivity of the different parameters affecting it, is delivered. The study concludes with significant policy implications that should be considered for future implementation of the scheme. For the prevention of the collapse of the scheme, the tariffs value ought to be determined by each country's government based on a set of influencing factors including the operational, capital and investment costs of each RET, the standard cost of renewable energy (RE) generation and the avoidance cost, which would be regularly reviewed depending on the excess of the annual capacity.

The theoretical premise of the study is the Keynesian view that the nature and the level of development of the banking system and the geography of financial intermediation are imperative to the understanding of regional economic disparities. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis tools used in the analysis indicate the presence of a statistically significant non-random spatial pattern at the provincial NUTS 3 level for the 2006-2013 period. LISA cluster maps reveal that the southeastern provinces of the country constitute a hot spot of credit activity in this period. Moreover, the evolution of financial inequality indices suggests that this clustering has led to a reduction in regional financial disparities across the country over the period in question. The results of econometric conditional convergence analysis suggest regional beta-convergence in terms of Gross Value Added per Capita but no statistically significant link between beta-convergence and the reduction in financial disparities.","[Birkan, Ayse Ozden; Akdogu, Serpil Kahraman] Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,"Birkan, AO (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.",ozden.birkan@yasar.edu.tr; serpil.kahraman@yasar.edu.tr,"Birkan, Ayşe Özden/ABI-6536-2020; Kahraman, Serpil/B-4175-2016","Birkan, Ayşe Özden/0000-0003-2280-9567; kahraman, serpil/0000-0003-4570-1604",,,,,37,4,5,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A variety of products with different features and prices are now available on the market of bottled water, however it is unknown how the retail price of bottled water is affected by its attributes. We thus measured whether, and to what extent, the price of bottled water depends upon its extrinsic (brand, packaging, origin), and intrinsic characteristics (mineral composition). We estimated a hedonic price model using data collected via direct observation of the shelves in various Italian modern retail stores. Our results show that bottled water is highly differentiated and its retail price is mainly affected by extrinsic characteristics.

Demand response is one of the new developments in the field of electricity which is meant to engage consumers in improving the energy consumption pattern. We used Teaching & Learning based Optimization (TLBO) and Shuffled Frog Leaping (SFL) algorithms to propose an optimization model for consumption scheduling in smart grid when payment costs of different periods are reduced. This study conducted on four types residential consumers obtained in the summer for some residential houses located in the centre of Tehran city in Iran: first with time of use pricing, second with real-time pricing, third one with critical peak pricing, and the last consumer had no tariff for pricing. The results demonstrate that the adoption of demand response programs can reduce total payment costs and determine a more efficient use of optimization techniques.

Several conservation practices reduce N export, but cost estimates for these practices are often lacking, which can inhibit decisions by farmers and policy-makers. Many practices are eligible for cost-share funds from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), but these programs do not usually cover the full cost, and so farmers need to be able to approximate their share of costs. In addition, cost estimates may help the USDA to set priorities and make programmatic decisions. We address lack of cost information by estimating the direct implementation costs and USDA program costs for three agricultural conservation practices: wetlands, cover crops, and two-stage ditches, over 10 and 50 year time horizons. We then compare these costs to the N removal effectiveness of each practice, in $ kg N-1 removed. Wetlands were the most cost-effective practice (in $ kg N-1 removed) over both time horizons. Over 50 years, the two-stage ditch ranked second in cost-effectiveness and cover crops were least cost-effective, while over 10 years, cover crops were second and two-stage ditches were least cost-effective. Finally, we note that these practices need not be used in isolation, but can be implemented simultaneously to maximize N removal. Overall, our analysis suggests that careful implementation can cost-effectively mitigate N pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our main finding is that although most of the regional determinants used in previous studies analysing developed countries are also relevant here, there is a need for additional explanatory variables that proxy for the specificities of developing economies (e.g., poverty, informal economy and idle capacity). We also find evidence of a core-periphery pattern in the spatial structure of entry that seems to be mostly driven by differences in agglomeration economies. Since regional policies aiming to attract new firms are largely based on evidence from developed countries, our results raise doubts about the usefulness of such policies when applied to developing economies.","[Daniela Cala, Carla] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Funes 3250, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina; [Manjon-Antolin, Miguel; Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, CREIP, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain; [Manjon-Antolin, Miguel; Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, QURE, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain; [Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria] IEB, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Catalonia, Spain",National University of Mar del Plata; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Calá, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Funes 3250, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina.",dacala@mdp.edu.ar; miguel.manjon@urv.cat; josepmaria.arauzo@urv.cat,"Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/D-6612-2013; Manjon, Miguel/L-5809-2014","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria/0000-0002-3801-223X; Manjon, Miguel/0000-0002-6291-9480; Cala, Carla Daniela/0000-0001-7294-5837","CICYT [SEJ2010-19088/ECON, SEJ2010-16934/ECON]; Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia i Politiques Publiques; Catalan Government [2009-SGR-322]",CICYT(Consejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT)Spanish Government); Xarxa de Referencia d'R+D+I en Economia i Politiques Publiques; Catalan Government,"We are grateful to A.

To test for the existence of regional spillovers, we construct a weight matrix that takes into account the relative importance of the neighbouring ports, as well as the quality of port infrastructure in destination countries.

We examine how people's demographic characteristics and psychological factors affect their direct and indirect energy curtailment behaviors at home, as well as the different effects of these antecedents. Results suggest that people with high sense of environmental responsibility and curtailment attitude are more likely to engage in both direct and indirect energy curtailment actions. Generally, indirect energy curtailment behavior is more strongly related to psychological and socio-demographic factors than direct behavior, and these socio-demographic factors vary for direct and indirect behaviors. Interesting patterns emerged with respect to gender, age, family structure, family income, and level of education. Results indicate that strengthening publicity and education to increase environmental awareness among Chinese urban residents would be effective in reducing household energy consumption, especially when the said measures target a specific population and specific behaviors.

Along these developments, the balance between supply and demand becomes more challenging as the generation of wind and solar power is volatile, and flexibility of supply and demand becomes valuable. As a consequence, companies in the electric power sector develop new business models that create flexibility through activities of timing supply and demand. Based on an extensive qualitative analysis of interviews and industry research in the energy industry, the paper at hand explores the role of timing-based business models in the power sector and sheds light on the mechanisms of flexibility creation through timing. In particular we distill four ideal-type business models of flexibility creation with timing and reveal how they can be classified along two dimensions, namely costs of multiplicity and intervention costs. We put forward that these business models offer 'coupled services', combining resource-centered and service-centered perspectives. This complementary character has important implications for energy policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the risk aversion behavior of the public toward an NPP accident is considered an important factor when integrating risk aversion into NPP accident cost. In this study, an integrated framework for the external cost assessment of NPP accident that measures the value of statistical life (VSL) and the relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient for NPP accident based on an individual-level survey is proposed. To derive the willingness to pay and the RRA coefficient for NPP accident risks, a survey was conducted on a sample of 1550 individuals in Korea. The estimation obtained a mean VSL of USD 2.78 million and an RRA coefficient of 1.315. Based on the estimation results in which various cost factors were considered, a multiplication factor of 5.16 and an external cost of NPP accidents of 4.39E-03 USD-cents/kW h were estimated. This study is expected to provide insight to energy policy decision-makers on analyzing the economic validity of NPP compared to other energy sources by reflecting the estimated external cost of NPP accident into the unit electricity generation cost of NPP.

We consider the question of how to transition to a meaningful percentage of solar energy in a sustainable manner and which policies are most effective in accelerating adoption. This paper develops a stochastic dynamic model of the adoption of solar PV in the residential and commercial sector under two sources of uncertainty - the price of electricity and cost of solar. The analytic results suggest that a high rate of innovation may delay adoption of a new technology if the consumer has rational price expectations. We simulate the model across alternative rates technological change, electricity prices, subsidies and carbon taxes. It is shown that there will be a displacement of incumbent technologies and a widespread shift towards solar PV in under 30 years - and that this can occur without consumer incentives and carbon pricing. We show that these policies have a modest impact in accelerating adoption, and that they may not be an effective part of climate policy. Instead, results demonstrate that further technological change is the crucial determinant and main driver of adoption.

(2014) should be revised and provided an alternative approach, which they considered to be more consistent with the definition of the rebound effect. However, in this comment, we do not find a valid correction or modification to our original model, because their criticism logic does not originate from the corresponding mechanism in Shao et al. (2014), and their estimation formula has a different benchmark with ours. Moreover, their data samples were also different from ours, generating the incomparable results, and there are some irrational results in the comment. Even based on different estimation formulas in the two studies and using the same estimation method and data sample, the comparison results show that the problem of the estimation formula in our previous study which they claimed does not really exist. We argue that this comment is not consistent with the principle of the rebound effect. Actually, their work can be only regarded as proposing an alternative approach for the estimate of the rebound effect. Therefore, their argument is not enough to overturn our previous study.

Given such economic conditions, Japan's total factor productivity (TFP) requires boosting to achieve competitiveness in regional economies. Although labor productivity is a popular measure for the analysis of productivity and has been a focus of prior studies, TFP's comprehensiveness is a preferable measure. This study measures TFP using regional data from Japan and tests if the convergence of regional TFP disparities can be detected since 1980. The results show that TFP has continually increased and converged to reduce regional disparities over the study period. We perform statistical analysis of the regional convergence in TFP using a stochastic convergence model and find that TFP converged at each region's stationary level, not at the nationwide unique level. These results provide policy implications for Japan's regional economies.","[Otsuka, Akihiro] Socioecon Res Ctr, Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-6-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008126, Japan; [Goto, Mika] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, W9-41,2-12-1, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry - Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Otsuka, A (通讯作者)，Socioecon Res Ctr, Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-6-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008126, Japan.",akihiro@criepi.denken.or.jp; mikagoto@valdes.titech.ac.jp,"Otsuka, Akihiro/I-2976-2014; Goto, Mika/C-9980-2015","Otsuka, Akihiro/0000-0001-7852-4590; Goto, Mika/0000-0001-7214-2233",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K17067]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17067] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We provide a classification of fat tails and discuss the effect of fat-tailed risk on climate policy. One of the main findings is that emissions control may prevent the strong tail-effect from arising, at least under some conditions such as bounded temperature increases, low risk aversion, low damage costs, and bounded utility function. More specifically, the fat-tailed risk with respect to a climate parameter does not necessarily lead to an unbounded carbon tax. In this case, the basic principle of cost benefit analysis maintains its applicability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, this research also uses copula model to inspect the contagious effects between regional housing markets. The main empirical results showthat, first, among the metropolitans under studied, Los Angeles in western region, New York in eastern region and Miami in southern region are the source of shock in their respective region. Second, apart from those in southern region, conditional contagious effects between regional housing markets are dynamic during the study period and there exist obvious contagious effect during the period of global financial crises started from 2008 to 2009. Third, contagious effects are more significant within the same region but less obvious in cross-regional housing markets. We also found that housing price comovement in down markets are rare to observe than housing price comovements in up markets.","[Chiang, Ming-Chu] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",mingchuc@yuntech.edu.tw; ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC101-2410-H-224-037],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We would like to thank Yong-Ren Lai for research assistance.

In order to limit the CO2 emissions in the transport sector, the EU has decided to include the aviation industry in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), from 1st January 2012 with the Directive 101/2008/EC. The aim of this paper is to provide an estimation of the direct costs linked to EU-ETS that the aviation sector is standing, reporting the case of Italy. In details, this work proposes a calculation of the EU-ETS direct costs that Italian airline companies under the scheme, afforded over the period 2012-2014. Then, it presents a forecast of the EU-ETS direct costs for the years 2015-2016, referring to three scenarios related to different hypotheses on emission permit price (low, medium, high bounded scenarios), and on pass-through of these costs onto final passengers.

It affects both capital and risk and it is seen as one of the factors that determine them. On the other side, capital regulation and risk-taking behaviour influenced by it have an impact on efficiency. This paper gives an overview of theoretical and empirical studies that are going to be used on modelling the relationship between efficiency, capital and risk-taking behaviour of commercial banks operating in Albania during the period 2002-2014. Based on previous works worldwide, a three stage model is found to be a proper one for such analysis about Albanian banking system. According to this model: first, the regression of efficiency and variables indicating risk and capital has to be analysed, second capital will be regressed against variables indicating efficiency and risk and in the third stage risk-taking will be regressed against variables indicating efficiency and capital. Based on previous studies related to this issue there are findings of a positive trade off between inefficiency and bank risk-taking (such as US evidences) and also negative one (such as European banks that seem to hold more capital and take on less risk in case of inefficiency). Defined independent factors of efficiency, capital and risk-taking are going to be used on an empirical study, subject of prospective research. To my knowledge there is no previous study on this issue for Albanian banking system. This model enables testing of different hypotheses about risk, capital, efficiency and relationship between them. It is going to respond to the effects that reduction in cost efficiencies might have on future risks of Albanian commercial banks. Furthermore, this model gives the possibility to test the bad management hypothesis and efficiency version of moral hazard hypotheses for targeted banks and banking system. It also responds to the questions whether bank cost efficiency makes the foundation of banks' capital position and risk-taking and also whether there is an evidence of relationships between capital and risk-taking in line with moral hazard hypothesis.

The main aim of the article is to underline the importance of state housing policy as the tool of stimulating demand in the Slovak real estate market. In terms of global financial crises requires the strengthening the purchasing power of the population the application of a number of tools of monetary and fiscal policy. The Slovak government implemented the State Housing Policy Concept to 2020 with the intention to revive the property market. Young people and families gained easier access to funds to ensure own housing. The article describes the state housing policy in Slovak Republic, development of Real Estate Market in Slovakia since the year 1989 and direct and indirect subsidies, which have been applied by the Slovak government in order to stimulate the demand in real estate market. The methods used for writing the article are as following: search of domestic literature related to subject of the paper, description of the most important concepts, fusion as a general scientific method of connecting different parts to a certain whole, induction as a method used to create conclusions of the paper, graphical representation of selected economic indicators. The outcome of the paper is the importance of state housing policy concept in terms of strengthening the purchasing power in the national economy. On the other hand, the government should set more strict rules regarding to providing the loans for citizens. Nowadays, young people and families have quite easy access to obtain the loan for private housing. On the other side, this part of population is able to meet the obligations of bank institutions now and during following years. The government has to think in long term context to avoid the mortgage bubble burst and the formation of empty residential areas.","[Nemcova, Daniela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Nemcova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",danka.nemcova@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,4,6,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-592-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,268,274,,10.7441/dokbat.2016.28,0.0,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6IP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000466741400028,0

However, in the innovation-driven market environment, where firms need to maintain competitive strength, business skills and knowledge play important roles. Despite this difference, the due diligence research continues in traditional areas, e.g., financial history, legal and commercial liabilities, and tax issues. Hence, the problem may arise in acquirers overpaying or mistakenly rejecting a target firm. There is a need for assessing 'Business Capabilities and Human Resources Knowledge' for due diligence in the pre-acquisition phase. Based on a fundamental review of critical factors in mergers and acquisitions, this study seeks to examine the inclusion of this factor in due diligence during pre-acquisition. The research method includes a cross-sectional survey among firms with cross-border acquisition experience. The results of the empirical research provide reasonable support towards the organizational learning theory, suggesting that the more the acquirer learns about the critical factor, Business Capabilities and Human Resources Knowledge, the better the acquisition success. These results highlight the importance of expanding the traditional due diligence view by including this critical factor as the integral part of the pre-acquisition investigation.","[Sacek, Alen; Savrina, Baiba] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Sacek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",alen.sacek@gmail.com,"ŠAVRIŅA, Baiba/ABG-4319-2021","SAVRINA, Baiba/0000-0002-5304-4168",,,,,36,0,0,0,12,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,164,171,,10.12955/cbup.v4.757,0.0,,,8,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000024,0

Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the determinants that affect the commitment among homestay operators in Malaysia such as quality of life attributes, attitudes, community roles and the role of government. This study used a survey method using a questionnaire involving 394 homestay operators throughout Malaysia. The study population comprised of 3,211 homestay operators who were registered with the Ministry of Tourism Malaysia as at December 2011. The sample was selected using probability sampling method through multistage cluster sampling procedure. A total of 396 questionnaires were distributed using face to face method but only 337 questionnaires were used for purposes of data analysis. The finding showed that the level of commitment among homestay operators was moderate. The four determinants of the study namely quality of life attributes, attitudes, role of community and the role of government have had positive relationships and become significant predictors to the commitment of the homestay operators in Malaysia.

The web-based application EkonMOD milk tool was used to examine the relevant association on the farm-level and to calculate the economic consequences. The purpose of the EkonMOD milk application is to assist dairy farms managers and to better understand the dynamics of the dairy herd structure and to improve economically sensible decision-making abilities in Slovak conditions. Feed requirements accounts for 40 % to 70 % of the cost of raising replacement heifers and is generally the greatest expense for milk production. There are several key decision-making levels related to calculating of income over feed cost (IOFC). In order to make this process user friendly, a web-based tool will calculate actual feed costs and amount of feeds per cow per day, daily income from one cow, concentrate feed used to produce 1 kg of milk, yearly IOFC, and allow the comparison.

The chance to work in Britain: matching unemployed people to vacancies in good times and bad, Regional Studies. Giving people the chance to work has been a key justification for welfare reform in Britain over the last 15 years. The approach is underpinned by the belief that there are sufficient vacancies available to absorb the unemployed into the labour market. This paper tests this proposition by using the most comprehensive estimates of vacancies available (from the Employers Skills Surveys) and two measures (narrow and broad) of unemployment, by occupation, geography and time period. It also questions whether current approaches to worklessness in Britain are adequate to the task, given the scale of the challenge.","[Taulbut, Martin; Robinson, Mark] NHS Hlth Scotland, Glasgow G2 6QE, Lanark, Scotland",,"Taulbut, M (通讯作者)，NHS Hlth Scotland, 5 Cadogan St, Glasgow G2 6QE, Lanark, Scotland.",martintaulbut@nhs.net,,,,,,,55,11,11,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One of the difficulties faced is the imbalance between the competing aims of economics, politics and the environment which form the trilemma of energy policy. This article advances that this energy trilemma can be resolved through energy justice. Energy justice develops the debate on energy policy to one that highlights cosmopolitanism, progresses thinking beyond economics and incorporates a new futuristic perspective. To capture these dynamics of energy justice, this research developed an Energy Justice Metric (EJM) that involves the calculation of several metrics: (1) a country (national) EJM; (2) an EJM for different energy infrastructure; and (3) an EJM which is incorporated into economic models that derive costs for energy infrastructure projects. An EJM is modeled for China, the European Union and the United States, and for different energy infrastructure in the United Kingdom. The EJM is plotted on a Ternary Phase Diagram which is used in the sciences for analyzing the relationship (trilemma) of three forms of matter. The development of an EJM can provide a tool for decision-making on energy policy and one that solves the energy trilemma with a just and equitable approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, Fujiki and Hsiao (Disentangling the effects of multiple treatments-measuring the net economic impact of the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. IMES Discussion Paper 2013-E-3. Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, 2013) concluded that the effects from the event were only short-lived and the persistent decline of the Hyogo economy had come from structural change of the economy. In order to investigate the disaster-induced structural changes further, this paper aimed to analyze the extent to and the composition of the structural change, based on the input-output framework. While the previous study (Okuyama in Econ Syst Res 26(1):98-117, 2014) lacked the 1995 data and was inclined toward a longer-run analysis, this paper examined immediate structural changes after the event employing the estimated 1995 input-output tables for the damaged region based on the observed macroeconomic data and with a set of different assumptions (Ashiya and Jinushi in Kokumin Keizai Zasshi 183(1):79-97, 2001). The results show that the significant structural changes were observed in the damaged region and that many manufacturing sectors tightened the regional interindustry linkages, whereas service sectors weakened their regional linkages in the aftermath. In addition, the assumptions of how the reconstruction demands would have been leaked out appear to make some critical differences in the results.","[Okuyama, Yasuhide] Univ Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8028577, Japan",University of Kitakyushu,"Okuyama, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8028577, Japan.",okuyama@kitakyu-u.ac.jp,,"Okuyama, Yasuhide/0000-0003-1602-996X",,,,,22,6,6,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The underlying moral reasoning is often hard to extract from the public's rhetoric, and economists often claim that the objections are due to misunderstandings. In this paper we test experimentally one possible objection to trading emission rights: that selling pollution rights is objectionable because it involves trade in the right to do something wrong. The experiment is phrased in a neutral language to avoid invoking subjects' prior attitudes to trading pollution permits. In the experiment, subjects earn money from using stickers that inflict losses on others. After the initial rounds, the use of stickers is limited and the rights to use stickers are tradable. We observe no reluctance to trade these rights compared to a control treatment with identical incentives but no externalities. In a final stage, subjects vote on whether stickers should be tradable or not. Subjects in both treatments are almost unanimous in the support to trade. A majority of third party subjects asked to judge the experimental procedures, however, indicated that the market made the use of stickers seem more moral. A post experiment survey showed that our subject pool had a negative attitude to real life trade of emission quota. The experiment finds no indication that this attitude is due to a concern over tradable quotas legitimizing morally objectionable actions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper surveys the challenges of resource exploitation and use, reflecting that as we exploit the most readily and cheapest resources, and extraction technology, available at the time, so the marginal returns of each tend to decline as the highest quality is depleted, costs rise, and alternatives are increasingly sought. There are few resources where this is truer than the various forms of energy which have been exploited down the ages. Many complex societies in the past have failed to make a successful transition, and the historic record demonstrates clearly the inadequacies of Solow-type growth theory. Scenarios of global energy prospects for the 21st Century need to consider the past and, in the light of it, ask whether the end of the Anthropocene Age is in sight or whether some kind of Promethean leap will come to the rescue.

It divides this discussion into six distinct segments: resources and expenditures, stakeholder involvement and collaboration, testing and maintenance, control and knowledge management, adaptability of designs, and customization and marketing. The study finds that both Vestas and SWP, despite their corporate and cultural differences, utilize the same elements of closed and open styles. It lastly suggests that the notion of style itself may challenge certain assumptions held by scholars about managing the research and innovation process. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Such policies can incentivize energy efficiency by requiring or encouraging electricity providers to meet a certain percentage of their demand through energy efficiency measures. North Carolina's portfolio standard is used as an in-depth case study to identify factors that are then compared across all 36 states that include energy efficiency as part of a portfolio requirement or goal. The main finding of this study is that state portfolio standards tend to emphasize demand-side energy efficiency, or energy efficiency on the customer's side of the electricity meter, and only rarely incentivize a full range of both demand-side and supply-side efficiency changes. As a result, the amount of energy efficiency and climate change mitigation benefits that are likely to result from this type of portfolio standard policy tool are limited. From this analysis, lessons are drawn out for crafting stronger portfolio standards that incentivize a wider range of efficiency changes across electricity networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Even when employing experimental data, assessing the impact of a treatment is often complicated by the presence of sample selection (outcomes are only observed for a selected group) and noncompliance (some treatment group individuals do not receive the treatment while some control individuals do). We address both of these identification problems simultaneously and derive nonparametric bounds for average treatment effects within a principal stratification framework. We employ these bounds to empirically assess the wage effects of Job Corps (JC), the most comprehensive and largest federally funded job training program for disadvantaged youth in the United States. Our results strongly suggest positive average effects of JC on wages for individuals who comply with their treatment assignment and would be employed whether or not they enrolled in JC (the always-employed compliers). Under relatively weak monotonicity and mean dominance assumptions, we find that this average effect is between 5.7% and 13.9% 4years after randomization, and between 7.7% and 17.5% for non-Hispanics. Our results are consistent with larger effects of JC on wages than those found without adjusting for noncompliance.","[Chen, Xuan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Flores, Carlos A.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Renmin University of China; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xchen11@ruc.edu.cn; cflore32@calpoly.edu,,,Orfalea College of Business at California Polytechnic State University,Orfalea College of Business at California Polytechnic State University,"Detailed comments from the Editor, Associate Editor, and three anonymous referees greatly improved the article and are gratefully acknowledged.

Unlike the existing Gaussian QMLE, Laplacian QMLE, generalized non-Gaussian QMLE, or LAD estimator, our Pearsonian QMLE (PQMLE) captures not just the heavy-tailed but also the skewed innovations. Under strict stationarity and some weak moment conditions, the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the PQMLE are obtained. With no further efforts, the PQMLE can be applied to other conditionally heteroscedastic models. A simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the PQMLE. Two applications to four major stock indexes and two exchange rates further highlight the importance of our new method. Heavy-tailed and skewed innovations are often observed together in practice, and the PQMLE now gives us a systematic way to capture these two coexisting features.","[Zhu, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Math, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Wai Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Hong Kong,"Zhu, K (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Math, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",kzhu@amss.ac.cn; hrntlwk@hku.hk,"Li, Wai Keung/AAL-7193-2020; Li, Wai/I-7954-2015; /D-3103-2009","/0000-0001-9149-9289; Zhu, Ke/0000-0001-7093-1220","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government [HKU703711P]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11201459, 11371354, 11571348, 71532013]; Key Lab of Random Complex Structures and Data Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences; AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2014-cjrwlzx-zk]; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Lab of Random Complex Structures and Data Science of Chinese Academy of Sciences; AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences","The authors greatly appreciate the very constructive suggestions and comments of the Editor and two anonymous referees have greatly improved this article.

The sample period is divided, on the basis of the 2008 financial crisis, into pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Results for the pre-crisis period show a lack of risk spillovers between global oil and the Jordanian stock market. After the crisis, however, we find evidence for one-way risk spillover running from the oil market. These findings have implications for the design of appropriate asset allocation and regulatory policies to manage risk spillover effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, by establishing a bottom-up accounting framework, a set of scenarios reflecting the possible future trajectories of energy consumption and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from China's freight transport sector are developed. According to our estimation, GHG emissions from China's freight transport sector were 788 mt CO(2)e in 2013, roughly accounting for 8% of nationwide GHG emissions. Under Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario, energy consumption and GHG emissions in 2050 will be 2.5 and 2.4 times the current levels. GHG emissions will peak by 2045 at the level of 1918 mt CO(2)e. With all major mitigation measures implemented, energy consumption and GHG emissions in 2050 can be reduced by 30% and 32%, respectively. Besides, GHG emissions will peak earlier by around 2035 at a much lower level than under BAU scenario. Our study suggests that in order to keep in pace with China's overall mitigation agenda, aggressive efforts should be made to reduce GHG emissions from freight transport sector.

Yet, congestion induced by renewables would partly offset the merit order effect in the congested zone, unless renewables reduce the need for imports and allow the emergence of prosumers. These congestion effects of renewables are hereby jointly tested with the merit order effect by means of an endogenous regime-switching model wherein a regime corresponds to the observable status (congested/non-congested) of the grid. The model is taken to data from the Italian power exchange, observed in 2012 and 2013, with a focus on the line connecting Sicily with the South zone, a frequent bottleneck in the Italian transmission grid. The results confirm the merit order effect previously detected in the literature and highlight a negative congestion effect, i.e. renewables relieve congestion from Sicily, a systematic importer, but not from the Italian peninsula (the exporting region). This effect is mainly driven by the wind power in-feed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Conversely, multi-level transitions theory argues that governance and the choices of key actors, such as energy companies, government and civil society, drive the transition, not only on the basis of costs. This paper combines the two approaches and presents a cost appraisal of the UK transition to a low-carbon electricity system under alternate governance logics. A novel approach is used that links qualitative governance narratives with quantitative transition pathways (electricity system scenarios) and their appraisal. The results contrast the dominant market-led transition pathway (Market Rules) with alternate pathways that have either stronger governmental control elements (Central Co-ordination), or bottom-up proactive engagement of civil society (Thousand Flowers). Market Rules has the lowest investment costs by 2050. Central Co-ordination is more likely to deliver the energy policy goals and possibly even a synergistic reduction in the total system costs, if policies can be enacted and maintained. Thousand Flowers, which envisions wider participation of the society, comes at the expense of higher investment and total system costs. The paper closes with a discussion of the policy implications from cost drivers and the roles of market, government and society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify three steps in the process: wholesale trade initially develops to cope with balancing needs when the shippers and suppliers segments become more fragmented; once the market becomes more liquid, it turns out to be a second source of gas procurement in alternative to long term contracts; finally, to manage price risk financial instruments are traded. We review in detail the different regulatory measures that must be introduced to create an efficient and functioning wholesale gas market. Finally, we analyze the evolution of gas hubs in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy in terms of market rules and market liquidity.

J. Sense of place and willingness to pay: complementary concepts when evaluating contributions of cultural resources to regional communities, Regional Studies. While the economics literature recognizes the limitations with solely using non-market valuation to understand how cultural resources contribute to their communities, there has been limited use of other approaches. In this study a sense of place scale developed in the environmental psychology literature is used together with contingent valuation to measure the contribution of cultural resources in three regional towns. Using a survey of 354 households, the relationships between visitation of cultural resources, sense of place (place identity and place dependence) and willingness to pay are examined. Visitation to cultural resources is shown to be related to sense of place. In addition, sense of place is demonstrated to be related to willingness to pay. The results imply that the community value of cultural resources is associated with the mix of cultural resources which encourages higher visitation and enhanced sense of place, rather than expenditure on cultural resources alone.","[Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Dowell, David John] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3DD, Dyfed, Wales",Charles Sturt University; Aberystwyth University,"Morrison, M (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, Panorama Ave, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",mmorrison@csu.edu.au; djd5@aber.ac.uk,,"Morrison, Mark/0000-0002-8761-0682",Museums and Galleries NSW; Bathurst Regional Council; Orange City Council; Dubbo City Council,Museums and Galleries NSW; Bathurst Regional Council; Orange City Council; Dubbo City Council,"Funding for this research was provided by Museums and Galleries NSW, Bathurst Regional Council, Orange City Council, and Dubbo City Council.

The methodology created focuses on industrial urban planning procedures and takes into account urban infrastructure in the characterization of GHG emissions. It allows for the implementation of preventive measures based on sustainability design criteria. The methodology was derived for specific industrial activity categories and was tested on a group of municipalities in a province south of Madrid, Spain. The results indicate that the average carbon footprint of industrial activities varies between 137.36 kgCO(2eq)/m(e)(2) and 607.25 kgCo(2eq)/m(e)(2) depending on the activity. Gas and electricity are the most important emissions sources for the most polluting industrial activities (chemical and nonmetal mineral products), while transportation is the most important source for every other activity. Municipalities can have a decisive influence on the industrial carbon footprint because, except for waste management and two industrial activities related to electricity, the majority of reductions can be achieved through urban planning decision variables.

To capture more fully the regional dimensions of economic crisis it is necessary to look also at employment. Using Labour Force Survey (LFS) data on involuntary part-time working and involuntary temporary working a measure of involuntary non-standard employment (INE) is constructed.

Using results from copula theory, we derive a new representation that contains three types of components: (i) the direct contribution of each covariate due to between-group differences in the respective marginal distributions, (ii) several two-way and higher-order interaction effects due to the interplay between two or more marginal distributions, and (iii) a dependence effect accounting for between-group differences in dependence patterns among the covariates. We show how these components can be estimated in practice, and use our method to study the evolution of the wage distribution in the United States between 1985 and 2005. We obtain some new and interesting empirical findings. For example, our estimates suggest that the dependence effect alone can explain about one-fifth of the increase in wage inequality over that period (as measured by the difference between the 90% and the 10% quantile).","Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Rothe, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cr2690@columbia.edu,,,,,,,32,19,21,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

This paper provides an overview of climate risks to energy infrastructures in India and details two case studies - a crude oil importing port and. a western coast railway transporting coal. The climate vulnerability of the port has been mapped using an index while that of the railway has been done through a damage function for RCP 4.5.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Our analysis shows that risk management through adaptation is likely to be very expensive. The system risks can be even greater and might adversely affect energy security and access objectives. Aligning, sustainable development and climate adaptation measures can deliver substantial co-benefits. The key policy recommendations include: i) mandatory vulnerability assessment to future climate risks for energy infrastructures; ii) project and systemic risks in the vulnerability index; iii) adaptation funds for unmitigated climate risks; iv) continuous monitoring of climatic parameters and implementation of adaptation measures, and iv) sustainability actions along energy infrastructures that enhance climate resilience and simultaneously deliver co-benefits to local agents.

The assessment is implemented using a spatial econometric computable general equilibrium approach which integrates spatial econometric techniques with computable general equilibrium models to control for spatial spillover effects. The results found that regional economic impacts of public transportation infrastructure vary substantially by mode and geographic scale. The US highway infrastructure tends to have consistent and dominant impacts on both the US national and regional economy across different geographic scales. The impact of public airport infrastructure tends to be much larger at the national level than state and metropolitan level, whereas the economic contribution of public transit including passenger rail infrastructure tends to be much stronger at the US northeast metro level than the national level of analysis.","[Chen, Zhenhua] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Haynes, Kingsley E.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22201 USA",University of Southern California; George Mason University,"Chen, ZH (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, 3710 McClintock Ave,RTH322, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",zchen7@gmu.edu; khaynes@gmu.edu,"Chen, Zhenhua/B-9693-2017",,,,,,41,25,26,3,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The adoption of EVs depends on consumer preferences, including cost, social status and driving habits, although it is agreed that current and expected costs play a major role. We use a partial equilibrium model that minimizes total energy system costs to assess whether EVs can be a cost-effective option for the consumers of each EU27 member state up to 2050, focusing on the impact of different vehicle investment costs and CO2 mitigation targets. We found that for an EU-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction cap of 40% and 70% by 2050 vis-a-vis 1990 emissions, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are cost-effective in the EU only by 2030 and only if their costs are 30% lower than currently expected. At the EU level, vehicle costs and the capability to deliver both short- and long-distance mobility are the main drivers of BEV deployment. Other drivers include each state's national mobility patterns and the cost-effectiveness of alternative mitigation options, both in the transport sector, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or biofuels, and in other sectors, such as renewable electricity.

The main aim of the paper is to operationalize the culture-based development hypothesis for the existence of a cumulative causation process of cultural impact on Greek local development. To test this hypothesis empirically, we employ an original and uniquely compiled dataset of over 130 economic and social indicators about Greece on a NUTS3 level, assembled from various international and local sources. Employing a combined nonparametric partial-least squares path modelling approach, we find evidence that-in contrast to results from other European countries and the USA-in Greece, culture influences not only the human capital, but also the overall labour force structure. This appears to affect not only the economic productivity, but also the overall quality of life in the locality concerned. These results, based on nonparametric estimations, were confirmed through triangulation with parametric 3SLS and structural equation model tests. The latter use of parametric and nonparametric techniques in a mutually complementary manner is one of the novelties in this contribution.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland",University of Aegean; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Tubadji, A (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece.",atubadji@hotmail.com; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023","Tubadji, Annie/0000-0002-6134-3520; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,64,24,24,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Prior research on project-based organizing in creative industries has emphasized the importance of regionally embedded institutions, creative networks and intermediaries in the development of regional project ecologies. Recently, film and television production in the United States has expanded beyond traditional clusters in Hollywood and New York to new locations in the United States, Canada and overseas, raising important questions about the dynamics of increasingly mobile creative project networks. Using data on the Massachusetts film and television industry between 1998 and 2010, it is argued that regional film offices play an increasingly important role as network intermediaries in connecting mobile creative professionals and project entrepreneurs from outside a cluster with labour pools, service providers and production locations inside a cluster on a project-by-project basis.","[Foster, Pacey; Manning, Stephan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Management & Mkt, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Terkla, David] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Foster, P (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Management & Mkt, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",pacey.foster@umb.edu,,,,,,,67,27,30,2,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Using a restricted-use administrative dataset for West Virginia, we find that, conditional on in-state enrolment and graduation, graduates that received merit aid are less likely than similar non-recipient graduates to work at establishments in the state. These results suggest that the positive influences of merit aid in West Virginia on human capital accumulation stemming from increased in-state college enrolment and graduation are dampened by the locational decisions of the recipients after graduation.","[Leguizamon, J.

More precisely, we test the effect of the foreign direct investment (FDI) and of the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) on the long-term economic growth in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, in a panel framework. For this purpose, we resort to a system-GMM approach, which corrects the endogeneity issues between growth and investment, and we employ a large set of control variables, as the interest rate, the CPI inflation, the unemployment rate, the money in circulation, the exchange rate, the primary energy consumption and the level of education. The analyzed time-span is 2005-2012 and the sample includes 13 CEE countries, namely Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. We find that both direct and portfolio investments exert an influence on the long-term economic growth, when we consider equity and investment funds instruments. Our results show that incentive packages should be oriented toward both types of investments. These findings are documented both in the case of inwards and outwards investments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The data for this study were collected through a survey, conducted face to face, with 104 Tunisian manufacturing companies chosen from the database constructed by the Agency for the Promotion of Tunisian Industry A.P.I.. In fact, before writing the questionnaire, ten exploratory interviews were conducted with managers from five companies. The survey instrument consists of ideas generated from the literature and interviews which were then pre-tested with ten managers having expertise in intellectual capital and value creation. Following this, three interviews were conducted with three leaders of three companies asking them to express their opinions by completing the draft questionnaire. Their comments were taken into account and integrated into the design of the final questionnaire. The respondents were mainly managers or leaders and controllers. The use of survey results leads us to emphasize the existence of a positive and statistically significant relationship between the components of intellectual capital and value creation in Tunisian manufacturing companies. It is a novel study in the Tunisian manufacturing companies which aim to maximize value by implementing the necessary means and among other, human capital, organizational capital, and relational capital.

As an extension to the most recent methodologies using industry and occupational data on industrial cluster analysis, this paper analyses agglomeration and co-location patterns of core creative activities, considering both 'embedded' (creative professionals working outside the creative sectors) and 'specialized' (creative professionals working in the creative sectors) creative employment. Using location quotients and principal component factor and cluster analyses, applied to all 308 Portuguese municipalities, we found that the geographical agglomeration and co-location patterns of core creative groups differ substantially. The typical arguments sustained by the literature-the tendency of creative industries/employment to agglomerate and co-locate in large metropolises-are only supported in the case of knowledge-intensive activities subjected to Intellectual Property Rights, most notably 'Advertising/Marketing', 'Publishing', 'TV/Radio', and 'Software/Digital Media', densely concentrated and co-located in highly developed, large urban centres, with high levels of human capital. These arguments do not hold for the traditional creative activities of 'Architecture', 'Design/Visual Arts' and 'Crafts', which, although co-located, appear mostly dispersed with small concentrations around intermediate urban centres. 'Teaching/training/research' present quite dispersed geographical patterns with some clusterization around municipalities with tertiary education institutions. 'Film/video/photography' and 'Music/Performing Arts' show some dispersion throughout the Portuguese territory with concentration around small urban centres and in rural areas. It is evident that, from agglomeration to co-location patterns, creative employment reveals heterogeneous characteristics across creative groups.","[Cruz, Sara Santos] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Teixeira, Aurora A.

By using the model of triple helix in the Russian economy, it is necessary to take into account the specifics of the country, which lies in its verticalization management. Consequently, the triple helix model has contradictions in the application of the economic system of Russia, as the main idea of that model is interaction of horizontal links and quality of mutual understanding.

Concerns for approaching the business excellence in both academic and practical manner began to be developed in the 60s. Business excellence for a company were presented and analysed in close connection with: decisions and strategic management, customer care, quality, ethics in management and organizational culture, social responsibility and environmental actions. In theoretical and practical terms, business excellence is treated in several ways, and to achieve this level it requires a plurality of values achieved and maintained on long term. Business excellence does not mean a maximum profit or lower priced products, excellence in business is a complex approach from an economically, technically and socially point of view. Thus, in this paper will be presented the most important contributions in defining and studying business excellence by a number of experts and organizations in the field, such as Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman, Robert Heller, Jim Collins, European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA).

The Korean government has planned to perform a rolling blackout to prevent large-scale blackouts when the electricity supply reserve margin reaches less than 1 million kW This study attempts to estimate the inconvenience cost of household customers from a rolling blackout by using survey data. To this end, we apply a contingent valuation method (CVM) to measure their willingness-to-pay (WTP) in order to avoid a rolling blackout, i.e. the suspension of electricity supply. In this study, we estimate the inconvenience costs stemming from both an unannounced and an announced rolling blackout. As a result, we find that the inconvenience cost of a sudden rolling blackout is estimated at 3900.67 KRW (3.56 USD) per month per household, while that of an announced rolling blackout stands at 3102.95 KRW (2.83 USD). This difference in costs shows that people place value in receiving prior notice of a blackout, and that inconvenience costs of between 166.0 billion KRW (151.6 million USD) and 174.3 billion KRW (159.2 million USD) per year can be reduced nationwide by giving households advance notice of a planned rolling blackout.

This paper examines the natural gas vehicle (NGV) implementation approaches and outcomes in seven countries with diverse experiences in order to gain an understanding of the barriers to the NGV market development in Nigeria. The analysis employs hermeneutic principles to secondary data derived from academic literature, published reports from a variety of international agencies, grey literature, and text from online sources and identifies eight success factors for NGV market development namely: strategic intent, legal backing, learning and adaptation, assignment of responsibilities, financial incentives, NG pricing, consumer confidence, and NG infrastructure. The paper concludes that the principal impediment to NGV market development in Nigeria is the uncoordinated implementation approach and that greater government involvement is required in setting strategic goals, developing the legal and regulatory frameworks, setting of clear standards for vehicles and refuelling stations as well as assigning responsibilities to specific agencies. Short-term low cost policy interventions identified include widening the existing NG and gasoline price gap and offering limited support for refuelling and retrofitting facilities.

The retail food market represents a major area for international traders and local merchants. The total value of the Romanian retail market will reach 26 billion euros in 2014. In 2013, food and non-alcoholic drinks represented, on average, 41.4% of consumption. The fact that Romania joined the EU facilitated the access of European retail companies on the Romanian market. In 2013, a percentage of 53% of the total household expenditure in Romania was made on consumer goods in modern retail formats. The expansion of modern retail chains is felt increasingly by more and more local food stores, which must find new ways to survive on the market. Domestic companies were forced to close their businesses or identify strategies to ensure business continuity. The paper methodology includes statistical databases, scientific publications, market survey report research. The example of the advanced countries from the region, such as Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic may forecast the evolution of the Romanian retail food market. A possible scenario for the local food retail sector initiatives would be on the cash & carry Polish model, which turns independent commercial units into modern locations. The organization of independent retailers in the form of an association (retailer cooperative) is another variant. In Romania there is not a powerful alliance of independent stores, such as the CBA in Hungary or the COOP in Slovakia, which are in direct competition with international traders.

It is an area of high environmental importance, as it is characterized by a very rich biodiversity. Because of it's importance, the north part of the gulf is protected by Ramsar Convention and is part of the EU NATURA network. The adjacent plain of Arta (most of which is part of the land part of the park), hosts intensively cultivated, irrigated agricultural land and a number of food processing facilities and though it constitutes a major threat for this ecosystem. As water is plentiful and cheap, most farmers over-irrigate using water by the old open canal scheme that covers part of the plain and from numerous drillings most of which are illegal. The main pathways of agricultural pollutants (fertilizers, pesticides etc) are three rivers (Louros, Aracthos and Vovos) and three main draining canals (Salaoras, Fidokastrou and Neochoriou).

The development power of urban and rural areas lies in the continuous improvement and optimization of the public services. Why the rural development in China is very far behind the development of the urban areas fundamentally is that the public services of China's rural areas are extremely scarce and lag far behind those of the urban areas. A huge productivity is contained in the rural areas in China. The only path of realizing the synchronous construction of a well-off society in both rural and urban areas is constantly improving and optimizing the rural public services and giving a public service security to rural areas, ultimately aiming to protect the excellent, fast and sustainable development of the rural areas.","Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Chinas Ind Secur Res Ctr, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Zhao, YJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Chinas Ind Secur Res Ctr, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-243-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,565,568,,,,,,4,"Economics; Management; Political Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD4UB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361112900105,0

We assume that the top provincial officials desire to maximize their chances of promotion under the Chinese cadre evaluation system. We expect that those with the strongest incentives to perform in order to achieve promotion would work harder to comply with the central government's policy agenda to promote renewable energy. Collecting and testing data on provincial leaders' characteristics, we find that provinces governed by party secretaries who were approaching the age of 65 are associated with significantly higher level of wind installed capacities. This result supports the political tournaments theory of Chinese politics. We also find that better educated party secretaries are likely to be more supportive of renewable energy, implying that education acts to encourage provincial leaders to support the central governments policy.

We present an original model of policy support based on citizens' affinity-to-commons: pathways by which individuals enjoy natural public goods that in turn shape preferences between alternative policy mechanisms. We evaluate this model using a survey of southern California electricity customers, with results indicating the model's utility in predicting public support of EEP. Stronger community ties are associated with preferences for pull-type subsidies, whereas stronger connections to natural commons are linked to support for both pull and push-type sanctions. Findings have implications for coalition building as advocates may engender support for green energy policy by framing sanctions as protecting natural commons, and framing subsidies either in this same way and/or as producing benefits for communities.

The ascendance of EITI is surprising because traditionally, leaders of resource-rich states prefer to tightly control their extractive industries. This paper investigates the underlying causes of EITI membership in order to understand its acceptance, even among some of the most authoritarian regimes. The paper argues that leaders of resource-rich countries use the EITI to consolidate their international prestige as eager reformers, which serves to both maintain and lure foreign investment. The cross-national and interrupted time series analyses reveal that EITI members not only have higher FDI levels compared to non-members, but these investments increase once countries join the initiative.

This paper identifies the factors affecting companies' awareness and perceptions of ETS by conducting a national survey based on an online questionnaire from May to November 2015 in seven carbon trading pilots. The results indicate that companies' attitudes towards the ETS are positively influenced by government regulations and policy, public relations management and estimated economic benefit. Of these, public relations management is the decisive factor and estimated economic benefit is confirmed to be a relatively weak predictor. A company's environmental and energy strategy exerts insignificant effects on its preference for the ETS, although the sampled companies are very willing to save energy and reduce emissions. There exists an inverted U-shape relationship between a company's level of mitigation technologies and its attitudes towards the ETS. The carbon price fails to stimulate companies to upgrade mitigation technologies. The majority of companies treat participation in the ETS only as a means of improving ties with governments, as well as of earning a good social reputation, rather than as a cost-effective mechanism to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

An empirical application is on the spillover effects of state Medicaid spending. Endogeneity of spatial weights matrices comes from the correlation of economic distance and the disturbances in the SAR equation. Common factors control for common shocks to all states and random coefficients may capture heterogeneity in responses. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation is developed. Identification of factors and factor loadings, and model selection issues based upon the deviance information criterion (DIC) are explored. We find that a state's Medicaid related spending is positively and significantly affected by those of its neighbors. Both welfare motivated move and yardstick competition are possible sources of strategic interactions among state governments. Welfare motivated move turns out to be more a driving force for the interdependence and states do exhibit heterogenous responses.","[Han, Xiaoyi] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Dept Publ Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Han, Xiaoyi] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Lee, Lung-Fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Han, XY (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Dept Publ Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Han, XY (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",han.293@buckeyemail.osu.edu; lee.1777@osu.edu,,,,,,,64,21,25,10,47,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Initially a range of values for the unidentified parameters are generated and then the role of sign restrictions is to narrow the range.

Big dependent data are first transformed into functional time series of densities via nonparametric density estimation. We then discuss some tools for exploratory data analysis of the resulting functional time series. The tools employed include K-means cluster analysis and tree-based classification. For modeling, we propose a threshold approximate-factor model and a Hellinger distance autoregressive model for functional time series of continuous densities.

This paper explores the effect of the new mechanism on the profitability of new renewable energy investments with a numerical example. The sensitivity of project profitability to selected factors is studied and the results are compared ceteris paribus to results from a generic feed-in premium case. Furthermore, the paper gives a complete and detailed presentation of the capacity price calculation procedure tied to the support mechanism. The results show that the new Russian renewable energy capacity mechanism offers a significant risk reduction to the investor in the form of dampening the sensitivity to external market factors. At the same time it shields the energy market system from excessive burden of renewable energy support. Even if the complexity of the method is a clear drawback to the detailed understanding of how the mechanism works, the design of the incentive policy could be an appealing alternative also for other emerging economies.

This paper explores the cause of the financing gap in Asia and proposes the use of bond financing to address the financing gap. Specifically, three fixed income instruments, namely local currency denominated (LCY) corporate bonds, asset backed project bonds and financial green bonds, will be assessed. Whilst the potential for these three instruments to mobilize large flows of private sector financing is great, key supportive policies aimed at reducing the capital market bias for conventional power generation technologies and supportive RE policies are required. Another key aspect would be the necessary deepening of local and regional fixed income markets before such capital market instruments are able to play a big role. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of shale gas has not been without problems, and some countries have decided that shale gas production should not proceed until more is known about the accompanying health issues and environmental damages. From experiences in the United States, careful consideration of five critical points relating to shale gas production can form the basis for developing strategies for reducing discharges of pollutants: (1) casing and cementing, (2) handling wastewater, (3) venting and flaring, (4) equipment with air emissions, and (5) seismic events. For each strategy, institutional responses to markedly reduce the risks of harm to people and the environment are identified. These responses offer state and local governments ideas for enabling shale gas resources to be developed without sacrificing public health and environmental quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these hubs appear to be liquid market places fostering gas-to-gas competition, the efficiency of the gas market remains a topic of interest as a fair share of gas is still traded through long-term contracts with prices linked to the oil price while the number of gas suppliers to the European market is limited. In order to assess the efficiency of the gas market, we analyse the day-ahead spot price at the Dutch gas hub over the period 2011-2014. We find that the oil price had a small positive impact on the gas price. Changes in the concentration on the supply side did not affect the movement in gas prices. The availability of gas in storages and the outside temperature negatively influenced the gas price. We also find that the gas price was related to the production of wind electricity. Overall, we conclude that the day-ahead gas prices are predominantly determined by gas-market fundamentals. Policies to further integrate gas markets within Europe may extend this gas-to-gas competition to a larger region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper points out the technical weaknesses of China's current numerical management system. In the process of target disaggregation, the national target cannot be fully disaggregated to local governments, sectors and enterprises without omissions. At the same time, governments at lower levels face pressure for reducing energy intensity that exceeds their respective jurisdictions. In the process of information feedback, information failure is inevitable due to statistical inaccuracy. Furthermore, the monitoring system is unable to correct all errors, and data verification plays a limited role in the examination system. To address these problems, we recommend that the government: use total energy consumption as the primary indicator of energy management; reform the accounting and reporting of energy statistics toward greater consistency, timeliness and transparency; clearly define the responsibility of the higher levels of government.

This problem is known as the energy paradox. The model rationalizes the profitability requirements raised by the irreversibility, the uncertainty and the decrease of costs as a result of learning by doing. In this context, the wait gives investors more visibility and more lower investment costs, which gives them an option value. The representative agent has an interest to postpone its energy saving decision until future benefits increase and equalize its required option value. Formally, we internalize these explanatory factors in a stochastic model where the updated energy saving benefits follows a geometric Brownian motion. To affirm the capacity of the model, we generate simulation results for two equipments for electrical uses. Beyond that, we extend the model to simulate the effects of energy policy instruments to promote adoption of such equipments. Simulations prove that the taxation of energy prices is likely to be more effective than the subsidy for energy-saving equipments. It is also found that the combination of these instruments amplifies the adoption of energy-saving equipments and generates very favorable economic and environmental externalities.

C. Connecting the workshop of the world': intra- and extra-service networks of the Pearl River Delta city-region, Regional Studies. Most research on globalization and city-regions in developing countries has focused on manufacturing activities, disregarding the considerable growth of producer services. Drawing on the Interlocking Network Model, this article presents a first analysis of the intra- and extra-service networks of the Pearl River Delta city-region in China. The central question is how cities in the Pearl River Delta are (re)positioned in the regional urban networks and which national and global cities are their major external connections in the service economy. The result reveals a new pattern of producer-services-led development that differs from the former industrialization experience in the region.","[Zhang, Xu; Kloosterman, Robert C.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, POB AISSR Postbus 15718, NL-1001 NE Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, POB AISSR Postbus 15718, NL-1001 NE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",x.zhang3@uva.nl,,,,,,,52,50,64,4,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Previous literature has examined the effectiveness of government regulation in Texas and Oklahoma in abating these externalities, finding Oklahoma to be more successful in unifying common pools and securing property rights. Using regression discontinuity design, we quantify the impact of regulatory difference between the two states. We find that Oklahoma produces an average of 3361 more barrels of oil over the life of a well, relative to Texas. Given the maturity of the fields in question, the result underscores the continuing importance of addressing common pool externalities even after the primary phase of recovery has largely been completed.

It is important to understand these racks' fuel consumption impacts on both individual vehicles and the national fleet because they are widely used. We estimate the national fuel consumption impacts of roof racks using a bottom-up approach. Our model incorporates real-world data and vehicle stock information to enable assessing fuel consumption impacts for several categories of vehicles, rack configurations, and usage conditions. In addition, the model draws on two new data-gathering techniques, on-line forums and crowd-sourcing. The results show that nationwide, roof racks are responsible for 0.8 parts per thousand of light duty vehicle fuel consumption in 2015, corresponding to 100 million gallons of gasoline per year. Sensitivity analyses show that results are most sensitive to the fraction of vehicles with installed roof racks but carrying no equipment. The aerodynamic efficiency of typical roof racks can be greatly improved and reduce individual vehicle fuel consumption; however, government policies to minimize extensive driving with empty racks if successful could save more fuel nationally.

Drawing on a sample of approximately 192,000 transactions, the capitalisation of energy efficiency ratings into house prices is investigated using two approaches. The first adopts a cross-sectional framework to investigate the effect of EPC rating on price. The second approach applies a repeat-sales methodology to investigate the impact of EPC rating on house price appreciation. Statistically significant positive price premiums are estimated for dwellings in EPC bands A/B (12.8%) and C (3.5%) compared to houses in band D. For dwellings in band E (-3.6%) and F (-6.5%) there are statistically significant discounts. Such effects may not be the result of energy performance alone. In addition to energy cost differences, the price effect may be due to additional benefits of energy efficient features. An analysis of the private rental segment reveals that, in contrast to the general market, low-EPC rated dwellings were not traded at a significant discount. This suggests different implicit prices of potential energy savings for landlords and owner-occupiers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This assessment includes three dimensions. First, we measure how household water consumption reacts to the price change induced by implementing the FCR principle. Second, we provide a measure of the resulting household welfare losses. Third, we evaluate how household water affordability is impacted. This assessment which relies on a household water demand function approach has been conducted for 9 European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). For most of these countries, we show that implementing the FCR principle does not lead to substantial water affordability issues. Bulgaria (and to a lesser extend Estonia and France) is one exception since poor households (i.e. households belonging to the first income decile) have to devote more than 3% of their income for paying their water and wastewater bill under a FCR regime. The fact that water affordability may become an issue under FCR for some countries gives some ground for public authorities to develop specific policies targeted to poor households.

This paper proposes a new three-step method to find delineations that adequately define functional regions with strong interactions within the region and few connections with outside areas based on commuting flows. A graph-theoretical approach is used to create many meaningful delineations for labour market regions in Germany and the modularity concept from network analysis is employed to select the delineation that captures the commuting flows best. As a result, a delineation of 50 German labour market regions that are quite heterogeneous in terms of size is obtained. Using the modularity measure, the current delineation is compared with previous functional delineations.","[Kropp, Per] IAB Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res, Frau V Selmnitz Str 6, D-06110 Halle, Germany; [Schwengler, Barbara] Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Kropp, P (通讯作者)，IAB Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res, Frau V Selmnitz Str 6, D-06110 Halle, Germany.;Schwengler, B (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Per.Kropp@iab.de; Barbara.Schwengler@iab.de,,"Kropp, Per/0000-0003-0927-756X",,,,,52,23,25,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, results from System Generalized Methods of Moments regressions generate stronger responses for (endogenous) wages and labor productivity. First, crime has negative effects on Mexican labor productivity across states during the war on drugs period. Second, increases in expenditures on public security lead to falling labor productivity, which can be interpreted as indirect effects of crime.

Our econometric results provide evidence that US states tend to diversify into new products that use available capabilities from existing economic activities. Also, we find that the impact of product relatedness on product diversification positively depends on the level of several state-specific economic variables (migration flows within states, cluster strength and R&D).

In the future, such subsidies may be reduced or eliminated. From the homeowner's perspective, solar PV is competitive when it can produce electricity at a cost equivalent to the retail electricity rate, a condition sometimes referred to as socket parity. In assessing the economic viability of residential solar PV, most existing literature considers only a few locations and fails to consider the differences in PV system cost and electricity prices that exist across the U.S. We combined insolation data from more than 1000 locations, installation costs by region, and county-level utility rates to provide a more complete economic assessment of rooftop solar PV across the U.S. We calculated the break-even electricity prices and evaluated the reductions in installed costs needed to reach socket parity. Among the scenarios considered, we estimate that only Hawaii has achieved socket parity without the use of subsidies. With subsidies, six states reach socket parity, yet widespread parity is still not achieved. We find that high installation costs and financing rates are two of the largest barriers to socket parity.

This paper empirically investigates drivers and barriers behind homeowners' decisions to switch from a fossil fuel to a renewable RHS in Germany. For this purpose, we draw on data from a 2010 questionnaire survey among owners of existing single-family and duplex houses in Germany that had received a financial grant to install an RHS (i.e. condensing boiler with solar thermal support, heat pump or wood pellet boiler). We show that environmental protection, a lower dependency on fossil fuels, and a higher degree of RHS-related knowledge are key drivers. In contrast, the perceived difficulty of getting used to the system and a misunderstanding of its principal functioning are obstacles for the heat pump. For the wood pellet boiler, perceived barriers include the low usability, the labor-intensive operation, and the systems' fault liability. Hence, a higher replacement rate requires the willingness to relinquish old habits and perceptions of how an RHS works and operates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The days of vertical integration are over. Product development, manufacturing and other activities once done by single firms are now fields of collaboration. This raises questions about the spatial aspects of interfirm collaboration. Firms have partners in their direct environment, at a distance or in between, which means that traditional views on regional economic development no longer apply. It also means that a local-global dichotomy does not adequately describe today's economic landscape.

We are also interested in examining how the attributes of enterprise ownership act as a moderating variable for the relationship between government subsidies and R&D investment behavior. Three classical panel data analysis models including the pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) model, the fixed effect model and the random effect model are employed. We find that government subsidies have a significant crowding out influence on enterprises' R&D investment behavior and that the influence is further moderated by the attributes of enterprise ownership. Moreover, a panel threshold regression model is used to demonstrate how the influence of government subsidies on enterprises' R&D investment behavior will change when government subsidies increase. Two thresholds, 0.6% and 10.1%, are identified. We recommend that relevant government departments should motivate enterprise R&D investment behavioral intention by increasing subsidies within a certain range. Different attributes of enterprise ownership should also be considered as part of policy reform and re-structuring relating to government subsidies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While the focus in the former is on the use of mainly national marketing channels and the movement of organic produce more than 60 min from the farm, in the latter greater use is made of local and direct marketing channels to distribute organic food within 30 min of the farm.

The Kosovo economy has only one source of institutional money injected into the economy and that is the banking industry. Bringing back the money of Kosovo Pension and Saving Trust (KPST) to Kosovo would have been a huge injection for the economy to raise GDP and lower unemployment. Since the companies in Kosovo contain a lot of asymmetric information within their financial statements, clearing the way for KPST how to allocate their investments in Kosovo would be through alleviating asymmetric information. The paper stands on the general concepts of the asymmetric information and how to alleviate it within the financial market and particularly within the bond market. The other part of the paper concentrates on theoretical framework how to eliminate asymmetric information for the companies who want to get funding from KPST. Therefore, it is necessary to have healthy banks and better environment to have a sound bond market.

In this study we use a multi-criteria assessment (MCA) supported by Geographical Information System (GIS) to combine already existing information on solar radiation with other geographical factors such as slope, land use, urban extent and population distribution, as well as proximity to the power grid to generate a suitability map for photovoltaic (PV) power plants across the EU at high spatial resolution. A validation exercise showed that the resulting suitability map is a good predictor of appropriate locations for the deployment of PV power plants. The suitability map was in addition compared to the regional distribution of European funds for development of solar energy from the EU Cohesion policy (2007-2013 programme). Regions were classified according their overall suitability for solar energy power systems and the allocated solar investments by the EU Cohesion policy. This analysis allowed to identify potential mismatches between fund allocations and actual regional suitability for solar energy. It is recommended that future fund allocations take into account suitability criteria for solar energy for optimised results of public policies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

As a result, it was not clear to researchers how, why, and in what conditions residents of a destination react to the impacts of tourism. To address these shortcomings, researchers started making use of a number of theories, among which, the Social Exchange Theory (SET) is considered to have made the most important theoretical contribution to studies on residents' perceptions of tourism. This paper critically analyzes the different elements involved in the social exchange process between residents of a destination and the tourism industry. It analyzes the core constructs of the SET and in particular, focuses on power and trust between the actors in the exchange process. The arguments suggest that researchers have failed to integrate these core concepts in a single study to investigate their influence on residents' perceptions of tourism and their support for development. The paper suggests that the power and trust concepts have significant potential in explaining community acceptance of tourism and if this field of study is to be advanced theoretically, then researchers should empirically test these concepts in an integrative framework.

During the study, a total of 471 workers from 12 five star hotels in Alanya districtof Antalya province were contacted. Based on the correlation analysis results, a statistically significant relationship was identified between intrinsic satisfaction and the openness and conscientiousness dimensions. On the other hand, no statistically significant relationship was observed between extrinsic satisfaction and the five-factor personality traits. Furthermore, a statistically significant relationship was also observed between general job satisfaction and the openness and conscientiousness dimensions. Based on the regression analysis, it was determined that the extraversion dimension had a more significant effect than the openness dimension. The extraversion dimension had a negative effect on extrinsic job satisfaction, while the openness dimension had a positive effect.

The results of our pilot study in a Romanian small-to medium-sized enterprise show that leader's behaviors such as enforcing observance of organizational rules, professional objectivity in employee appraisal processes, keeping promises and commitments, fairness, as well as leader's professional competency are essential for achieving higher degrees of trust in intra-organizational relationships. In assuming the inherent limitations of a pilot case study leading to the necessity to further the methodological developments and follow-up studies, our research confirmed obvious relationships between the targeted domains, transformational leadership and trust.

Instances exist already in natural hydro power, biomass generation, wave power, and concentrated solar power. GIES systems have been proposed for wind, nuclear power and they arise naturally in photocatalysis systems that are in development. GIES systems can compare very favourably in both performance and total cost against equivalent non-integrated systems comprising both generation and storage. Despite this, they have not hitherto been recognised as a discrete class of systems. Consequently policy decisions affecting development or demonstration projects and policy approaches concerning low-carbon generation are not fully informed. This paper highlights that policy structures exist militating against the development and introduction of GIES systems-probably to the detriment of overall system good. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This has mainly been driven by increases in the cost of electricity distribution and to a lesser degree in the cost of electricity generation. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is a bipartisan political goal in Australia, will likely deliver further increases in generation costs due to the expected higher cost of low emission technology. Participating in global negotiations on emission reduction targets and designing efficient policy mechanisms have been a major focus of governments over the last several decades. In contrast, managing distribution system costs has received less attention. While there were a number of factors which drove historical increases in distribution costs, management of peak demand growth could help contain or reduce the extent to which consumers, particularly households, experience further increases in distribution costs. The paper demonstrates how different combinations of carbon price and peak demand scenarios could impact future residential and industrial retail electricity prices to 2050 and discusses some behavioural and technological solutions to manage peak demand and potential barriers to their deployment.

In today's ISO-run energy markets, demand bid formats are all separable over time. However, a significant and growing segment of demand can be shifted across time and therefore has no way to bid its true valuation of consumption. We propose additional bid types that allow deferrable, adjustable and storage-type loads to better express their value, and thus elicit demand response in the most natural way - via direct participation in the market. We show that the additional bid types are easily incorporated into the existing market with no technological barrier and that they preserve the market's efficiency and incentive-compatibility properties. Using real market data, we give a numerical demonstration that the extended bid format could substantially increase social welfare, and also present additional insight on storage expansion scenarios.

Historically, China's natural gas prices have been highly regulated with a goal to protect consumers. The old pricing regime failed to provide enough incentives for natural gas suppliers, which often resulted in natural gas shortage. A new gas pricing reform was tested in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in 2011, and introduced nationwide in 2013. The reform is aimed at creating a more market-based pricing mechanism. We show that a substantial progress toward a better predictability and transparency of prices has been made. The prices are now more connected with the international fuel oil and liquid petroleum gas prices. The government's approach for a temporary two-tier pricing when some volumes are still traded at old prices reduced a potential opposition during the new regime implementation. Some limitations of the natural gas pricing remain as it created biased incentives for producers and favors large natural gas suppliers. The pricing reform at its current stage falls short of establishing a complete market mechanism driven by an interaction of supply and demand of natural gas in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a structural time series model to estimate various energy demand and CO2 intensity models that take account of the aforementioned factors. We adopt preferred models from these estimates to analyse how energy demand and CO2 emissions in Nigeria might evolve by generating three different future scenarios to 2025. We find energy efficiency and non-economic factors to influence energy demand and CO2 emissions. The long-run income and price elasticities obtained differ significantly from those in existing studies that have ignored these salient factors. In a business-as-usual scenario, the results indicate that energy demand will continue to grow. Consequently, present policies do not sufficiently mitigate aggregate CO2 emissions in Nigeria. The lesson for policy makers is that the extant policies introduced to restrain CO2 emissions (from a production perspective) have to be combined with new policies that influence consumers' lifestyles and behaviours, develop energy efficient technologies and apply low tariffs on imported energy efficient appliances, to drive down CO2 emissions from a consumption perspective.

This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of these factors and to inform the design of measures to improve energy efficiency in road freight transport. The paper uses both annual single-period and chained multi-period multiplicative LMDI-II decomposition analysis. The results suggest that the decrease in the energy intensity of Spanish road freight in the period is explained by the change in the real energy intensity index (lower energy consumption per tonne-kilometre transported), which is partially offset by the behaviour of the structural index (greater share in freight transport of those commodities the transportation of which is more energy intensive). The change in energy intensity is analysed in more depth by quantifying the contribution of each commodity through the attribution of changes in Divisia indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate these issues, a Germany-wide written survey was conducted and the completed questionnaires of 775 respondents analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Of 29 different variables influencing the purchase of a heating system, 12 statistically significant variables have been identified which characterize the owners of oil heating, a heat pump, gas heating and wood pellet heating. The membership of different ecological clusters primarily segregates the owners of a specific heating system, but the assessment of the different combustibles also plays a major role in this context. Suppliers of heating systems can use the results of this study to fine-tune their marketing strategies. With respect to policy issues only limited room for additional economic incentives can be identified to promote replacement of fossil-fuel based heating systems in favor of renewable ones.

Similar policies indicate that in practice, these two concepts are usually perceived as mutually exclusive. Furthermore, evidence in the literature regarding the relationship between R&D and energy efficiency is still highly limited. This exploratory study aims to address this gap by investigating the link between innovation practices and energy efficiency through a multiple case study of 30 foundries in Northern Italy. We analysed the firms' innovativeness, measured by internal R&D and Open Innovation practices (inbound and outbound), and energy efficiency, measured by specific energy consumption, level of adoption of energy-efficient technologies and barriers to energy efficiency. The results seem to show that those foundries complementing internal R&D with inbound practices have a higher level of energy efficiency, a higher level of adoption of available technologies, and a lower perception of barriers to efficiency improvements. This finding suggests that diversifying innovation practices could lead to better performance with respect to all three indicators of energy efficiency analysed. This study contributes to understanding how more innovative firms can be more energy efficient, providing interesting highlights for managers and policymakers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis that well-crafted and well-enforced regulation would benefit both the environment and the firm was originally proposed by Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995). To date, the literature has analyzed the impact of environmental regulation on innovation and on productivity mostly in separate analyses and focusing on the USA. The few existing contributions on Europe study the effect of environmental regulation either on green innovation or on performance indicators such as exports. We instead look at overall innovation and productivity impacts. First, focusing on overall innovative activity allows us to account for potential opportunity costs of induced innovations. Second, productivity impacts are arguably the most relevant indicators for the strong PH. As a proxy of environmental policy stringency we use pollution abatement and control expenditures (PACE), one of the few sectoral level indicators available. We remedy upon its main drawback, namely potential endogeneity, by adopting an instrumental variable estimation approach. We find evidence of a positive impact of environmental regulation on the output of innovation activity, as proxied by patents, thus providing support in favor of the weak PH. This result is in line with most of the literature. On the other front, we find no evidence in favor of the strong PH, as productivity appears to be unaffected by the degree of pollution control and abatement efforts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The interaction of these resources is particularly important in China, where water resources are unevenly distributed, with limited availability in coal-rich regions. The 3 Red Lines water policies were introduced in 2011; one of their aims is to reduce industrial water use, of which the energy sector is a part. This paper analyses current water withdrawals and consumption for all energy processes and assesses the sector's compliance with the industrial water policy under different scenarios, considering potential future policy and technological changes. The results show that future energy plans could conflict with the industrial water policy, but the amount of water used in the energy sector is highly dependant on technology choices, especially for power plant cooling. High electricity demand in the future is expected to be met mainly by coal and nuclear power, and planned inland development of nuclear power presents a new source of freshwater demand. Taking a holistic view of energy and water-for-energy enables the identification of co-benefits and trade-offs between energy and water policies that can facilitate the development of more compatible and sustainable energy and water plans.

This paper explores the future development of China's transportation sector in terms of service demands, final energy consumption, and CO2 emissions, and their interactions with global climate policy. This study develops a detailed China transportation energy model that is nested in an integrated assessment model Global Change Assessment Model (GCAIVI) to evaluate the long-term energy consumption and CO2 emissions of China's transportation sector from a global perspective. The analysis suggests that, without major policy intervention, future transportation energy consumption and CO2 emissions will continue to rapidly increase and the transportation sector will remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Although carbon price policies may significantly reduce the sector's energy consumption and CO2 emissions, the associated changes in service demands and modal split will be modest, particularly in the passenger transport sector. The analysis also suggests that it is more difficult to decarbonize the transportation sector than other sectors of the economy, primarily owing to its heavy reliance on petroleum products.

Is specialization good for regional economic development?, Regional Studies. Debates about urban growth and change often centre on specialization. However, arguments linking specialization to metropolitan economic development contain diverse, and sometimes conflicting, claims. Is it better to be highly specialized or diversified? Does specialization refer to the absolute or relative scale of an activity in a region? Does specialization have static or evolutionary effects? This paper investigates these questions in theoretical and empirical terms. By analysing local agglomerations over time, it is found that growing absolute specialization is positively linked to wages, while changes in relative concentration are not significantly associated with wage dynamics.","[Kemeny, Thomas; Storper, Michael] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kemeny, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.e.kemeny@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,120,136,2,107,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We introduce importance sampling as a technique for integrating elicitation data and large IAMs into decision making under uncertainty models. We show that it is important to include both parts of this equation the prospects for technological advancement and the interactions of the technologies in and with the economy. We find that investment in energy technology R&D is important even in the absence of climate policy. We illustrate the value of considering dynamic two-stage sequential decision models under uncertainty for identifying alternatives with option value. Finally, we consider two frameworks that incorporate ambiguity aversion. We suggest that these results may be best used to guide future research aimed at improving the set of elicitation data.

In a treatment replicating water scarcity conditions, convexities in production make that substantial efficiency gains can be obtained by deviating from equal sharing, leading to an equity-efficiency trade-off. In a repeated game setting, it becomes possible to reconcile efficiency with equity by rotating the person who receives the largest share, but such a strategy requires a longer run perspective. Correlating experimental data from an irrigation game with individual time preference data, we find that less patient irrigators are less likely to use a rotation strategy.","[Van Campenhout, Bjorn] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI Kampala, Kampala, Uganda; [D'Exelle, Ben] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lecoutere, Els] Univ Ghent, Conflict Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of East Anglia; Ghent University,"Van Campenhout, B (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI Kampala, Plot 15,East Naguru Rd,POB 28565, Kampala, Uganda.",b.vancampenhout@cgiar.org; b.dexelle@uea.ac.uk; els.lecoutere@ugent.be,"Lecoutere, Els/V-9654-2019; Lecoutere, Els/AAW-3121-2021","Lecoutere, Els/0000-0002-1025-742X; Lecoutere, Els/0000-0002-1025-742X",Institute of Development Policy and Management (University of Antwerp); Ghent University; MICROCON; Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; Incomet; MuCoBa,Institute of Development Policy and Management (University of Antwerp); Ghent University(Ghent University); MICROCON; Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO); Incomet; MuCoBa,"We kindly acknowledge the financial support received from the Institute of Development Policy and Management (University of Antwerp), Ghent University, MICROCON and the Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek.

A large body of literature dealing with energy related problems has focused on reducing greenhouse gases emissions at an engineering scale. In contrast, the minimization of climate change at a wider macroeconomic level has so far received much less attention. We investigate here how to mitigate global warming by performing changes in an economy. To this end, we make use of a systematic tool that combines three methods: linear programming, environmentally extended input output models, and life cycle assessment principles. The problem of identifying key economic sectors that contribute significantly to global warming is posed in mathematical terms as a bi-criteria linear program that seeks to optimize simultaneously the total economic output and the total life cycle CO2 emissions. We have applied this approach to the European Union economy, finding that significant reductions in global warming potential can be attained by regulating specific economic sectors. Our tool is intended to aid policy makers in the design of more effective public policies for achieving the environmental and economic targets sought. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that there was a CO2 emission Kuznets curve seen in China. Environmental regulation had a significant moderating effect on the curve, and the inflection of CO2 emissions could come substantially earlier under stricter environmental regulation. Meanwhile, the impact of technical progress on the low-carbon economic development path had a longer hysteresis effect but restrained CO2 emission during its increasing stage and accelerated its downward trend during the decreasing stage which was conducive to emission reduction. Strict environmental regulation could force the high-carbon emitting industries to transfer from the eastern regions to the central or the western regions of China, which would make the CO2 Kuznets curve higher in its increasing stage and lower in its decreasing stage than that under looser regulation. Furthermore, energy efficiency, energy structure, and industrial structure exerted a significant direct impact on CO2 emissions; we should consider the above factors as essential in the quest for low-carbon economic development.

In developed countries it is evident that the progress of politics and democracy experienced the processes of tolerance, majority rules and minority rights, conflict solving, negotiation, and benefits assimilation. The early stage of the initiation of the Thai local administration, under the District Administration Act of the year 1994 has also caused the conflicts and violence to life and properties, as well as crimes and corruptions of those involved with local politicians. However, the experience from the past two decades has led to the development of communities and local politicians resulting in the development of public utilities including roads, water supply, water sources, public spaces, public properties, and local economy. The centralized phenomena, including the number of votes in the elections, protests, and silence during the coup d'etat, reflected the failure and weaknesses of the national administration. Thus, the development of local administration can be considered as a good lesson in solving conflicts and violence in the nation's politics. (C) The Authors.

Monitoring drought is a task that requires the combination of various data sources and indicators in order to provide a comprehensive picture of this complex natural event and its manifold impacts. The monitoring of rainfall and temperature for periods over 40 years, combined with soil moisture modelling gives insight in the development of a creeping drought disaster. The further combination of such information with satellite observations measuring vegetation response allows identifying actual and potential damage to the vegetation canopy. In order to give the audience a quick insight in the development of a drought disaster the EDO team developed a Combined Drought Indicator showing the progression of a rainfall deficit through the hydrological cycle.

This has been a fundamental rule for decades and fulfilled even by newer data systems (i.e. NoSQL data stores). However Hadoop blurs the distinction between logical and physical data layers. Consequently it might be considered a step back in the database community. In this paper we examine how and why the physical and logical models are tightly coupled in Hadoop, the way Hive fills the logical-physical gap. We compare Hive layer/framework data model with the classical relational approach.

We assume that between employment and performance of the Slovak economy in individual periods is a strong dependence. This analysis confirmed our assumption. The productivity growth of the Slovak economy is directly proportional related to the ability of enterprises to respond successfully to new challenges in the field of innovation and the optimal use of productive resources.

This fact is not taken into account in multiple management systems. Traditional inventory models at the same time assume that a retailer pays for the goods the moment they are received. Nowadays, however, it is becoming a common practice that a supplier offers a retailer the option to pay for the goods with a certain delay. If the retailer is not able to meet his obligations within the deadline, he is charges an interest. In this study we introduce a newly constructed suitable model which enables a retailer to set an optimal price of deteriorating goods under permissible delay in payments, and to determine the maximum repayment term. We considered a deterministic inventory model with time-dependent demand, holding costs variable in time where deterioration is directly proportional to the time. The model is based on the assumption of time-dependent demand and has been developed for deteriorating goods. The paper further analyses a situation in which the retailer sell all the goods in time, and a situation in which the deadline was not met. Further assumption is that the inventory is depleted only by demand. The scientific aim is to verify if such an optimizing problem can be solved. Theoretical results are illustrated with numerical example for the model. Results show that the developer model is capable of solving the theoretical problem illustrated by an example. It helps to the retailer to set the selling price and the replenishment interval in order to maximize profit. The authors of the paper used methods of analysis and synthesis, and the method of mathematical analysis (differential calculus of multivariable functions, solution of ordinary differential equations, Taylor series). The model suggested in the paper can be expanded in the future. One option is generalization of the model, allowing for the lack of goods, bulk discounts, time value of money, inflation etc. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The obtained results clearly indicated statistically insignificant differences in target companies' performances before and after M&A activity. The same results, i.e. statistically insignificant differences, were obtained even when performance of target companies (after acquisition) was compared to the peer companies.

EC/1305/2013. Within a generalized rural development context, agriculture plays numerous roles; in Cyprus three sectors other than the production of food and fiber are particularly affected: the environment, including the management of water reserves as water is the scarcest resource on the island and irrigation accounts for more than 70% of the total water consumption, rural amenities, through the protection of the agricultural cultural heritage and the livelihood of rural areas, and the continuation of the farming profession, which is endowed with non-use values. This study presents the findings of a survey regarding the degree to which Cypriots are interested in the aspects of life on the island which are affected by the multifunctional character of agriculture. Using Likert-scale questions, 300 respondents were interviewed concerning their opinions and attitudes towards four of these aspects: environmental quality, management of water resources, rural amenities and the maintenance of the farming profession. The analysis indicates that Cypriots are aware of the roles that agriculture plays. Then, in order to examine the validity of this conceptual framework of multifunctionality, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed. The results of the CFA revealed that Cypriots incorporate these four aspects within the same framework, thus understanding the distinct effects of multifunctionality on their everyday life. The results of this study can be used in the implementation of Reg. EC/1305/2013, as they reflect public preferences concerning the orientation of agriculture. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This was achieved by joining three scientific research areas: earth observation (EO), catchment modelling and meteorology. Data from these different sources were integrated through an interface platform, which provides tailored services to the water manager, including support for irrigation activities in Nestos river plain (Greece) and early flood warning in Rijnland (The Netherlands). The platform includes tools for visualization and presentation of short-term prediction of the meteorological and hydrological conditions in maps and charts. It also allows the users to make analysis of time series of data, definition of warning alarms, and other tools useful for the water managers. MyWater's users played a key role, by defining the requirements during the development phase, and providing evaluation feedback towards the project's end. The aim of this work is to present the feedback from the users, after they had been trained on using MyWater's platform and information services. Participants were asked to reflect on the platforms' ease of use, speed performance. Secondly whether the data is easily to be retrieved and the catalogue is clear enough, and to what extend the platform could be customized. Results show that 75% of the questions concerning the Platform were answered with Good or Excellent, while 25% was marked as Average. Few participants raised their concern on the speed / performance they experienced with the platform, and indeed the internet band-width required for optimal use of the platform was not met all the time during the evaluation phase. With respect to the services offered, some participants indicated they would appreciate MyWater also to focus on water quality (e.g. salinity problems in irrigation water) and pollution.

This has led to recent discussions for a better market integration of RES-E. The paper examines how competing actors and their ideas on market integration developed new services for direct marketing according to their respective origins and tried to shape the regulatory framework. The paper analyses this process and explains the current shape of the field of direct marketing. Medium-sized structured actors, who favoured RES-E integration via the conventional wholesale power markets, and who formed early close coalitions with RES-E power producers at the same time, have been most successful in terms of market shares. Moreover, they have been very successful for different reasons in building-up coalitions with governance units and influencing the field rules and routines. Based on those findings, the paper will conclude with some policy advices for the future adjustment of the current regulative frameworks. As long as there is no evidence of how RES-E can be integrated most effectively and efficiently, policies should maintain a competition between different direct marketing strategies to find out which strategies serve the best in terms of achieving a successful energy transition.

To that end, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, Brent oil prices, the US dollar, the American Dow Jones Industrial Index, Wholesale Price Index, Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 Index, and monthly average time deposit interest rates were selected as the factors with possible impact on gold prices; and relevant econometric models were constructed. In the model that delivered the best results among all the models estimated by using the Engle-Granger two-step estimation procedure, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices were found to be the single and most important variable that influences the gold prices on the Istanbul Gold Exchange. Estimation of the gold prices on the Istanbul Gold Exchange in the study was done by using ARCH models. The analysis results revealed that the EGARCH(1,1) model is the best model. Using this model, it was concluded that gold prices on the Istanbul Gold Exchange are negatively influenced by the Dow Jones Industrial Index, positively influenced by London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, also positively influenced by the Wholesale Price Index, and negatively influenced by the volatility of the gold prices on the Istanbul Gold Exchange, which was estimated using ARCH models (C) 2014 The Authors.

To address this need, this study presents a web survey that used a between-subjects factorial experimental design to explore the views of 325 U.S. adults, who were asked about their experiences with earthquakes; risk perceptions related to different causes of earthquakes (e.g., natural versus induced); and acceptability of earthquakes depending on the benefits, beneficiaries, and decision making process. The results found that participants had more negative feelings toward induced versus naturally occurring earthquakes. Although they judged no earthquake as acceptable, participants rated induced earthquakes significantly less acceptable than naturally occurring ones. Attributing the benefits to the provision of renewable energy or climate change mitigation did not increase induced earthquake acceptability, and no particular beneficiary made earthquakes more acceptable, although private companies as beneficiaries made earthquakes less acceptable. Finally, induced earthquake acceptability was significantly higher when people believed that people like them had a voice in the decision to implement the technology that caused the earthquake, underscoring the importance of public engagement in the development of energy technologies.
