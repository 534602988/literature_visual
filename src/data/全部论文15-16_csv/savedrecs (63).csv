One additional benefit of higher MLDAs may be that they improve health outcomes among infants born to young mothers. We estimate the impact of MLDAs on infant health in the USA by comparing birth outcomes among 14-20 year old mothers who were exposed to different MLDAs because of when and where they gave birth. Infants born to mothers who were between the ages of 21 and 24 years are included as a control group. We find that low MLDAs are associated with very small birth weight reductions, but have a little relationship with other traditional measures of infant health. We find compelling evidence, however, that a low MLDA increases the probability of a female birth, which suggests that restricting alcohol access to young mothers may reduce fetal deaths.

We use this approach to develop an accurate estimator for the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). We demonstrate the method in Monte Carlo simulations and implement it on U.S. data.

Two easily implemented nonparametric F-tests are proposed. The limit distribution of these predictive tests is nuisance parameter free and holds for a wide range of predictors including stationary as well as non-stationary fractional and near unit root processes. Asymptotic theory and simulations show that the proposed tests are more powerful than existing parametric predictability tests when deviations from unity are large or the predictive regression is nonlinear.

In this case, the standard dynamic panel estimators fail to provide consistent estimates of the parameters. The novelty of our approach is that we introduce new parameters to represent the unobserved covariances between the instruments and the factor component of the residual; these parameters are estimable when N is large. Some important estimation and identification issues are studied in detail. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimators is investigated using simulated data. The results show that the method produces reliable estimates of the parameters over several parameterisations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prior to 1978, medical institutions in China were either state-owned or were collective public hospitals. Since 1978, China has been trying to rebuild its healthcare system, which was destroyed during the cultural revolution', allowing private medical institutions to deliver healthcare services. As a result, private medical institutions have grown from 0% to 28.57% between 1978 and 2010. In this context, we compare outpatient healthcare expenditures between public and private medical institutions. The central problem of this comparison is that the choice of medical institution is endogenous. So we apply an instrumental variable (IV) framework utilizing geographic information (whether the closest medical institution is private) as the instrument while controlling for severity of health and other relevant confounding factors. Using China's Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Survey 2008-2010, we found that there is no difference in expenditure between public and private medical institutions when IV framework is used. Our econometric tests suggest that our IV model is specified appropriately. However, the ordinary least square model, which is inconsistent in the presence of endogenous regressor(s), reveals that public medical institutions are more expensive.

While there is evidence on insurance effects, we know very little about use of general or specific forms of medical care. We study the implications of the expansion on inpatient hospitalizations. Given the prevalence of mental health needs for young adults, we also specifically study mental health related inpatient care. We find evidence that compared to those aged 27-29 years, treated young adults aged 19-25 years increased their inpatient visits by 3.5 percent while mental illness visits increased 9.0 percent.

The relative humidity (RH) course and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensity were controlled via protocols. Additionally, drought stressed (dry) and well-watered (wet) treatments were established within each growth chamber. The plants were removed from the growth chambers after 14 days and they were left until a full maturity, exposed to actual weather conditions. The TGW at 14% moisture were evaluated for particular treatments within both winter wheat varieties. TGW was generally more affected by high temperatures under drought stress than in well-watered conditions. The results revealed that Pannonia TGW was much more affected by the water deficiency in combination with high temperature (particularly 38 and 41 degrees C) than Tobak TGW.","[Hlavacova, Marcela; Pohankova, Eva; Klem, Karel; Trnka, Miroslav] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Ctr, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Hlavacova, Marcela; Pohankova, Eva; Klem, Karel; Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno,"Hlavacova, M (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Ctr, Vvi, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",Marci.Hlava.22@gmail.com,"Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Hlaváčová, Marcela/O-3220-2018; Pohanková, Eva/H-7238-2014; Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014","Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; Hlaváčová, Marcela/0000-0003-3585-8499; Pohankova, Eva/0000-0001-7044-4078; Klem, Karel/0000-0002-6105-0429",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,43,47,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100006,0

Specifically, we invest potential impact of transaction attributes and governance structure on information exchange based on the perspectiVe of Transaction Cost Economics. A sample of 158 companies was analyzed by partial least square path modeling. In terms of relative contribution, we found that: (1) A higher level of environmental uncertainty is likely to induce a higher level of transaction specific investments. Meanwhile, it is also likely to induce trust and contractual governance, not directly but indirectly through induced transaction specific investments. However, market uncertainty does not necessarily induce communication willingness and behaviour. (2) Transaction specific investments appear to contribute into inducing trust and contractual governance, but does not necessarily help to improve communication willingness and behaviour. (3) Trust appears to be a reliable and positive indicator for contractual governance and communication willingness, but may not for communication behaviour. (4) Contractual governance does not necessarily help to improve a company's communication willingness and behaviour with its main suppliers. Managerial applications are generalized based on these findings.","[Peng Guang-qian; Zhao Yan] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Trienekens, Jacques H.; Omta, S.

Methods: Baseline VFQ-25 data from 240 participants with diabetic macular edema from a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial were used to evaluate the VFQ at the total score level. CTT, RMT, and IRT evaluations were conducted, and results were assessed in a head-to-head comparison. Results: Results were similar across the three methods, with IRT and RMT providing more detailed diagnostic information on how to improve the scale CTT led to the identification of two problematic items that threaten the validity of the overall scale score, sets of redundant items, and skewed response categories. IRT and RMT additionally identified poor fit for one item, many locally dependent items, poor targeting, and disordering of over half the response categories. Conclusions: Selection of a psychometric approach depends on many factors. Researchers should justify their evaluation method and consider the intended audience. If the instrument is being developed for descriptive purposes and on a restricted budget, a cursory examination of the CTT-based psychometric properties may be all that is possible. In a high stakes situation, such as the development of a patient reported outcome instrument for consideration in pharmaceutical labeling, however, a thorough psychometric evaluation including IRT or RMT should be considered, with final item-level decisions made on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative results.

Using asset sales as a quasi-natural experiment to detect the change in firms' real asset liquidity, we show that asset sales are significantly positively related to R&D investments.

In order to measure the health efficiency level and detect key factors that have the impact on the national health, the stochastic frontier production function is employed to measure the health production efficiency of each province in China. And the panel data regression model is used to test the. significance of factors or determinants that may improve or lower the health production efficiency. The relevant data are collected from China National Bureau of Statistics Yearbook from 2010 to 2013. The results show that the provinces close to the production frontier change little across the four years, whereas the provinces away from the frontier are becoming few. That more and more regions are productively efficient explains the average life expectancy growth in China. The factors that have significant impact on the health efficiency are those related to climate, health care fee, per capita income and the air quality. It is found that the air quality contributes most to the improvement of health production efficiency, and then the health care investments. Hence, the urgent task for a higher level of health productivity in China is to strengthen ecological protection and environmental governance while keeping steady economic growth and more health care investments.","[Zhai Yu-ying; Ge Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhai, YY (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,381,386,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600052,0

Building on this observation, I propose a novel moment selection procedure for GMM the Focused Moment Selection Criterion (FMSC) in which moment conditions are chosen not based on their validity but on the MSE of their associated estimator of a user-specified target parameter. The FMSC mimics, the situation faced by an applied researcher who begins with a set of relatively mild baseline assumptions and must decide whether to impose any of a collection of stronger but more controversial suspect assumptions. When the (correctly specified) baseline moment conditions identify the model, the FMSC provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator of asymptotic MSE, allowing us to select over the suspect moment conditions. I go on to show how the framework used to derive the FMSC can address the problem of inference post-moment selection. Treating post-selection estimators as a special case of moment-averaging, in which estimators based on different moment sets are given data-dependent weights, I propose simulation-based procedures for inference that can be applied to a variety of formal and informal moment-selection and averaging procedures. Both the FMSC and confidence interval procedures perform well in simulations. I conclude with an empirical example examining the effect of instrument selection on the estimated relationship between malaria and income per capita. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the effects of supplemental health insurance provided by a private insurer when added to compulsory public insurance that is already supplemented by private insurance. Using original panel data from a French mutuelle, we study the influence of insurance on all of the dimensions of healthcare expenditures: (1) the probability of using health care, (2) the number of uses conditional on use, and (3) the per unit cost of care. To conduct this study, we control, to the extent possible, for endogeneity because of adverse selection using the characteristics of our panel data. Our study allows us to confirm a positive and significant effect of the extra complementary health insurance on healthcare consumption, primarily in terms of the probability of using care. More interestingly, our results show that these effects are principally transitory mainly for the probability of using dental care and optical care and depend on income. Finally, we show that individuals did not postpone health care before enrollment.

Methods: The Partial Credit Model was applied to the three-level version of the EQ-5D with data obtained from four randomized controlled trials in prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer completed at baseline before treatment (N = 2213). DIF was assessed across cancer type (two levels), sex (two levels), and age group (three levels) using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistics and evaluated against the Educational Testing Service classification rules. Results: The presence of DIF was determined in 14 of 25 (56%) potential DIF contrasts in all the EQ-5D domains. Although mostly the DIF was categorized as either negligible (3 of 25 [12%]) or medium (7 of 25 [28%]), large DIF was observed in 4 of the 25 contrasts (16%). The mobility domain, in particular, showed consistently large DIF across cancer type, sex, and age. Conclusions: Given the use of the instrument in health status assessments across conditions and interventions, these results may have significant implications for the EQ-5D in health economic evaluations. Further research is warranted to determine whether these results hold for other cancers.","[Smith, Adam B.; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,York Sci Pk,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Cocks, Kim] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Parry, David] AstraZeneca Pharmaceut Ltd, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; AstraZeneca,"Smith, AB (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,York Sci Pk,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",adam.smith@york.ac.uk,"Cocks, Kim/AGG-7843-2022; Smith, Adam/AAI-9966-2020; Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","Cocks, Kim/0000-0003-2595-708X; Smith, Adam/0000-0002-5750-7772",UK Technology Strategy Board [KTP007957]; AstraZeneca Ltd [KTP007957],UK Technology Strategy Board; AstraZeneca Ltd(AstraZeneca),Adam B.

Data suggest great inequality in income per capita across countries, and a slight but noticeable increase in inequality across nations between 1960 and 2000. Seeking to explore the mechanism underlying the temporal evolution of the cross sectional distribution of economies, we develop a spatial growth model where saving rates are exogenous. Capital movements across locations are governed by a mechanism under which capital moves toward locations of relatively higher marginal productivity, with a velocity determined by the existing stock of capital. This augments the capital accumulation equation by a nonlinear diffusion term. Our results suggest that under diminishing returns, the growth process leads to a stable spatially nonhomogeneous distribution for per capita capital and income in the long run. Insufficient savings may lead to the emergence of persistent poverty cores where capital stock is depleted in some locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use a panel dataset from 2003 to 2006 constructed by the Research Center on the Rural Economy at the Ministry of Agriculture in China to investigate the effects of short-term and medium-term migration on health status. By combining propensity-score matching and the difference-in-difference model, we attempt to overcome the migration endogeneity issue and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated. We find that the effect of short-term migration on health in China is significantly positive mostly because of the income effect. However, the effect of longer-term continuous migration on health is insignificant and close to zero. Our results are robust to several alternative estimation techniques and a series of robustness checks.

Although Samuelson (1958) emphasized the role of fiat money as a certain kind of social contract, we cannot characterize it as a cooperative game-theoretic solution like the core.

Interest in this approach has resulted in several attempts to develop questionnaires to measure and value capability at an individual level in health economics. This commentary critically reviews the ability of these questionnaires to measure and value capability. It is argued that the method used in the questionnaires to measure capability will result in a capability set that is an inaccurate description of the individual's true capability set. The measured capability set will either represent only one combination and ignore the value of choice in the capability set, or represent one combination that is not actually achievable by the individual. In addition, existing methods of valuing capability may be inadequate because they do not consider that capability is a set. It may be practically more feasible to measure and value capability approximately rather than directly. Suggestions are made on how to measure and value an approximation to capability, but further research is required to implement the suggestions.","[Karimi, Milad; Brazier, John; Basarir, Hasan] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Karimi, M (通讯作者)，ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",milad.karimi@gmail.com,"Basarir, Hasan/K-8532-2019; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Basarir, Hasan/0000-0002-3202-4563; Karimi, Milad/0000-0002-5298-174X; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,24,25,26,2,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,795,799,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.006,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712707.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500016,0

This paper argues that two factors may contribute to the extent of cream-skimming: (i) degree of horizontal differentiation between public and private options when preferences are heterogeneous; (H) whether contract design encourages choice of private insurance before information about risk is revealed. I explore the role of these factors empirically within the unique institutional setting of the German health insurance system. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to disentangle adverse selection and moral hazard, I find no compelling support for extensive cream-skimming of public option by private insurers despite their ability to fully underwrite risk. A model of demand for private insurance supports the idea that heterogeneity in non pecuniary preferences and long-term structure of private insurance contracts may be muting cream skimming in this setting.

These regression models may not appropriately account for unobserved differences across hospitals (such as differences in organizational effectiveness) which could be mistaken for a volume outcome relation. Objective To explore alternative estimation methods for measuring the volume-outcome relation for six major cancer operations, and to determine which estimation method is most appropriate. Methods We analyzed patient-level hospital discharge data from three USA states and data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals from 2000 to 2011. We studied six major cancer operations using three regression frameworks (logistic, fixed-effects, and random-effects) to determine the correlation between patient outcome (mortality) and hospital volume. Results For our data, logistic and random-effects models suggest a non-zero volume effect, whereas fixed-effects models do not. Model-specification tests support the fixed-effects or random-effects model, depending on the surgical procedure; the basic logistic model is always rejected. Esophagectomy and rectal resection do not exhibit significant volume effects, whereas colectomy, pancreatic resection, pneumonectomy, and pulmonary lobectomy do. Conclusions The statistical significance of the hospital volume-outcome relation depends critically on the regression model. A simple logistic model cannot control for unobserved differences across hospitals that may be mistaken for a volume effect. Even when one applies panel-data methods, one must carefully choose between fixed- and random-effects models.","[Kim, Woohyeon; Ho, Vivian] Rice Univ, Dept Econ MS 22, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wolff, Stephen] Rice Univ, Dept Math MS 136, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Ho, Vivian] Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, 6100 Main St MS 40, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Ho, Vivian] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Rice University; Rice University; Rice University; Baylor College of Medicine,"Ho, V (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ MS 22, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.;Ho, V (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, 6100 Main St MS 40, Houston, TX 77005 USA.;Ho, V (通讯作者)，Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",vho@rice.edu,"Ho, Vivian/A-2827-2008","Ho, Vivian/0000-0002-5979-8155",Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [RP101207],Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas(Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas),Support for this study was provided from a grant by Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (RP101207).,,37,19,21,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance is not to take such costs into account in technology appraisals. However, standard appraisal practice involves modelling the benefits of those unrelated technologies. We argue that there is a sound principled reason for including both the costs and benefits of unrelated care. Changing this practice would have material consequences for decisions about reimbursing particular technologies, and we urge future research to understand this better.

The DCE scores must be anchored to the quality-of-life scale from 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Nevertheless, the characteristics of the statistical methods used for converting the EQ-5D-5L DCE results by using TTO information are not yet clearly known. Objectives: To present the Japanese DCE value set of the EQ-5D-5L and compare three methods for converting latent DCE values. Methods: The survey sampled the general population at five locations in Japan. 1098 respondents were stratified by age and sex. To obtain and compare the value sets of the EQ-5D-5L, the cTTO and DCE data were analyzed by a linear mixed model and conditional logit, respectively. The DCE scores were converted to the quality-of-life scale by anchoring to the worst state using cTTO, mapping DCE onto cTTO, and a hybrid model. Results: The data from 1026 respondents were analyzed. All the coefficients in the cTTO and DCE value sets were consistent throughout all the analyses. Compared with the cTTO algorithm, the mapping and hybrid methods yielded very similar scoring coefficients. The hybrid model results, however, produced a lower root mean square error and fewer health states with errors exceeding 0.05 than did the other models. The DCE anchored to the worst state overestimated the cTTO scores of almost all the health states. Conclusions: Japanese value sets based on DCE were demonstrated. On comparing the observed cTTO scores, we found that the hybrid model was slightly superior to the simpler methods, including the TTO model.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Sch Pharm, Otawara, Japan; [Noto, Shinichi] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth Sci, Niigata, Japan; [Igarashi, Ataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut, Tokyo, Japan; [Saito, Shinya] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Hlth Sci, Okayama, Japan; [Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Biomed Sci, Kusatsu, Japan",National Institute of Public Health - Japan; International University of Health & Welfare; Niigata University; University of Tokyo; Okayama University; Ritsumeikan University,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916; Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932; Noto, Shinichi/0000-0002-6952-7770","Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [H26-seisaku-shitei-012]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K08894] Funding Source: KAKEN","Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was funded by Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (H26-seisaku-shitei-012).",,27,157,160,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,648,654,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1834,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565282.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600019,0

This model allows for correlated variables specific to observations as well as macro variables which all observations share. This setup better fits many economic and financial applications where events are not independent. Nonparametric estimation of the hazard function is then studied. Kernel estimators proposed in Nielsen and Linton (1995) and Linton et al. (2003) are shown to have similar asymptotic properties compared with the i.i.d. case. Mixing conditions ensure the asymptotic results follow. These results depend on adjustments to bandwidth conditions. Simulations are conducted which verify the impact of dependence on estimators. Bandwidth selection accounting for dependence is shown to improve performance. In an empirical application, trade intensity in high-frequency financial data is estimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of systemic risk is the focus of recent econometric analyses and uses tail event and network based techniques. Here, in this paper we bring tail event and network dynamics together into one context. In order to pursue such joint efforts, we propose a semiparametric measure to estimate systemic interconnectedness across financial institutions based on tail-driven spillover effects in a high dimensional framework. The systemically important institutions are identified conditional to their interconnectedness structure. Methodologically, a variable selection technique in a time series setting is applied in the context of a single-index model for a generalized quantile regression framework. We could thus include more financial institutions into the analysis to measure their tail event interdependencies and, at the same time, be sensitive to non-linear relationships between them. Network analysis, its behaviour and dynamics, allows us to characterize the role of each financial industry group in 2007-2012: the depositories received and transmitted more risk among other groups, the insurers were less affected by the financial crisis. The proposed TENET-Tail Event driven NETwork technique allows us to rank the Systemic Risk Receivers and Systemic Risk Emitters in the US financial market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This was not included in the protocol for the five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) valuation study. Objectives: To test whether reintroducing a ranking task before the composite TTO (C-TTO) could help to reduce inconsistencies in C-TTO responses and improve the data quality. Methods: Respondents were randomly assigned to three study arms. The control arm was the present EQ-5D-5L study protocol, without ranking. The second arm (ranking without sorting) preceded the present protocol by asking respondents to rank the target health states using physical cards. The states were then valued in random order using C-TTO. In the third arm (ranking and sorting), the ranked states remained visible through the C-TTO tasks and the order of valuation was determined by the ranking. The study used only 10 EQ-5D-5L health states. We compared the C-TTO-based inconsistent pairs of health states and ties. Results: The final sample size was 196 in the control arm, 205 in the ranking without sorting arm, and 199 in the ranking and sorting arm. The percentages of ties by respondents were 15.1%, 12.5%, and 12.6% for the control arm, the ranking without sorting arm, and the ranking and sorting arm, respectively. The extra cost for adding the ranking task was about 15%. Conclusions: The benefit does not justify the effort involved in the ranking task. For this reason, the addition of the ranking task to the present EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol is not an attractive option.","[Ramos-Goni, Juan M.] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ramos-Goni, Juan M.] Res Network Hlth Serv Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Rand-Hendriksen, Kim] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Rand-Hendriksen, Kim] Akershus Univ Hosp, Hlth Serv Res Ctr, Lorenskog, Norway; [Pinto-Prades, Jose Luis] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Pinto-Prades, Jose Luis] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Navarra; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Ramos-Goñi, JM (通讯作者)，EuroQol Res Fdn, Execut Off, C Calvario 271-B 1IZQ, Tacoronte 38350, Santa Cruz De T, Spain.",juamanuel.ramosgoni@gmail.com,"prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008; prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022","prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099",EuroQol Group [2013320],EuroQol Group,This study was funded by a research grant (reference number 2013320) awarded by the EuroQol Group.,,13,7,7,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2016,19.0,4.0,,,,,478,486,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.002,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DO9GU,27325340.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378094200022,0

The typical strategy in Bayesian factor analysis to solve the rotation problem is to introduce ex-ante constraints on certain model parameters via degenerate and truncated prior distributions. This strategy, however, results in posterior distributions whose shapes depend on the ordering of the variables in the data set. We propose an alternative approach where the rotation problem is solved ex-post using Procrustean postprocessing. The resulting order invariance of the posterior estimator is illustrated in a simulation study and an empirical application using an established data set containing 120 macroeconomic time series. Favorable properties of the ex-post approach with respect to convergence, statistical and numerical accuracy are revealed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Lorenz order, we focus on the effect of changing the degree of inequality in both the distribution abilities and rewards on the distribution of effort. When the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of rewards is concave then reducing inequality of abilities increases effort at every rank, including aggregate effort. In general, aggregate effort increases (decreases) if the CDF of rewards has an increasing failure rate (decreasing failure rate). Further, unless the CDF of abilities is highly concave, increasing inequality of rewards always increases aggregate effort. Nonlinearity in the cost function also matters. The effect of changing the degree of inequality in either distribution of abilities or rewards, on aggregate effort, depends on the convexity of the cost function. In sum, our results challenge the current knowledge about the role of inequality in tournaments by showing how the distribution of effort including aggregate effort crucially depends on the convexity of the cost function and of the CDF of both rewards and abilities.

Glaucomatous vision loss is preventable with proper eye care, including appointment adherence. Therefore, interventions that improve appointment adherence can reduce the number of patients with more severe glaucoma. Objectives The primary study aim was to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted personal reminder intervention, which included a customized letter and personal telephone outreach, in improving appointment adherence of patients with glaucoma. A secondary study aim was to identify patient characteristics that were associated with non-adherence. Methods This prospective, randomized, controlled study included a cost-effectiveness analysis completed using a decision analytic model. The subjects included 256 patients with glaucoma. Study measures included appointment adherence and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Results Patients in the intervention group were more likely to adhere to appointments (82.31 vs. 69.05 %; RR 1.23; 95 % CI 1.04-1.37, p< 0.012) than patients in the usual care group. Patients in the intervention group were 23 % more likely to adhere to appointments (RR 1.23; 95 % CI 1.08-1.41, p< 0.0021) than patients in the usual care group, when adjusting for age, secondary insurance, primary open angle glaucoma diagnosis, number of previous visits at Wills Eye Hospital, and follow-up recommendation using Poisson regression. Per-patient cost of the program was US$11.32, and cost per follow-up attended within the adherence window was US$73.56. Conclusions A low cost reminder intervention consisting of a personalized letter and telephone outreach significantly improved appointment adherence of patients with glaucoma.","[Pizzi, Laura T.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Room 911, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Tran, Judie; Shafa, Anousheh; Waisbourd, Michael; Hark, Lisa; Murchison, Ann P.; Dai, Yang; Mayro, Eileen L.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Wills Eye Hosp, Glaucoma Res Ctr, 840 Walnut St,Suite 1140, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Haller, Julia A.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Wills Eye Hosp, 840 Walnut St,Suite 1500, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA",Jefferson University; Jefferson University; Jefferson University,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Room 911, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",laura.pizzi@jefferson.edu,,,Pennsylvania Department of Healt's Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) Program [4100051727],Pennsylvania Department of Healt's Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) Program,This study was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Healt's Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) Program (SAP#4100051727).,,32,8,8,0,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We use data from 2002 to 2010 to compare changes in receipt of mammograms and Pap tests in Massachusetts relative to other New England states. We also consider the effect specifically among low-income women. We find positive effects of Massachusetts health reform on cancer screening, suggesting a 4 to 5% increase in mammograms and 6 to 7% increase in Pap tests annually. Increases in both breast and cervical cancer screening are larger 3years after the implementation of reform than in the year immediately following, suggesting that there may be an adjustment or learning period. Low-income women experience greater increases in breast and cervical cancer screening than the overall population; among women with household income less than 250% of the federal poverty level, mammograms increase by approximately 8% and Pap tests by 9%. Overall, Massachusetts health reform appears to have increased breast and cervical cancer screening, particularly among low-income women. Our results suggest that reform was successful in promoting preventive care among targeted populations.

It avoids estimating the conditional density function of the dependent variable given the covariate and is asymptotically valid for any conditional quantile, any conditional quantile estimator, and any data structure, provided that certain weak convergence of the conditional quantile process holds for the original quantile estimator. We also construct a generic confidence band for the conditional quantile function across a range of covariate values. By using Yang-Stute estimator and two semiparametric quantile functions, we demonstrate the flexibility and simplicity of the direct approach.

Methods: Prostate cancer-specific health states were developed with attributes that varied across five health domains: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, pain, and fear of the future. Men with prostate cancer, men at risk for prostate cancer, and a sample of the general population assigned value to 18 disease specific health states using standard gamble (SG) methodology. Study participants also completed the Health Utilities Index (HUI) to obtain generic, community-based preference values to capture their current health rating. Results: A total of 136 participants were enrolled (n = 43 prostate cancer; n = 40 at risk for prostate cancer; n = 49 general population). Mean HUI mark 3 current health ratings: men with prostate cancer 0.75 +/- 0.260; men at risk for prostate cancer 0.77 +/- 0.238; general population 0.84 +/- 0.178. Mean SG preference values ranged from 0.46 to 0.85 among men with prostate cancer, 0.37 to 0.75 among men at risk for prostate cancer, and 0.32 to 0.81 among the general population group. Conclusions: In general, preference values for disease-specific health states using the patient perspective were higher than those for the general population. Generic preference values calculated from the HUI were higher than disease-specific preference values calculated from the SG. The higher values calculated from the HUI, from all three perspectives, indicate that a generic measure may not be sensitive enough to capture the disutility of prostate cancer symptoms, specifically sexual dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction, which are being directly measured in the disease specific health states.","[Gries, Katharine S.] Evidera, Seattle, WA USA; [Regier, Dean A.] BC Canc Agcy Res Ctr, Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Regier, Dean A.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Evidera; University of British Columbia; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gries, KS (通讯作者)，1417 4th Ave,Suite 510, Seattle, WA 98121 USA.",Katharine.gries@evidera.com,"Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492",Biobehavioral Cancer Prevention and Control Training Program from the National Cancer Institute [R25CA092408],Biobehavioral Cancer Prevention and Control Training Program from the National Cancer Institute,for this research was provided by the Biobehavioral Cancer Prevention and Control Training Program from the National Cancer Institute (grant no.

The identification strategy exploits the panel structure of the friendship data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to estimate individual fixed effects in the likelihood of friendship formation and then uses the fixed effect estimates as a control function in a model relating health outcomes to number of friends. Empirical results show that having a larger number of friends improves physical and mental health and also lowers the frequency of smoking cigarettes. Specifically, making one more friend increases an individual's general health measure by 6: 6% of a standard deviation. This suggests that accumulating social capital through friendship interactions is beneficial to health.

The conditions aim to accommodate various settings plausible in economic applications, and can apply also to panel, spatial and time series data. A mean square rate of convergence of nonparametric regression estimates is established followed by asymptotic normality of a quite general statistic. Data-driven studentizations that rely on single or double indices to order the data are justified.

Based on the preliminary estimates of the slope parameters and factors a la Bai (2009) and Moon and Weidner (2015), we propose a method for simultaneous selection of regressors and factors and estimation through the method of adaptive group Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). We show that with probability approaching one, our method can correctly select all relevant regressors and factors and shrink the coefficients of irrelevant regressors and redundant factors to zero. Further, we demonstrate that our shrinkage estimators of the nonzero slope parameters exhibit some oracle property. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the superb finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We apply our method to study the determinants of economic growth and find that in addition to three common unobserved factors selected by our method, government consumption share has negative effects, whereas investment share and lagged economic growth have positive effects on economic growth.

To predict the outcome of the loan game, we make two important assumptions: (i) players trade and split the surplus according to the Myerson value in any given loan network, and (ii) certain networks - networks that are pairwise stable and/or efficient under the Myerson value - are more likely to be formed. Two basic network structures, direct networks and star networks, are common in reality and sometimes coexist in a loan market. We explain these phenomena by showing that, if the link cost of each trade is small enough, these two networks are both efficient and internally stable, but they are not necessarily externally stable.

The use of pre-fermentative treatments show lower values of Folin-Ciocalteu index and total polyphenol index, excepting sample treated with tannin. Major color differences are found in the sample treated with tannin and oenological coal.

Since antibodies are produced in animals and current legislative developments demand the reduction of the use of animals for scientific purposes, the biosensor technology could be interesting for the quantification of allergens. By the combination of a technical device, the surface plasmon resonance, and a specific antibody it was possible to develop an antibody-based analytical method which is capable to detect lysozyme in quantities below 0.25 ppm. Since the biosensor is reusable multiple times, this approach can contribute to reduce the antibody consumption and therefore the use of animals for analysis.

Public reporting, although intended to increase consumer access to high-quality products, may have provided the perverse incentive for high-quality providers facing fixed capacity and administrative pricing to avoid less profitable types of residents. Using data from the nursing home industry before and after the implementation of the public reporting system in 2002, we find that high-quality nursing homes facing capacity constraints reduced admissions of less profitable Medicaid residents while increasing the more profitable Medicare and private-pay admissions, relative to low-quality nursing homes facing no capacity constraints. These effects, although small in magnitude, are consistent with provider rationing of demand on the basis of profitability and underscore the important role of institutional details in designing effective public reporting systems for regulated industries.

We first show that the leading test proposed by Breitung and Eickmeier (2011) exhibits nonmonotonic power, essentially because the breaks are considered as spurious factors with stable factor loadings. The proposed test eliminates the effects of the spurious factors by maximizing the test statistic over possible numbers of the original factors. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical example using U.S. Treasury yield curve data clearly illustrate the usefulness of the proposed test. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We modify the method of Hsiao, Ching and Wan (2012) by using the leave-n(v)-out cross-validation criterion for the optimal choice of the control cities. Some Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the better performance of our method. We then construct the counterfactual growth rates of housing prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing using the selected control cities. We find that: (i) purchase restrictions reduced the annual growth rate of housing prices in Beijing by 7.69 percent; (ii) the trial property tax of Chongqing reduced the annual growth rate of housing prices by 2.52 percent; (iii) the trial property tax of Shanghai had no significant effect on housing prices.

The results suggest that cost of surgery, waiting times for surgery, option to select a surgeon, convenience, and conditions of the hospital ward are important considerations for patients. The most important determinant of hospital choice was whether it was a public or private hospital, with respondents far more likely to choose a public hospital than a private hospital.

However, these statistical methods are known to be unreliable if the data are fractionally integrated. Moreover, spot and futures price data tend to display clear patterns of time-varying volatility which also has the potential to invalidate the use of these methods. Using new tests constructed within a more general heteroskedastic fractionally integrated model we are able to find a body of evidence in support of the efficient market hypothesis for a number of commodities. Our new tests are wild bootstrap implementations of score-based tests for the order of integration of a fractionally integrated time series. These tests are designed to be robust to both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity of a quite general and unknown form in the shocks. We show that the asymptotic tests do not admit pivotal asymptotic null distributions in the presence of heteroskedasticity, but that the corresponding tests based on the wild bootstrap principle do. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that very significant improvements in finite sample behaviour can be obtained by the bootstrap vis-a-vis the corresponding asymptotic tests in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments.

Despite this increasing use, there are few studies that investigate the validity of the DCE in health. This study investigates the external validity of DCE by comparing the predicted treatment choices from the DCE to the actual treatment choices made by the same respondents using a decision board (DB) approach. The sample includes 140 patients who came for a sleep apnea routine visit in a hospital setting. Each respondent answered 10 DCE tasks and 1 DB task. The preferences were estimated with a generalized multinomial logit model and the predicted and actual treatment choices were compared both at the sample and individual levels. The results raise questions about the external validity of DCE in health. At the sample level, the comparison showed large but not significant differences between the two methods. This can be explained in part by the aggregation process that obscures variability in the individuals' preferences. At the individual level, the comparison showed that the two methods led to significantly different patterns of choices.

Using Hospital Episode Statistics between 1st April 2010 and 31st March 2011 linked to all-cause mortality within 30days of admission, we estimate the number of excess deaths and the loss in quality-adjusted life years associated with emergency weekend admissions. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 3.70% for weekday admissions and 4.05% for weekend admissions. The excess weekend death rate equates to 4355 (risk adjusted 5353) additional deaths each year. The health gain of avoiding these deaths would be 29727-36539 quality-adjusted life years per year. The estimated cost of implementing 7-day services is 1.07- pound 1.43bn pound, which exceeds by 339- pound 831m pound the maximum spend based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of 595m- pound 731m pound. There is as yet no clear evidence that 7-day services will reduce weekend deaths or can be achieved without increasing weekday deaths. The planned cost of implementing 7-day services greatly exceeds the maximum amount that the National Health Service should spend on eradicating the weekend effect based on current evidence. Policy makers and service providers should focus on identifying specific service extensions for which cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.

The transition probability density function (TPDF) of a diffusion process plays an important role in understanding and explaining the dynamics of the process. A new way to find closed-form approximate TPDFs for multivariate diffusions is proposed in this paper. This method can be applied to general multivariate time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes, as long as, roughly speaking, they have smooth drift and volatility functions. A diffusion process is said to be reducible if it can be converted into a unit diffusion process where the volatility is the identity matrix. We have established how to obtain the approximate TPDF of a reducible diffusion explicitly. When a diffusion process is not reducible, an explicit form of approximate TPDF can be obtained by using the results in Ait-Sahalia (2008) and Choi (2013). The TPDF expansion suggested here enables us to obtain a recursive formula for the coefficient of the approximate TPDF for a multivariate jump diffusion. Monte Carlo simulation studies of conducting maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using our approximations provide convincing evidence that our TPDF expansion can be used for the MLE when the true TPDF is unavailable. We also applied our approximate TPDFs to option pricing. The differences between our option prices and those from the Extended Black-Scholes formula are shown to be quite small.

Methods: A health science research implementation team coordinated with ED stakeholders and staff to provide training, implementation guidelines, and support to launch ED registered nurse administered HIV oral rapid testing. Deidentified quantitative data were gathered from the electronic medical records detailing quarterly HIV rapid test rates in the Ell setting spanning the first 5 years. Comprehensive cost analyses were conducted to evaluate the financial impact of this implementation. Results: At 5 years, a total of 2,620 tests were conducted with a quarterly mean of 131 +/- 81. Despite quarterly variability in testing rates, regression analysis revealed an average increase of 3.58 tests per quarter. Over the course of this implementation, Veterans Health Administration policy transitioned from written to verbal consent for HIV testing, serving to reduce the time and cost(s) associated with the testing process. Conclusions: Our data indicated salient health outcome benefits for patients with respect to the potential for earlier detection, and associated long-run cost savings.

For applications with many candidate moments, our asymptotic analysis accommodates a diverging number of moments as the sample size increases. The proposed procedure achieves three objectives in one-step: (i) the valid and relevant moments are distinguished from the invalid or irrelevant ones; (ii) all desired moments are selected in one step instead of in a stepwise manner; (iii) the parameters of interest are automatically estimated with all selected moments as opposed to a post-selection estimation. The new method performs moment selection and efficient estimation simultaneously via an information-based adaptive GMM shrinkage estimation, where an appropriate penalty is attached to the standard GMM criterion to link moment selection to shrinkage estimation. The penalty is designed to signal both moment validity and relevance for consistent moment selection. We develop asymptotic results for the high-dimensional GMM shrinkage estimator, allowing for non-smooth sample moments and weakly dependent observations. For practical implementation, this one-step procedure is computationally attractive. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the accuracy of such a risk estimator is largely unknown. We study factor-based risk estimators under a large amount of assets, and introduce a high-confidence level upper bound (H-CLUB) to assess the estimation. The H-CLUB is constructed using the confidence interval of risk estimators with either known or unknown factors. We derive the limiting distribution of the estimated risks in high dimensionality. We find that when the dimension is large, the factor-based risk estimators have the same asymptotic variance no matter whether the factors are known or not, which is slightly smaller than that of the sample covariance-based estimator. Numerically, H-CLUB outperforms the traditional crude bounds, and provides an insightful risk assessment, In addition, our simulated results quantify the relative error in the risk estimation, which is usually negligible using 3-month daily data.

Two instances of large dimensional models are the linear regression with a large number of covariates and the estimation of a regression function with many instrumental variables. An appropriate setting to analyze high dimensional problems is provided by a functional linear model, in which the covariates belong to Hilbert spaces. This paper considers the case where covariates are endogenous and assumes the existence of instrumental variables (that are functional as well). The paper shows that estimating the regression function is a linear ill-posed inverse problem, with a known but data-dependent operator. The first contribution is to analyze the rate of convergence of the penalized least squares estimator. Based on the result, we discuss the notion of instrument strength in the high dimensional setting. We also discuss a generalized version of the estimator, when the problem is premultiplied by an instrument-dependent operator. This extends the technology of Generalized Method of Moments to high dimensional, functional data. A central limit theorem is also established on the inner product of the estimator. The studied estimators are easy and fast to implement, and the finite-sample performance is discussed through simulations and an application to the impact of age-specific fertility rate curves on yearly economic growth in the United Kingdom.

Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates suggest that migraines are associated with reduced labor force participation and lower wages among females. A negative association between migraine headache and the wages of female respondents is also obtained using an instrumental variables (IV) approach, although the IV estimates are imprecise relative to the OLS estimates.

We consider whether the reduction in fertility resulting from population control policies has had any effect on the health of elderly parents in China. In particular, we examine the influence of this fertility decline, experienced due to China's one-child policy, on several measures of the health of parents in middle and old age. Overall, our results suggest that having fewer children has a positive effect on self-reported parental health but generally no effect on other measures of health. The results also suggest that upstream financial transfers have a positive effect on several measures of parental health.

The multiple causes of nonadherence differ both within and between patients and are influenced by patients' care settings. Objectives: '1'he objective of this article was to identify determinants of patient nonadherence to antihypertensive medicines, drawing from psychosocial and economic models of behavior. Methods: Outpatients with hypertension from Austria, Belgium, England, Germany, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Poland, and Wales were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey. Nonadherence to medicines was assessed using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (primary outcome) and the Medication Adherence Rating Scale. Associations with adherence and nonadherence were tested for demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors. Results: A total of 2595 patients completed the questionnaire. The percentage of patients classed as nonadherent ranged from 24% in The Netherlands to 70% in Hungary. Low age, low selfefficacy, and respondents' perceptions of their illness and cost related barriers were associated with nonadherence measured on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale across several countries. In multilevel, multivariate analysis, low self-efficacy (odds ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.77) and a high number of perceived barriers to taking medicines (odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval 1.38-2.09) were the main significant determinants of nonadherence. Country differences explained 11% of the variance in nonadherence. Conclusions: Among the variables measured, patients' adherence to antihypertensive medicines is influenced primarily by their self-efficacy, illness beliefs, and perceived barriers. These should be targets for interventions for improving adherence, as should an appreciation of differences among the countries in which they are being delivered.","[Morrison, Valerie L.; Parveen, Sahdia] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Holmes, Emily A.

This phenomenon is known as overfitting and generally occurs when a model is excessively complex relative to the amount of data available. Overfitting is a major threat to regression analysis in terms of both inference and prediction. We start by showing that the Copas measure becomes confounded by shrinkage or expansion arising from in-sample bias when applied to the untransformed scale of nonlinear models, which is typically the scale of interest when assessing behaviors or analyzing policies. We then propose a new measure of overfitting that is both expressed on the scale of interest and immune to this problem. We also show how to measure the respective contributions of in-sample bias and overfitting to the overall predictive bias when applying an estimated model to new data. We finally illustrate the properties of our new measure through both a simulation study and a real-data illustration based on inpatient healthcare expenditure data, which shows that the distinctions can be important.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a research agenda to explore the potential of artistic gymnastics, a sport in which the Russian Federation has excelled for many years, as an agent of tourism development. The paper will take a case study approach, considering the nature of fandom and identifying features of artistic gymnastics as cultural heritage and sports tourism product. The national and international environment within which it is set are examined, prior to the development of a research agenda. A detailed review of literature on the historic, current and emerging trends in Russian artistic gymnastics; the place of artistic gymnastics in tourism development and sports tourism in Russia will be carried out. The paper's findings will include considerations of The nature of gymnastics fandom, both in Russia and internationally The nature of sports tourism development in the Russian Federation The nature of gymnastics as a sport and its competition cycle Artistic gymnastics as cultural heritage, and its potential as an autonomous means of promoting Russian national identity The relationship between Russia's sometimes fading gymnastics competition results, and its potential to leverage the sport for tourism interest The potential for tourism product development linked to artistic gymnastics in the Russian Federation.

As the most basic and important type of statistical arbitrage strategy, pairs trading ([9]) has been studied by many researchers ([9-20]). Signaling mechanism is an integral part of pairs trading. Focusing on studying signaling mechanism of pairs trading, this paper provides two representative signaling mechanisms and derives analytical formulae of the optimal signal points. The ultimate goal is to obtain the solution of optimal signaling mechanism for pairs trading. Under the help of co-integration ([20-23]) approach, we construct an asset portfolio whose price process follows mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process ([23-28]). Through using some known results to make some suitable simplifications and transformations, we derive two mathematical models of expected revenue optimization problems corresponding to the two signaling mechanisms. Then approximate analytical solutions of two problems are respectively worked out. A comparison between the two models of optimization problems is made to draw a significant conclusion about the best choice of signaling mechanism in pairs trading.","[Chen Yuan-qiao; Zhu Hong-jiang; Li Dong-xin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Chen, YQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171109],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71171109).,,38,0,0,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1256,1262,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600168,0

Individual samples were subjected to sensory evaluation including evaluation of colour. We have determined the extract content (actual and apparent), alcohol, and original gravity of the hopped wort. The highest alcohol content (5.25%) occurs in samples using light caramel wheat malt in both ratios of malt. The contents of both actual and apparent extract were increased to 6.5%, 4.8% resp., by using malt kilned at higher temperature (100 degrees C or 120 degrees C) and using a higher dose of wheat malt. Beers that show the lightest colour (over L* = 80) are those made with a greater proportion of barley malt and malt kilned at lower temperature (80 degrees C). When comparing both ratios used, the better scoring assessed beers were those using more barley malt, therefore the best evaluated beer was produced from Pilsner malt type with 30% wheat and 70% barley malt.","[Dostalova, Yvona; Hrivna, Ludek; Janeckova, Marie; Machalkova, Lenka; Pavlu, Milena; Juzl, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Food Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Mrkvicova, Eva] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Vyhnanek, Tomas; Trojan, Vaclav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Plant Biol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Dostalova, Y (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Food Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",yvona.dostalova@mendelu.cz,"Trojan, Václav/L-5826-2018; Mrkvicová, Eva/K-9713-2018; Jůzl, Miroslav/L-2033-2018; Vyhnanek, Tomas/D-5247-2012","Jůzl, Miroslav/0000-0001-7870-7282; Vyhnanek, Tomas/0000-0002-9628-3716; Mrkvicova, Eva/0000-0002-2504-5024",,,,,12,3,3,1,9,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,343,349,,,,,,7,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100063,0

Based on the results estimated by VAR model with 8 months lag, the author concluded that exchange rate solely affects the growth of industrial output and the growth of import. Besides that, exchange rate had limited impact to inflation. By analyzing the effect of shock response, the research figured out that exchange rate shock strongly affected to the growth of import in the second month, but weakly and slowly on the growth of export. Moreover, the impact on monetary supply exists in third month but it is so weakly. The variance decomposition analysis demonstrated that the changing of exchange rate impacted on macroeconomic factors in both long term and short term. The changing of inflation was explained by exchange rate most strongly in eighth month with 13.4% and by the growth of impact so slowly and weakly.","[Duy Suu Nguyen; Thi Phuong Thao Bui] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Nguyen, DS (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",nguyenduysuu@tdt.edu.vn; buithiphuongthao@tdt.edu.vn,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,174,189,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900011,0

We first consider both separable and nonseparable space-time filters for the stable model. The separable space-time filter is subject to a parametric restriction which results in relative computational simplicity. In contrast to the spatial econometrics literature, we expose economic restrictions imposed by the separable space-time filter model and explore computational tractability of the nonseparable filter model. Throughout this paper, the effect of initial observations is taken into account, which results in an exact likelihood function for estimation. This is important when the span of time periods is short. We then investigate spatial unstable cases, where we propose to apply a spatial differencing to all variables in the regression equation as a data transformation, which may eliminate unstable or explosive spatial components in order to achieve a robust estimator. For estimates of the parameters in both the regression part and the disturbance process, they are root nT-consistent and asymptotically centered normal regardless of whether T is large or not and whether the process is stable or not.

Traditional health technology assessment and modeling methods often neglect the wider health system impacts that can be critical for achieving desired health system goals and are often of limited usefulness when applied to complex health systems. Researchers and health care decision makers can either underestimate or fail to consider the interactions among the people, processes, technology, and facility designs. Health care delivery system interventions need to incorporate the dynamics and complexities of the health care system context in which the intervention is delivered. This report provides an overview of common dynamic simulation modeling methods and examples of health care system interventions in which such methods could be useful. Three dynamic simulation modeling methods are presented to evaluate system interventions for health care delivery: system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based modeling. In contrast to conventional evaluations, a dynamic systems approach incorporates the complexity of the system and anticipates the upstream and downstream consequences of changes in complex health care delivery systems. This report assists researchers and decision makers in deciding whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health system problems through an eightpoint checklist referred to as the SIMULATE (System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence) tool. it is a primer for researchers and decision makers working in health care delivery and implementation sciences who face complex challenges in delivering effective and efficient care that can be addressed with system interventions. On reviewing this report, the readers should be able to identify whether these simulation modeling methods are appropriate to answer the problem they are addressing and to recognize the differences of these methods from other modeling approaches used typically in health technology assessment applications.

The Mean First Time (MFPT) is an important indicator in depicting the information diffusion process and underlying topology behind the complex networks, attracting more and more scholars' attention. However, many scholars neglect the direct flow and dissipation for each vertex in the previous random walk model and the computation of the fundamental matrix approach for MFPT is quite expensive when the network size is large. In this paper, we deduce another explicit expression of MFPT according to the Markov Process, which is the same with the conventional representation but own high computational efficiency. Based on the new expression of MFPT, we provide a sub-matrix module algorithm to solve the low memory problem in the large-scale MFPT calculation. Experiments on the clickstream network show the algorithm's feasibility. This paper provides a framework to conduct MFPT analysis in large-scale generic complex networks and may be meaningful to many research fields like the spread of public opinions, epidemics diffusion, community detection and so on.

The aim of this study was to determine whether interactions of probiotics with porcine monocyte derived macrophages (MDMF) lead to structural changes of these cells during in vitro cultivation. We used the light microscopy and our findings suggest that probiotics affected the structural changes of porcine MDMF. Part of MDMF underwent apoptosis or necrosis and it was described the different stadia leading to the cell death. In some MDMF numerous vacuoles are accumulated in cytoplasm.

Our confidence set is easy to implement: it takes the form of a closed interval and its critical values have closed-form expressions. Simulation study reveals the better finite sample performance of our confidence set than the naive confidence set ignoring the discontinuity issue.

These utility functions allow for fairly general discounting of consumption over finite time horizons, but add a utility weight to the bulk of the consumption sequence, which we identify with the indefinite future. As our commodity space we use the space of all convergent sequences with the limit of the sequence representing consumption in the indefinite future. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the attainability of the Pareto optimal allocations. This condition implies that efficiency can only be attained if consumers' valuations of time are very similar. Our proof relies on the existence of an interior solution to certain infinite dimensional optimization problems. If the condition is not met, no interior quasi-equilibria exist. We extend the model to include consumers with Rawlsian-like maximin utility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A review of 20 recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence appraisals showed that 17 of them took the mean weight or BSA of patients, 2 costed the individual patient data from trials, and 2 fitted a distribution to patient-level data. Objectives: To investigate the estimated drug costs using different methodologies to account for patient characteristics for pharmaceuticals with a weight- or BSA-based posology. The secondary objective was to explore the suitability of general population data as a proxy for patient-level data. Methods: Patient-level data were pooled from three clinical trials and used to calculate a hypothetical cost per administration of eight licensed pharmaceuticals, applying the three methods used in recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence appraisals. The same analysis was performed using data from the Health Survey for England (in place of patient-level data) to investigate the validity of using general population data as a substitute for patient-level data. Results: Compared with using patient-level data from clinical trials, the mean patient characteristics (weight or BSA) led to an underestimation of drug cost by 6.1% (range +1.5% to 25.5%). Fitting a distribution to patient-level data led to a mean difference of +0.04%. All estimates were consistent using general population data. Conclusions: Estimation of drug costs in health economic evaluation should account for the distribution in weight or BSA to produce accurate results. When patient data are not available, general population data may be used as an alternative.","[Hatswell, Anthony J.; Porter, Joshua; Lee, Dawn] BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, London, England; [Hertel, Nadine] Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceut Ltd, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Latimer, Nicholas R.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; Bristol-Myers Squibb; University of Sheffield,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",ahatswell@bresmed.co.uk,"lee, dawn/GRJ-7459-2022","Porter, Joshua/0000-0002-1641-4625; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,7,4,4,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,1055,1058,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.013,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987632.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300019,0

Methods: A probabilistic Markov model was used to simulate costs and clinical outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of men and women with and without screening over the course of 25 years, using a societal perspective. Results: Screening was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 23,004/quality-adjusted life-year compared with routine care. Nevertheless, if the relative risk of stroke and systematic embolism in screen-detected patients is more than 12% lower than that in patients with atrial fibrillation identified through routine practice, then screening would not be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 45,000/quality-adjusted life-year. An analysis comparing alternative combinations of start age and screening interval found that less frequent screening with a later start age may be more cost-effective than an annual screening from age 65 years. Conclusions: Annual opportunistic screening of men and women aged 65 years and older in primary care in Ireland is likely to be cost-effective using conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds, assuming that those detected through screening have a comparable stroke risk profile as those detected through routine practice. Raising the start age of screening or increasing the screening interval may improve the cost-effectiveness of a prospective screening program.","[Moran, Patrick S.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Hlth Policy & Management, Foster Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Moran, Patrick S.; Teljeur, Conor; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Mairin] Hlth Informat & Qual Author, Hlth Technol Assessment, Dublin, Ireland; [Teljeur, Conor] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Dublin, Ireland; [Smith, Susan M.] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dept Gen Practice, Dublin, Ireland; [Smyth, Breda] Merlin Pk Univ Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Serv Execut, Galway, Ireland; [Harbison, Joseph] St James Hosp, Trinity Coll Dublin, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dublin, Ireland; [Normand, Charles] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland; [Ryan, Mairin] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Moran, PS (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Hlth Policy & Management, Foster Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland.",moranps@tcd.ie,"Smith, Susan M/D-1872-2012","Smith, Susan M/0000-0001-6027-2727; Ryan, Mairin/0000-0002-3145-0878; Normand, Charles/0000-0002-0885-5754; Moran, Patrick/0000-0003-4476-569X; Harbison, Joseph/0000-0003-3680-5751",,,,,83,20,20,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,985,995,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.07.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987649.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300011,0

Objectives: To use a pharmacometric MBMA within a pharmacoeconomic model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A Markov micro simulation model was developed to estimate monthly changes in the key disease severity metrics of COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEVi] and exacerbations) to compare a hypothetical drug that increases FEVi to usual care. The MBMA was used to predict a baseline exacerbation rate in a group of actual trial patients, given their known baseline FEVi. The hypothetical drug increased FEVi, thereby decreasing individuals' predicted exacerbation rates. Individual patient simulations allowed stochastic changes in monthly FEVi decline. Results: In a sample of 1097 trial patients with a mean FEVi of 50%, the MBMA predicted 0.93 exacerbations per year on average. The exacerbation rate ranged from 0.52 to 1.3 per year across moderate and severe patient subgroups. A hypothetical anti-inflammatory drug that increased FEVi by 50 ml decreased exacerbations by 26%. Given a simplified estimation of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with COPD, a drug with a 50-ml increase priced at 35/mo had an incremental costeffectiveness ratio ranging from 13,000/QALY to approximately 207,000/QALY across patient severity subgroups. Conclusions: The synergistic aspects of MBMA and pharmacoeconomic modeling are highlighted in this hypothetical example. Markov microsimulation modeling allows the finer predictions of MBMA to inform parameters. Such an approach has utility in both early-phase cost-effectiveness estimations and trial design.","[Slejko, Julia F.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor,Room 01-214, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Ribbing, Jakob] Pharmetheus AB, Uppsala, Sweden; [Milligan, Peter] Pfizer, Global Clin Pharmacol, Sandwich, Kent, England",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Pfizer,"Slejko, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor,Room 01-214, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",jslejko@rx.umaryland.edu,"Slejko, Julia/M-9335-2019",,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"Much of this work was conducted while J.F.

I analyse the mathematical representations of random processes of innovation that exhibit constant, increasing or decreasing returns to scale in that sense and determine their respective functional forms. I also give two complementary conditions, which are respectively sufficient for increasing returns to scale, and decreasing returns. Finally, as a particular case, I show processes that use only one factor of innovation and satisfy constant returns form a one-parameter family. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Participants (n = 48) were recruited from community support groups if they had a child aged 26 years or younger diagnosed with a coexisting mental health condition and cognitive impairment. Six in-depth interviews eliciting care management experiences were transcribed and coded into themes following the principles of grounded theory and the constant comparative method. Six focus groups involving 42 participants assessed the relevance, priority, and meaning and inter-relationship among the themes. The positive predictive value and sensitivity assessed agreement on thematic meaning. A final list was selected from the top priorities with good agreement as candidate attributes. Attribute levels reflecting the range of experiences in care management decisions emerged from the verbatim passages within each coded theme. Results: Participants were the child's mother (73%), white (77%), married (69%), and on average 48 years old. The children were on average 14 years old; 44% had an intellectual disability, 25% had autism, and more than half had anxiety or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All 14 attributes identified from the in-depth interviews were deemed relevant. The positive predictive value exceeded 90%, and the sensitivity ranged from 64% to 89%. The final set of attributes formed the framework for care management decisions consisting of six attributes (medication, behavior, services, social, treatment effects, and school) each with three levels. Conclusions: A systematic approach grounded in qualitative methods produced a framework of relevant, important, and actionable attributes representing competing alternatives in clinical decisions.","[dosReis, Susan; Castillo, Wendy Camelo; Ross, Melissa] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Fitz-Randolph, Marcy] PatientsLikeMe, Cambridge, MA USA; [Vaughn-Lee, Angela; Butler, Beverly] Univ Maryland PIONEER Study Community Partners, Baltimore, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"dosReis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",sdosreis@rx.umaryland.edu,,"Ross, Melissa/0000-0001-7317-9273",Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Award [ME-1306-01511],Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Award(Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute - PCORI),"This work was supported through a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Award (ME-1306-01511; principal investigator: S. dosReis).

We allow the censoring to depend on both observable and unobservable variables in arbitrary ways. Generally, these models are set identified and the main contribution of this paper is to derive and characterize the identified sets under general conditions. Our main characterization theorems show that every parameter in the sharp set and only those parameters can generate the observed data under the maintained assumptions. In particular, we consider two separate sets of assumptions (2 models): the first uses stationarity on the unobserved disturbance terms. The second is a nonstationary model with a conditional independence restriction. Based on the characterizations of the identified sets, we provide an inference procedure that is shown to yield valid confidence sets based on inverting stochastic dominance tests. We also show how our results extend to empirically interesting dynamic versions of the model with both lagged observed outcomes, lagged indicators, and models with factor loads. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions for point identification in terms of support conditions. The paper then examines the size of the identified sets in particular designs, and a Monte Carlo exercise shows reasonable small sample performance of our procedures. We also apply our inference approach to two empirical illustrations that link endogenous censoring to treatment effects models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These results imply that mechanisms governing decisions in the health domain are similar to those in the monetary domain. However, we also report one important deviation: utility is universally concave for the health outcomes used in this study, in contrast to the commonly found S-shaped utility for monetary outcomes, with concave utility for gains and convex utility for losses.

This paper examines the relationship between Medicare managed care penetration and treatment intensity for FFS enrollees hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of AMI. I find that increased Medicare managed care penetration is associated with a reduction in both the costs and the treatment intensity of FFS AMI patients. Specifically, as Medicare managed care penetration increases, FFS AMI patients are less likely to receive surgical reperfusion and mechanical ventilation and to experience an overall reduction in the number of inpatient procedures.

Methods: We reanalyzed aggregate data from a published network meta-analysis that compared four anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) as well as warfarin. Event rates for stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding were generated for each agent across seven subgroups, and rankings were developed on the basis of clinical performance. Utilities were derived from a national catalog and then applied to generate summary measures of benefit. The choice between any two agents was examined across a range of plausible utility values, defined as the interquartile range for stroke/SE and major bleeding. Results: Little HTE was apparent in clinical and utility-adjusted analyses. Dabigatran 150 mg produced the lowest rates of stroke/SE, and edoxaban 30 mg had the lowest rate of major bleeding. Greater HTE was observed when utilities were varied across a plausible utility range. For example, among patients 75 years and older, dabigatran 150 mg would be preferred over edoxaban 30 mg when mean utility estimates are used. The preferred agent, however, would change at plausible utility thresholds of 0.6 and 0.7 for major bleeding and stroke/SE, respectively. Nearly 25% of all possible comparisons would see a change in preferred treatment within the plausible utility range. Conclusions: The optimal choice of anticoagulant in atrial fibrillation differs across subgroups defined by clinical characteristics and reasonable ranges of utilities.","[Cameron, Christopher G.] Cornerstone Res Grp, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Synnott, Patricia G.; Pearson, Steven D.; Ollendorf, Daniel A.] Inst Clin & Econ Review, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA; [Dubois, Robert W.; Ciarametaro, Michael] Natl Pharmaceut Council, Washington, DC USA",Cornerstone Research Group,"Ollendorf, DA (通讯作者)，Inst Clin & Econ Review, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",dollendorf@icer-review.org,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,661,669,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1835,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565284.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600021,0

Objectives: To examine the impact of this policy on persistence with ChEIs. Methods: A population based cohort study was conducted using British Columbia administrative health data. We examined 45,537 new ChEI users aged 40 years and older between 2001 and 2012; 20,360 (45%) started the treatment after the coverage policy was launched. Patients were followed until treatment discontinuation, defined as a ChEI-free gap of 90 days, death, or December 2013. Persistence on ChEIs was estimated using survival analysis and competing risk approach. Hazards of discontinuation were compared using competing risk Cox regression with propensity adjustment. Results: Patients who started ChEI therapy after the introduction of the coverage policy had a significantly longer persistence. Median ChEI persistence until discontinuation or death was 9.37 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.0-39.7) and 17.6 months (95% CI 16.9-18.3) in patients who started therapy before and after the new policy, respectively. The propensity-adjusted hazard ratio for discontinuing therapy was 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94). Similar patterns were observed for persistence with the first ChEI (propensity-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.98).

Yet, it remains an underused strategy in the Netherlands. Methods: Budget-impact analyses of current and new market-share scenarios of PST and/or PSM compared with monitoring at specialized centers were performed for a national cohort of 260,338 patients requiring long-term anticoagulation testing. A health care payer perspective and 1- to 5-year time horizons were applied. The occurrence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications in the aforementioned patient population was assessed in a Markov model. Dutch-specific costs were applied, next to effectiveness data derived from a meta-analysis on PST and/or PSM. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess uncertainty on budget-impact analysis results. Results: Increasing PST and/or PSM usage in the national cohort from the current 15.4% to 50% resulted in savings ranging from 8 million after the first year to 184 million after 5 years. Further increases in the use of PST and/or PSM produced greater savings. Sensitivity analyses revealed budget-impact model sensitivity to the baseline and relative risks of thromboembolic complications. Unfavorable budget impact was found in scenarios exploring an increase in the use of PST alone as well as an increase in the market share of PST and PSM in patients with atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: Overall study findings indicated that PST and PSM are more favorable alternatives to monitoring at specialized centers in patients without atrial fibrillation.","[Stevanovic, Jelena; Postma, Maarten J.; Le, Hoa H.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Stevanovic, J (通讯作者)，Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",j.stevanovic@rug.nl,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",Roche Diagnostics,Roche Diagnostics,This study was supported by a grant from Roche Diagnostics.,,37,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2016,19.0,4.0,,,,,383,390,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.12.017,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DO9GU,27325330.0,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378094200012,0

Self-management education programs have been shown to be beneficial for patients with different chronic conditions and to have a higher impact on health outcomes than does didactic education. Objective: To investigate improvements in glycemic control (measured by glycated hemoglobin A1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Our comparative trial involved one group of patients receiving patient-centered education and another receiving didactic education. We dealt with selection bias issues, estimated the different impact of both programs, and validated our analysis using quantile regression techniques. Results: We found evidence of better mean glycemic control in patients receiving the patient centered program, which engaged better patients. Nevertheless, that differential impact is nonmonotonic. Patients initially at the healthy range at the patient-centered program maintained their condition better. Patients close to, but not within, the healthy range benefited equally from attending either program. Patients with very high glycemic level benefited significantly more from attending the patient-centered program. Finally, patients with the worst initial glycemic control (far from the healthy range) improved equally their diabetic condition, regardless of which program they attended. Conclusions: Different patients are sensitive to different categories of education programs. The optimal, cost-effective design of preventative programs for patients with chronic conditions needs to account for the different impact in different patient categories. This implies stratifying patients and providing the appropriate preventative education program, or looking for alternative policy implementations for unresponsive patients who have the most severe condition and are the most costly.","[Windrum, Paul] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Garcia-Goni, Manuel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 2, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Coad, Holly] OT Practice, Hook, Hants, England",University of Nottingham; Complutense University of Madrid,"García-Goñi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 2, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",mggoni@ucm.es,"García-Goñi, Manuel/AAJ-5062-2020; Silva-Castillo, Vicente-Xavier xs/S-5324-2018","García-Goñi, Manuel/0000-0001-5266-7112;",European Commission [FP7-SSH-2007-1]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion in Spain; Ramon Areces Foundation,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion in Spain(Spanish Government); Ramon Areces Foundation,"This research was conducted through the project The Contribution of Public and Private Services to European Growth and Welfare, and the Role of Public Private Innovation Networks (ServPPIN), financed by the European Commission, VII Framework Programme (FP7-SSH-2007-1), and through the project La innovacion en servicios y las interacciones entre servicios pUblicos y privados: el caso de la sanidad, financed by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion in Spain.

However, PROMs are prone to missing data. For example, hospitals often fail to administer the pre-operative questionnaire at hospital admission, or patients may refuse to participate or fail to return their post-operative questionnaire. A key concern with missing PROMs is that the individuals with complete information tend to be an unrepresentative sample of patients within each provider and inferences based on the complete cases will be misleading. This study proposes a strategy for addressing missing data in the English PROM survey using multiple imputation techniques and investigates its impact on assessing provider performance. We find that inferences about relative provider performance are sensitive to the assumptions made about the reasons for the missing data. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Chernozhukov et al. (2007) (CHT) develop a general theory of estimation and inference using the level set of a criterion function. We establish a dual relationship between the level-set estimator and its support function and show that the properly normalized support function provides alternative Wald-type inference methods. These methods can be used to obtain confidence sets for Theta(l), and points inside it. For models with finitely many moment inequalities, we show that our Wald-type statistic is asymptotically equivalent to CHT's statistic under regularity conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the compensating differential for employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI) and the welfare impact of reform in terms of sufficient statistics. We compare welfare under mandate-based reform to welfare in a counterfactual world where individuals do not value ESHI. Relying on the Massachusetts reform, we find that jobs with ESHI pay $2812 less annually, somewhat less than the cost of ESHI to employers. Accordingly, the deadweight loss of mandate-based health reform was approximately 8 percent of its potential size. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional QR econometric techniques lose their validity when predictors are highly persistent. I adopt and extend a methodology called IVX filtering (Magdalinos and Phillips, 2009) that is designed to handle predictor variables with various degrees of persistence. The proposed IVX-QR methods correct the distortion arising from persistent multivariate predictors while preserving discriminatory power. Simulations confirm that IVX-QR methods inherit the robust properties of QR. These methods are employed to examine the predictability of US stock returns at various quantile levels.

Evidence suggests that copayments generally reduce the level of healthcare utilization, although there is little specific evidence regarding the effectiveness of copayments in reducing nonurgent ED use among Medicaid enrollees or other low-income populations. Encouraging efficient and appropriate use of healthcare services will be of particular importance for Medicaid programs as they expand under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This analysis uses national data from 2001 to 2009 to examine the effect of copayments on nonurgent ED utilization among nonelderly adult enrollees. We find that visits among Medicaid enrollees in state-years where a copayment is in place are significantly less likely to be for nonurgent reasons. Our findings suggest that copayments may be an effective tool for reducing use of the ED for nonurgent care.

Structural breaks due to new policy implementation or major technological shocks, are more likely to occur over a longer time span. Consequently, ignoring structural breaks may lead to inconsistent estimation and invalid inference. We propose a general framework that includes heterogeneous panel data models and structural break models as special cases. The least squares method proposed by Bai (1997a, 2010) is applied to estimate the common change points, and the consistency of the estimated change points is established. We find that the CCE estimator have the same asymptotic distribution as if the true change points were known. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the main results of this paper.

The test uses power variations constructed as functionals of discretely observed diffusion processes. We introduce an orthogonality condition which stabilizes the limit law in the presence of parameter estimation and avoids the necessity for a bootstrap procedure that reduces performance and leads to complications associated with the structure of the diffusion process. The test has good finite sample performance as we demonstrate in numerical simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, a higher tax subsidy increases savings in any case but decreases medical utilization if and only if treatment expenses are above the deductible. A larger deductible increases savings but does not necessarily decrease healthcare utilization. Whether an HDHP/HSA combination is preferred over a full coverage contract depends on absolute risk aversion.

We use the fact that, under general assumptions, sample moments either converge to a finite number or diverge to infinity according as the corresponding population moment is finite or not. Building on this, we propose a test for the null that the kth moment does not exist. Since, by construction, our test statistic diverges under the null and converges under the alternative, we propose a randomised testing procedure to discern between the two cases. We study the application of the test to raw data, and to regression residuals. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the test has the correct size and good power; the results are further illustrated through an application to financial data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the implementation of this work, the group, considered a single climatic scenario and difined four strategies of adaptation incorporating both geographical mobility and of integration of technological changes, used assumptions from three sources: assumptions from researchers of various disciplines in their own disciplinary field, pre-existing assumptions from former foresight works and assumptions defined according to the statements of actors of the sector on the impacts of climate change and on the possible methods of adaptation. All these assumptions were written in the form of simple sentences, giving one version and its contrary. The various assumptions were selected and then combined between them in order to create a blend within the disciplinary fields, without however inferring of orientation. The result of this work is the join-construction of four plausible ways each one leading to one of the four preselected strategies of adaptation: conservative strategy where the evolutions are limited, a nomade strategy where the relocalisation of the vineyards is the main vector of adaptation, an innovating strategy where the adaptation is the result of the systematic integration of innovations, and finally towards a liberal strategy largely opened to any kind of changes. These ways and strategies are not supposed to give a predictive image of the future. However while proposing possible or plausible futures, this work provides material which could be debated within the sector, without immediate challenges that could possibly bias the discussion From the expression of the challenges and consequences of the various ways and strategies in which they result, the actors of the French wine sector will be able to start a strategic reflection. The presentation will be focused on the description of the four ways leading to adaptation strategies and their elaboration.

The problem consists in finding a distribution of a global 'safety emission budget' for the panning period 2010-2050, among the 28 countries in such a way to obtain a balanced relative loss of welfare (computed in percent of the discounted consumption in the reference case) when the countries supply strategically their permit endowment on a permit trading system with full banking and borrowing. We assume that the countries play a noncooperative game, where the payoffs are constituted of the gains from the terms of trade plus the gains in the permit trading and minus the abatement cost, expressed as the compensative variation of income. These payoff functions are estimated from an ensemble of numerical simulations of a detailed CGE model, GEMINIE3 representing the economic interactions among the 28 EU countries. To deal with the uncertainty introduced by the statistical emulation technique we propose to use the concept of robust equilibrium, where the results of robust optimization are exploited in the definition of an equilibrium solution, when the payoff is subject to uncertainties.

When the peer group is defined at the roommate level, we do not find any spillover effects on service use. When the peer group is defined at the hall level, we find positive spillover effects-peers' service use increases one's own service use- and this effect is driven by individuals with prior experience with mental health services.

Due to the importance of grape-berry bacterial in crop health, and the potential impact of copper fungicides over the microbiota, we determined Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of different copper formulations for bacterial species isolated from grape berries. We study the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of different copper formulations (copper sulphate (CuSO4) pure, Bordeaux mixture (CuSO4 + Ca(OH)2), copper oxide (Cu2O), copper hydroxide (Cu(OH) 2)) over 92 bacterial strains isolated from grape berries in different stages of the ripening process. The results of MIC measurements revealed that the different copper formulations have a variable inhibitory effect and among the different isolates, some species are the most resistant to all copper formulations than others.

On the other hand, the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other S-off-flavors favored by GSH addition are reported. To investigate the effect of glutathione on the color development, the sensory expression and the formation of sulfide off-flavors, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay grapes were processed under different conditions and musts were obtained with different phenolic contents. By the addition of GSH as a pure substance or the use of GSH-rich inactivated yeast preparations, the GSH concentration in the musts was varied. Bottled wines showed generally lower GSH levels than the corresponding musts. However, higher GSH concentrations after yeast aging could be determined, which may explain increased protection against oxidation during further storage. The sensory analysis after bottling showed that the fruity character of Riesling and Sauvignon blancs was enhanced at moderate GSH addition. Overuse of GSH in musts with low phenolic content, however, can lead to sensory perceptible S-off-flavors in the later wines.","[Wegmann-Herr, Pascal; Ullrich, Sebastian; Schmarr, Flans-Georg; Durner, Dominik] DLR Rheinpfalz, Inst Viticulture & Oenol, Breitenweg 71, D-67435 Neustadt, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Wegmann-Herr, P (通讯作者)，DLR Rheinpfalz, Inst Viticulture & Oenol, Breitenweg 71, D-67435 Neustadt, Germany.",pascal.wegmann-herr@dlr.rlp.de,,"Schmarr, Hans-Georg/0000-0003-1443-1162",,,,,9,9,9,0,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2031.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702031,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700075,0

It is crucial to know not only own-price elasticities but also cross-price elasticities, as food substitution patterns may have significant implications for policy recommendations. While own-price elasticities are common in analyses of the impact of food price changes on health, cross-price effects, even though generally acknowledged, are much less frequently included in analyses, especially in the public health literature. This article systematically reviews the global evidence on cross-price elasticities and provides combined estimates for seven food groups in low-income, middle-income and high-income countries alongside previously estimated own-price elasticities. Changes in food prices had the largest own-price effects in low-income countries. Cross-price effects were more varied and depending on country income level were found to be reinforcing, undermining or alleviating own-price effects.

Every individual has a job and a cut off time slot (deadline) where service beyond this slot is as worthless as not getting any service at all. Individuals are indifferent between slots which are not beyond their deadlines (compatible slots). A schedule (possibly random) assigns the set of slots to individuals by respecting their deadlines. We only consider the class of problems where for every set of relevant slots (compatible with at least one individual) there are at least as many individuals who have a compatible slot in that set: we ignore the case of underdemand. For this class, we characterize the random scheduling rule which attaches uniform probability to every efficient deterministic schedule (efficient uniform rule) by Pareto efficiency, equal treatment of equals, and probabilistic consistency (Chambers, 2004). We also show that a weaker version of the probabilistic consistency axiom is enough to achieve our result. Finally we show that efficient uniform rule is strategyproof. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper summarizes its main results. In the seven EuroHOPE countries, the Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), stroke and hip fracture patient populations were similar with regard to age, sex and comorbidity. However, non-negligible geographic variation in mortality and resource use was found to exist. Survival rates varied to similar extents between countries and regions for AMI, stroke, hip fracture and very low birth weight. Geographic variation in length of stay differed according to type of disease. Regression analyses showed that only a small part of geographic variation could be explained by demand and supply side factors. Furthermore, the impact of these factors varied between countries. The findings show that there is room for improvement in performance at all levels of analysis and call for more in-depth disease-based research. In using international patient-level data and a standardized methodology, the EuroHOPE approach provides a promising stepping-stone for future investigations in this field. Still, more detailed patient and provider information, including outside of hospital care, and better data sharing arrangements are needed to reach a more comprehensive understanding of geographic variations in health care.

Objectives: To compare the discriminatory power of this bolt-on and standard utility-based EQ-5D health indices. Methods: Cross-sectional data on the (3-level) vision bolt-on EQ-5D were collected through face-to-face interviews with 500 and 336 individuals with and without visual impairment, respectively. To assess the discriminatory power of the vision bolt-on index relative to the standard EQ-5D index developed in the vision bolt-on valuation study, 16 pairs of mutually exclusive subgroups of individuals defined by the individuals' visual acuity and responses to the 14-item visual function questionnaire were compared pairwise. The absolute mean difference in the two index scores and the corresponding F statistic derived from the comparisons were used as measures of discriminatory power. Results: The absolute mean difference in the bolt-on index score was larger than that in the standard EQ-5D index score in 14 of the 16 comparisons. The bolt-on index score exhibited a larger F-statistic value than did the standard EQ-5D index score in all known-group comparisons, with the F-statistic ratio ranging from 0.415 to 0.770. Conclusions: The vision bolt-on EQ-5D appears to be more discriminative than the standard EQ-5D in measurement of vision problems. Future studies should investigate the extent to which the vision bolt on item can increase the sensitivity of the EQ-5D to vision change in interventional studies.","[Luo, Nan; Wang, Xingzhi] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Block MD1,12 Sci Dr 2,10-01, Singapore 117549, Singapore; [Ang, Marcus; Aung, Tin; Wong, Tien-Yin; Lamoureux, Ecosse] Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Finkelstein, Eric A.; Aung, Tin; Wong, Tien-Yin; Lamoureux, Ecosse] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Aung, Tin; Wong, Tien-Yin; Lamoureux, Ecosse] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Ophthalmol, Singapore, Singapore; [Aung, Tin; Wong, Tien-Yin; Lamoureux, Ecosse] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Lamoureux, Ecosse] Univ Melbourne, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Eye Res Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Singapore National Eye Center; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Centre for Eye Research Australia; University of Melbourne,"Luo, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Block MD1,12 Sci Dr 2,10-01, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",ephln@nus.edu.sg,"Lamoureux, Ecosse/Z-5482-2019; Tin, Aung/B-6521-2009; ANG, Marcus Teck Meng/D-2239-2010; Wong, Tien Yin/AAC-9724-2020","Wong, Tien Yin/0000-0002-8448-1264; Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686",Ministry of Health of Singapore [HSRG/0037/2013],Ministry of Health of Singapore,This study was conducted using a Health Services Research Competitive Research Grant from the Ministry of Health of Singapore (grant no.

In these models, non-identification and weak identification present in multiple parts of the parameter space, resulting in mixed identification strength for different unknown parameters. This paper proposes robust tests and confidence intervals for sub-vectors and linear functions of the unknown parameters. In particular, the results cover applications where some nuisance parameters are non-identified under the null (Davies (1977, 1987)) and some nuisance parameters are subject to a full range of identification strength. To construct this robust inference procedure, we develop a local limit theory that models mixed identification strength. The asymptotic results involve both inconsistent estimators that depend on a localization parameter and consistent estimators with different rates of convergence. A sequential argument is used to peel the criterion function based on identification strength of the parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This implies an unexplained factor structure in the first pass residuals and, consequently, a large estimation error in the estimated beta's which is spanned by the beta's of the unexplained true factors. The average portfolio returns and the estimation error of the estimated beta's are then both linear in the beta's of the unobserved true factors which leads to possibly large values of the OLS R-2 of the second pass regression. These large values of the OLS R2 are not indicative of the strength of the relationship. Our results question many empirical findings that concern the relationship between expected portfolio returns and (macro-) economic factors. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We allow for substitution between different cigarette brands and also incorporate key features of rational addiction theory into the model. Results show that the average own-price elasticity of demand for cigarettes at the brand level is -0.807, and the overall price elasticity of cigarettes at the market level is -0.488 in China. We find tax-induced substitution toward low-price cigarettes as well as high-tar cigarettes and that tax hikes encourage within-class substitution more than across-class substitution. These results have important policy implications for the potential effects of cigarette taxation.

Methods: We used a longitudinal data set extracted from two waves (2004-2006) of the British Household Panel Survey, which includes information on smoking and a large number of socio-demographic variables. We modeled the effect of quitting smoking on body weight accounting for heterogeneous responses from individuals belonging to different clinical classes of body mass index (BMI) (i.e., overweight and obese individuals). National Health Service costs associated with smoking were then used to implement a cost-benefit analysis, comparing the advantages of smoking reductions with the costs associated with increased obesity. Results: The BMI was found to increase by 0.26 points for quitters compared with those who continued to smoke. The estimated BMI increase was larger for overweight (0.49 points) and obese (0.76 points) people. This result does not change when different control groups are examined. From an economic perspective, the National Health Service cost reductions attributable to quitting smoking were 156.81 million whereas the lost benefit for unintended increases in body weight was 24.07 million. Conclusions: This article found that the health benefits associated with quitting smoking are greater than the costs associated with increased overweight and obesity.","[Pieroni, Luca; Salmasi, L.] Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Minelli, L.] Univ Perugia, Publ Hlth Sect, Dept Expt Med, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Perugia,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",luca.pieroni@unipg.it,,"Minelli, Liliana/0000-0002-9535-0737; Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351; Salmasi, Luca/0000-0001-6674-9215",Public Health Department of the Umbria Region,Public Health Department of the Umbria Region,This work has been supported by a grant from the Public Health Department of the Umbria Region.,,25,2,3,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,791,799,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.06.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409606.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800008,0

Recently, the Thai government has addressed the issue of drug pricing, but the prices of single-source drugs remain a major challenge. Objective To examine equitable prices of single-source drugs in Thailand. Methods A total of 98 single-source and high-expenditure drugs were examined. Unit prices from the Drug and Medical Supplies Information Center (DMSIC) and National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) were used to represent drug prices at the provider level in Thailand and the US, respectively. Data for measuring drug affordability, eg, dose and poverty line, were obtained from Micromedex (R) online and the National Statistical Office (NSO). The US drug prices were adjusted by the Human Development Index (HDI) to be equitable prices for Thailand. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) was used to convert US currency into Thai baht. All prices in this study were based on the year 2012. Catastrophic, Impoverishment, and WHO/Health Action International (HAI) approaches were used to determine Thai citizens' ability to afford the study drugs. Finally, uncertainty analyses were conducted. Results From all study drugs, 55 single-source drugs were priced higher than their equitable prices, ranging from 0.38 to 422.36 % higher. Among these, 28 items were antineoplastic drugs. The prices of drugs outside the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), as well as the country's newer drugs, tended to be higher than their calculated equitable prices. The majority of drugs in Thailand priced higher than equitable prices were unaffordable for most Thai citizens. The uncertainty analyses revealed that almost all results were relatively robust. Conclusions Most single-source drug prices in Thailand were higher than their equitable prices, and were likely to be unaffordable to Thai citizens.","[Ngorsuraches, Surachat; Chaiyakan, Kanokkan] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Adm, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand",Prince of Songkla University,"Chaiyakan, K (通讯作者)，Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Adm, Hat Yai 90112, Songkhla, Thailand.",kanokkan.c@gmail.com,,"Ngorsuraches, Surachat/0000-0002-2327-224X",,,,,31,6,8,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

(2010). We extend their model by allowing for a duration dependent variable (mortality), and an ordinal educational variable. Data come from a Dutch cohort born between 1937 and 1941, including detailed measures of cognitive ability and family background in the final grade of primary school. The data are linked to the mortality register 1995-2011, such that we observe mortality between ages 55 and 75. The results suggest that at least half of the unconditional survival differences between educational groups are due to a 'selection effect', primarily on the basis of cognitive ability. Conditional survival differences across those having finished just primary school and those entering secondary education are still substantial, and amount to a 4 years gain in life expectancy, on average.

We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and assess effects up to seven years after care provision. The results suggest that there is a considerable negative short-term effect of informal care provision on mental health which fades out over time. Five years after care provision the effect is still negative but smaller and insignificant. Both short- and medium-term effects on physical health are virtually zero throughout. A simulation analysis is used to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to potential deviations from the conditional independence assumption in the regression adjusted matching approach.

Methods: We developed an age-structured population model of hepatitis A transmission dynamics to evaluate two policies of administering a two-dose hepatitis A vaccine to children aged 12 to 18 months: 1) universal routine vaccination as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in 2006 and 2) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices's previous regional policy of routine vaccination of children living in states with high hepatitis A incidence. Inputs were obtained from the published literature, public sources, and clinical trial data. The model was fitted to hepatitis A seroprevalence (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II and III) and reported incidence from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (1980-1995). We used a societal perspective and projected costs (in 2013 US $), quality-adjusted life years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and other outcomes over the period 2006 to 2106. Results: On average, universal routine hepatitis A vaccination prevented 259,776 additional infections, 167,094 outpatient visits, 4781 hospitalizations, and 228 deaths annually. Compared with the regional vaccination policy, universal routine hepatitis A vaccination was cost saving. In scenario analysis, universal vaccination prevented 94,957 infections, 46,179 outpatient visits, 1286 hospitalizations, and 15 deaths annually and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,223/quality-adjusted life year when herd protection was ignored. Conclusions: Our model predicted that universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination led to significant reductions in hepatitis A mortality and morbidity. Consequently, universal vaccination was cost saving compared with a regional vaccination policy. Herd protection effects of hepatitis A vaccination programs had a significant impact on hepatitis A mortality, morbidity, and cost-effectiveness ratios.","[Dhankhar, Praveen; Nwankwo, Chizoba; Pillsbury, Matthew; Lauschke, Andreas; Goveia, Michelle G.; Acosta, Camilo J.; Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ USA; [Dhankhar, Praveen] Complete HEOR Solut, N Wales, PA USA; [Lauschke, Andreas] Lauschke Consulting, Morris Plains, NJ USA",Merck & Company,"Elbasha, EH (通讯作者)，Merck Res Labs, UG1C-60,POB 1000, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",elamin_elbasha@merck.com,"Nwankwo, Chizoba/S-5264-2019",,,,,,54,26,28,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,358,367,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091589.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600002,0

Methods: Ex-factory price data as of December 2012 from New Zealand and 16 European countries were compared for a basket of 14 medicines, most of which were at least partially funded by the state in the 17 countries. Five medicines had, at least in some countries, generic versions on the market whose prices were also analyzed. Medicine price data for the 16 European countries were provided by the Pharma Price Information service. New Zealand medicine prices were retrieved from the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule. Unit prices converted into euro were compared at the ex-factory price level. Results: For the 14 medicines surveyed, considerable price differences at the ex-factory price level were identified. Within the European countries, prices in Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Spain ranked at the lower end, whereas prices in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were at the upper end. The results for New Zealand compared with Europe were variable. New Zealand prices were found in the lowest quartile for five medicines and in the highest quartile for seven other products. Price differences between the originator products and generic versions ranged from 0% to 90% depending on the medicine and the country. Conclusions: Medicine prices varied considerably between European countries and New Zealand as well as among the European countries. These differences are likely to result from national pricing and reimbursement policies.","[Vogler, Sabine] Gesundheit Osterreich GmbH Geschaftsbereich OBIG, WHO Collaborating Ctr Pharmaceut Pricing & Reimbu, Hlth Econ Dept, Austrian Hlth Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Kilpatrick, Kate] Waikato Hosp, Pharm Serv, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din] Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Pharm, Auckland 92019, New Zealand",Waikato Hospital; University of Auckland,"Babar, ZUD (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Sch Pharm, Private Mail Bag 92019, Auckland 92019, New Zealand.",z.babar@auckland.ac.nz,"Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din/AFQ-8221-2022","Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din/0000-0003-1051-3240; Vogler, Sabine/0000-0003-4853-4397",,,,,49,36,36,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,484,492,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091603.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600016,0

The CQIV estimator combines Powell (1986) censored quantile regression (CQR) to deal with censoring, with a control variable approach to incorporate endogenous regressors. The CQIV estimator is obtained in two stages that are nonadditive in the unobservables. The first stage estimates a nonadditive model with infinite dimensional parameters for the control variable, such as a quantile or distribution regression model. The second stage estimates a nonadditive censored quantile regression model for the response variable of interest, including the estimated control variable to deal with endogeneity. For computation, we extend the algorithm for CQR developed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2002) to incorporate the estimation of the control variable. We give generic regularity conditions for asymptotic normality of the CQIV estimator and for the validity of resampling methods to approximate its asymptotic distribution. We verify these conditions for quantile and distribution regression estimation of the control variable. Our analysis covers two-stage (uncensored) quantile regression with nonadditive first stage as an important special case. We illustrate the computation and applicability of the CQIV estimator with a Monte-Carlo numerical example and an empirical application on estimation of Engel curves for alcohol.

We demonstrate that the underlying definition of the value of information used in Celen (2012) is in contradiction with the principle of recursively defined utility. As a consequence, Celen's framework features dynamic inconsistency.

We show two main results for two-player games: an existence result and an almost-uniqueness result. Under a mild assumption, we show that any strategy profile that is Pareto efficient and strictly individually rational that is, strictly above each player's maximin value is generically a singleton vNM farsighted stable set. Moreover, there does not exist a vNM farsighted stable set that includes a strategy profile that is strictly individually rational and yields a payoff greater than the minimax value for a player, but not Pareto efficient.

After reviewing the tradeoffs associated with more- and less-disaggregated analyses, I update earlier state-level analyses of mortality and infant health and then consider how the estimated effects vary when the analysis is conducted at differing levels of geographic aggregation. This analysis reveals that the results are sensitive to the level of geographic aggregation with more-disaggregated analyses particularly county-level analyses routinely producing estimates that are smaller in magnitude. Further analyses suggest this is due to spillover effects of economic conditions on health outcomes across counties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, evidence shows that, in finite samples, the LM test referring to asymptotic critical values may suffer from the problems of size distortion and low power, which become worse with a denser spatial weight matrix. In this paper, residual-based bootstrap methods are introduced for asymptotically refined approximations to the finite sample critical values of the LM statistics. Conditions for their validity are clearly laid out and formal justifications are given in general, and in detail under several popular spatial LM tests using Edgeworth expansions. Monte Carlo results show that when the conditions are not fully met, bootstrap may lead to unstable critical values that change significantly with the alternative, whereas when all conditions are met, bootstrap critical values are very stable, approximate much better the finite sample critical values than those based on asymptotics, and lead to significantly improved size and power. The methods are further demonstrated using more general spatial LM tests, in connection with local misspecification and unknown heteroskedasticity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The key to safe drinking water is found in household water treatment and safe storage systems. Objective In this study, we assessed rural and urban household demand for a new gravity-driven membrane (GDM) drinking-water filter. Methods A choice experiment (CE) was used to assess the value attached to the characteristics of a new GDM filter before marketing in urban and rural Kenya. The CE was followed by a contingent valuation (CV) question. Differences in willingness to pay (WTP) for the same filter design were tested between methods, as well as urban and rural samples. Results The CV follow-up approach produces more conservative and statistically more efficient WTP values than the CE, with only limited indications of anchoring. The effect of the new filter technology on children with diarrhea is among the most important drivers behind choice behavior and WTP in both areas. The urban sample is willing to pay more in absolute terms than the rural sample irrespective of the valuation method. Rural households are more price sensitive, and willing to pay more in relative terms compared with disposable household income. Conclusion A differentiated marketing strategy across rural and urban areas is expected to increase uptake and diffusion of the new filter technology.","[Brouwer, Roy; van der Kroon, Bianca] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Environm Econ, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Job, Fumbi Crescent] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Johnston, Richard] World Hlth Org WHO, Geneva, Switzerland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); World Health Organization,"Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Environm Econ, Inst Environm Studies, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.brouwer@vu.nl,"Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,54,19,20,1,24,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Since then, the literature has hesitated between an ex ante approach that relaxes rationality (Diamond, 1967) and an ex post approach that fails the Pareto principle (Hammond, 1983; Broome, 1991). The Hammond Broome ex post approach conveniently retains the separable form of utilitarianism but does not make it explicit how to give priority to the worst-off, and how much disrespect of individual preferences this implies. Fleurbaey (2010) studies how to incorporate a priority for the worst-off in an explicit formulation, but leaves aside the issue of ex ante equity in lotteries, retaining a restrictive form of consequentialism. We extend the analysis to a framework allowing for ex ante equity considerations to play a role in the ex post evaluation, and find a richer configuration of possible criteria. But the general outlook of the Harsanyian dilemma is confirmed in this more general setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

In doing so, we postulate a working hypothesis to the effect that a journey involves the potential of an experience that requires some kind of bodily presence, in our case, the 'body' of the work of art or/and that of the viewer/interactant, and entails reminiscence bound up with the spatiotemporal coordinates of the experience. Digital art, we argue, globally accessible via the Web and determined by the medium it employs, denies itself this bodily presence and, by annihilating time and space boundaries and allowing its numerous, simultaneous viewers/interactants to engulf it in Benjamin's (The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction. In W. Benjamin Illuminations, pp. 217-51, Schocken Books, 1936/1968) terms, marks a radical change in the journey requirements referred to above. In the absence of a body, the distance between the work of art and the viewer is gone and the immersion that follows (see Polimeris, Digital Future and Art: Institutional Management Perspectives, Unpublished PhD dissertation, Athens, The Panteion University, 2011) results in loss of the spatiotemporal dimension and reminiscence. The digital or digitalized work of art somehow needs to 'pay' for its universal accessibility by becoming impossible to pin down and, thus, ever-elusive. Like the globalised era it is mostly a child of, it paradoxically combines immediacy and timelessness, lethe. Yet, as we go on to show, like the globalised era, the phenomenon can trace its roots back in times bygone.","[Polimeris, Spiros] Pante Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Athens, Greece; [Calfoglou, Christine] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Humanities, Patras, Greece",Panteion University; Hellenic Open University,"Polimeris, S (通讯作者)，Pante Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Athens, Greece.",spolimeris@yahoo.com; xkalfog@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,69,79,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_6,0.0,,,11,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000006,0

The system was setup with a micro-irrigation channel in the top of sheets to ensure circulation of hydroponic medium as hydroponic system. Eighteen days after transplanting, we took the root images by the standard RGB digital camera. To evaluate the root architecture parameters the SmartRoot software was used. The results showed that nutrient deficiency had effect on root architecture of winter wheat. N deficiency increase in total seminal root and lateral root length and root/shoot ratio, while P deficiency resulted in increase of mean root diameter, total root area when compared to the control. N deficiency also decreased root and shoot dry weight and total leaf area. However, nutrient deficiency slightly decreased lateral density. There was a slight effect of K deficiency on root architecture when compared to the complete nutrient application. The increasing of leaf dry weight was related with the increased of root dry weight.","[Rattanapichai, Wutthida; Klem, Karel] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Klem, Karel] CzechGlobe Global Change Res Ctr AS CR Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Rattanapichai, W (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xrattana@node.mendelu.cz,"Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014","Klem, Karel/0000-0002-6105-0429",,,,,12,0,0,10,51,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,78,83,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100013,0

Multiple stakeholder perspectives were brought together to better understand the issues encountered in pursuing social media as a form of data collection to support content validity. Presenters represented a pharmaceutical sponsor of clinical trials, a regulatory reviewer from the Food and Drug Administration, and an online data platform provider. Each presenter shared its perspective on the advantages and disadvantages of using social media to collect this type of information. There was consensus that there is great potential for using social media for this purpose. There remain, however, unanswered questions that need to be addressed such as identifying which type of social media is most appropriate for data collection and ensuring that participants are representative of the target population while maintaining the advantages of anonymity provided by online platforms. The use of social media to collect evidence of content validity holds much promise. Clarification of issues that need to be addressed and accumulation of empirical evidence to address these questions are essential to moving forward.

So it is available and useful to establish contact surfaces and contact points, to analyze seat surface morphology as well as to give the virtual test and evaluation if the automobile seat is comfortable or not.","[Zhang, Ping; Wen, Ya; Yuan, Quan; Zhang, Gen-wei] Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology,"Zhang, P (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei, Peoples R China.",Zhangp163@163.com,"yuan, quan/GZM-5597-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,1,11,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,393,395,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_79,0.0,,,3,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700079,0

With the panel data on the 7 industries above and the model for stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology (STIRPAT), the paper analyzed the relationship between the scale of carbon dioxide emission and employment, income, technology empirically, which revealed that employment promotes carbon dioxide emission while technology decreases the greenhouse effect. As for income, the influence on the emission isn't identical among those 7 sectors in China.","[Zhu Qing; Qu Shi-you] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhu, Q (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1555,1563,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600208,0

Cost-consequence analyses are recommended and employed by the English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) to help address these challenges. The aim of this work was to review the critiques raised for previous MTEP submissions and explore if there were common problems across submissions. We reviewed a sample of 12 economic submissions to MTEP representing 50 % of 24 sets of guidance issued to July 2015. For each submission, we reviewed the External Assessment Centre's (EAC) report and the guidance document produced by NICE. We identified the main problems raised by the EAC's assessments and the committee's considerations for each submission, and explored strategies for improvement. We found that the identification and measurement of costs and consequences are the main shortcomings within economic submissions to MTEP. Together, these shortcomings accounted for 42 % of criticisms by the EACs among the reviewed submissions. In certain circumstances problems with these shortcomings may be unavoidable, for example, if there is a limited evidence base for the device being appraised. Nevertheless, strategies can often be adopted to improve submissions, including the use of more appropriate time horizons, whilst cost and resource use information should be taken, where possible, from nationally representative sources.","[Alshreef, Abualbishr; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Jenks, Michelle; Green, William] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of York - UK,"Alshreef, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",a.o.alshreef@sheffield.ac.uk,"Green, William/HGB-7114-2022; Alshreef, Abualbishr/AAW-9791-2021","Alshreef, Abualbishr/0000-0003-2737-1365; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009; Jenks, Michelle/0000-0002-1637-1506",Yorkshire and Humber Academic Health Sciences Network (YHAHSN),Yorkshire and Humber Academic Health Sciences Network (YHAHSN),"This work was funded by Yorkshire and Humber Academic Health Sciences Network (YHAHSN), though the views expressed in this article are the authors' own views.",,41,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

An issue with their adoption is that results may be sensitive to the order in which dimensions of health are presented in the valuation task. Findings in the literature regarding order effects are discordant at present. Objectives: To quantify the magnitude of order effect of quality-of-life (QOL) dimensions within the context of a DCE designed to produce country-specific value sets for the EORTC Quality of Life Utility Measure-Core 10 dimensions (QLU-C10D), a new utility instrument derived from the widely used cancer-specific QOL questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30. Methods: The DCE comprised 960 choice sets, divided into 60 versions of 16 choice sets, with each respondent assigned to a version. Within each version, the order of QLU-C1OD QOL dimensions was randomized, followed by life duration in the last position. The DCE was completed online by 2053 individuals in France and Germany. We analyzed the data with a series of conditional logit models, adjusted for repeated choices within respondent. We used F tests to assess order effects, correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. Results: Each F test failed to reject the null hypothesis of no position effect: 1) all QOL order positions considered jointly; 2) last QOL position only; 3) first QOL position only. Furthermore, the order coefficients were small relative to those of the QLU-C1OD QOL dimension levels. Conclusions: The order of presentation of QOL dimensions within a DCE designed to provide utility weights for the QLU-C1OD had little effect on level coefficients of those QOL dimensions.","[Norman, Richard] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Kemmler, Georg; Gamper, Eva; Holzner, Bernhard] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Innsbruck, Austria; [Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pickard, A.

Treatment is determined by location of a latent variable (containing a continuous instrument) relative to two or more thresholds. We place no functional form restrictions on latent errors and potential outcomes. Unconfoundedness of treatment does not hold and identification at infinity for the treated is not possible. Yet we still show nonparametric point identification and estimation of the ATE. We apply our model to reinvestigate the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation, and find no inverted-U in US data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assuming that the remaining noise is O-p (1/ root n), allowing irregular times and jumps, we show that we can estimate the parameters at rate n, and propose a volatility estimator which enjoys convergence rate. Simulation studies show that our method performs well even with model misspecification and rounding. Empirical studies demonstrate the practical relevance and advantages of our method. Furthermore, we find that a simple model can account for a high percentage of the total variation in microstructure noise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, strategy-proof location problems in a vast class of networks fall under the scope of that proposition. It is also established that a much weaker minimal anti-exchangeproperty is necessary to ensure equivalence of simple and coalitional strategy-proofness in that setting. An immediate corollary to that result is that such equivalence fails to hold both in certain median interval spaces including those induced by bounded distributive lattices that are not chains, and in certain non-median interval spaces including those induced by partial cubes that are not trees. Thus, it turns out that anti-exchange properties of the relevant interval space provide a powerful general common principle that explains the varying relationship between simple and coalitional strategy-proofness of aggregation rules for rich weakly unimodal domains across different interval spaces, both median and non-median.

Our formulation of the macro finance model in continuous time conveniently accounts for the difference in observation frequency. We suggest the use of martingale estimating functions (MEF) to infer the structural parameters of the model directly through a nonlinear scheme. This method is compared to regression-based methods and the generalized method of moments (GMM). We illustrate our approaches by estimating various versions of the AK-Vasicek model with mean-reverting interest rates. We provide asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo evidence on the small sample behavior of the estimators and report empirical estimates using 30 years of US macro and financial data.

Using a theoretical model, I show that public insurance is adversely selected when insurers and insureds are symmetrically informed about health-related risks, and that there can be adverse or advantageous selection when insureds are privately informed. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, I find that (i) public insurance is, on balance, adversely selected under the German public health insurance with opt out scheme, (ii) individuals advantageously select public insurance based on risk aversion and residential location, and (iii) there is suggestive evidence of asymmetric information in the market for private health insurance.

Health-state utility (HSU) estimates (the preference for a given state of health on a cardinal scale where 0 represents dead and 1 represents full health) are typically among the most important and uncertain data inputs in cost-utility models. Clinical trials represent an important opportunity for the collection of health-utility data. However, trials designed primarily to evaluate efficacy and safety often present challenges to the optimal collection of HSU estimates for economic models. Careful planning is needed to determine which of the HSU estimates may be measured in planned trials; to establish the optimal methodology; and to plan any additional studies needed. This report aimed to provide a framework for researchers to plan the collection of health-utility data in clinical studies to provide high-quality HSU estimates for economic modeling. Recommendations are made for early planning of health-utility data collection within a research and development program; design of health-utility data collection during protocol development for a planned clinical trial; design of prospective and cross-sectional observational studies and alternative study types; and statistical analyses and reporting.","[Wolowacz, Sorrel E.; Doward, Lynda] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment Res Grp, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Belozeroff, Vasily] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Clarke, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Goeree, Ron] Goeree Consulting Ltd, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Lloyd, Andrew] Bladon Associates Ltd, Oxford, England; [Norman, Richard] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Curtin, WA, Australia",Research Triangle Institute; University of Glasgow; Amgen; University of Melbourne; McMaster University; Curtin University,"Wolowacz, SE (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"Norman, Richard P/B-4290-2009; Doward, Lynda/IXD-2462-2023; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Doward, Lynda/0000-0002-6236-469X; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Clarke, Philip/0000-0002-7555-5348; Wolowacz, Sorrel/0000-0001-5497-612X; Norman, Richard/0000-0002-3112-3893",,,,,66,93,99,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,704,719,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.06.001,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712695.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500004,0

Given the implications of PBAC recommendations for government finances and population health, PBAC is required to provide advice primarily on the basis of value for money. The aim of this article is twofold: to describe some major limitations of the current PBAC decision-making process in relation to its implicit aim of maximising value for money; and to suggest what might be done toward overcoming these limitations. This should also offer lessons for the many decision-making bodies around the world that are similar to PBAC. The current PBAC decision-making process is limited in two important respects. First, it features the use of an implicit incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold that may not reflect the opportunity cost of funding a new technology, with unknown and possibly negative consequences for population health. Second, the process does not feature a means of systematically assessing how a technology may be of greater or lesser value in light of factors that are not captured by standard measures of cost effectiveness, but which are nonetheless important, particularly to the Australian community. Overcoming these limitations would mean that PBAC could be more confident of maximising value for money when making funding decisions.","[Carter, Drew; Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Vogan, Arlene] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide Hlth Technol Assessment, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Carter, D (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",drew.carter@adelaide.edu.au,"Carter, Drew/A-8430-2012","Carter, Drew/0000-0002-1221-6656",'Health Care in the Round' Capacity Building Grant in Population Health (National Health and Medical Research Council) [565501],'Health Care in the Round' Capacity Building Grant in Population Health (National Health and Medical Research Council),Drew Carter and Hossein Haji Ali Afzali are supported by the 'Health Care in the Round' Capacity Building Grant in Population Health (National Health and Medical Research Council Grant ID 565501).,,44,13,13,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost utility of rituximab-bendamustine treatment compared with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) treatment as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced FL in Spain. Methods A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of rituximab-bendamustine compared with R-CHOP as first-line treatment for patients with advanced FL in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Transitions between health states (progression-free, including induction and maintenance; first relapse; second relapse; and death) were allowed for the patient cohort in 4-week-long cycles. Clinical data for the extrapolation of progression-free survival curves were obtained from randomized trials. Mortality rates and utilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs ((sic), 2013) included drug costs (ex-factory prices with mandatory deductions), disease management costs and adverse event-associated costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % annual rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess the model robustness. Results Treatment and administration costs during the induction phase were higher for rituximab-bendamustine ((sic)17,671) than for R-CHOP ((sic)11,850). At the end of the 25-year period, the rituximab-bendamustine first-line strategy had a total cost of (sic)68,357 compared with (sic)69,528 for R-CHOP. Health benefits were higher for rituximab-bendamustine treatment (10.31 QALYs) than for R-CHOP treatment (9.82 QALYs). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab-bendamustine was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP in 53.4 % of the simulations. Conclusion First-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine in FL patients was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP; it showed cost savings and higher health benefits for the Spanish NHS.","[Sabater, Eliazar; Oyaguez, Itziar] Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res Iberia, Paseo Joaquin Rodrigo 4 Letra 1, Madrid 28224, Spain; [Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Dept Haematol, Barcelona, Spain; [Rueda, Antonio] Hosp Costa del Sol, Dept Oncol, Marbella, Spain; [Salar, Antonio] Hosp del Mar, Dept Haematol, Barcelona, Spain; [Manuel Collar, Juan] Mundipharma Pharmaceut, Dept Med, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar,"Sabater, E (通讯作者)，Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res Iberia, Paseo Joaquin Rodrigo 4 Letra 1, Madrid 28224, Spain.",esabater@porib.com,"Oyagüez, Itziar/L-2185-2019; Salar, Antonio/HJY-3106-2023; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando/Z-5684-2019","Oyagüez, Itziar/0000-0002-3047-6152; Salar, Antonio/0000-0002-4652-4825","Mundipharma Pharmaceuticals, S.L.

This has resulted in significant delays in service provision. In response, Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinics and Multidisciplinary Services (OPSC) have been introduced to assess and co-ordinate care for semi-and non-urgent patients. Objectives To compare the efficiency of delivering increased semi-and non-urgent orthopaedic outpatient services through: (1) additional OPSC services; (2) additional traditional orthopaedic medical services with added surgical resources (TOMS + Surg); or (3) additional TOMS without added surgical resources (TOMS - Surg). Methods A cost-utility analysis using discrete event simulation (DES) with dynamic queuing (DQ) was used to predict the cost effectiveness, throughput, queuing times, and resource utilisation, associated with introducing additional OPSC or TOMS +/- Surg versus usual care. Results The introduction of additional OPSC or TOMS (+/- surgery) would be considered cost effective in Australia. However, OPSC was the most cost-effective option. Increasing the capacity of current OPSC services is an efficient way to improve patient throughput and waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources. An OPSC capacity increase of similar to 100 patients per month appears cost effective (A$8546 per quality-adjusted life-year) and results in a high level of OPSC utilisation (98 %). Conclusion Increasing OPSC capacity to manage semi- and non-urgent patients would be cost effective, improve throughput, and reduce waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources. Unlike Markov cohort modelling, microsimulation, or DES without DQ, employing DES-DQ in situations where capacity constraints predominate provides valuable additional information beyond cost effectiveness to guide resource allocation decisions.","[Standfield, L.; Comans, T.; Moretto, N.; Scuffham, P.] Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Standfield, L.; Comans, T.; Moretto, N.; Scuffham, P.] Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Comans, T.] Metro North Hosp & Hlth Serv, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Raymer, M.; O'Leary, S.] Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Metro North Hosp & Hlth Serv, Physiotherapy Dept, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [O'Leary, S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Physiotherapy Dept, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital; University of Queensland,"Standfield, L (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.;Standfield, L (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",lachlan.standfield@griffithuni.edu.au,"Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Comans, Tracy/D-9308-2018; Moretto, Nicole/R-5695-2018","Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Comans, Tracy/0000-0003-2840-3496; Moretto, Nicole/0000-0001-7999-608X",,,,,20,26,26,1,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

As with most of NICE's other programs, the clinical guidelines program also must take into account the relative costs and benefits of interventions when deciding whether to recommend them. The three main advantages of the program are that 1) it represents an important collaboration with the medical profession, thereby increasing the likelihood of recommendations being adopted; 2) the guidelines provide an opportunity to review all aspects of the clinical pathway, rather than focusing on only the adoption of a new technology; and 3) the guidelines offer the potential to discuss disinvestment as well as new investment. All the guidelines contain a systematic review of the relevant economic evaluation literature, and the 12 guidelines published from January 1 to August 31, 2015, contain 28 de novo economic analyses. The main challenges encountered in the guidelines program are that 1) there is an inevitable tension in advising on the quality of care that individual patients could expect while recognizing the broader public health objectives of equity, fairness, and efficiency; 2) the impact of economics is sometimes lessened because of the lack of time to conduct de novo analyses; and 3) unlike NICE's technology appraisal program, the adoption of recommendations is not mandatory for the UK National Health Service.","[Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Drummond, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mike.drummond@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,22,22,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,525,530,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.020,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565268.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600005,0

Methods: A discrete-event simulation model was built to represent KA utilization for 20 years (2012-2031) in the Spanish National Health System. Data on KA utilization from 1997 to 2011 were obtained from the minimum data set. Three scenarios of future utilization of primary KA (1, fixed number since 2011; 2, fixed age- and sex adjusted rates since 2011; and 3, projection using a linear regression model) were combined with two prosthesis survival functions (W [worse survival], from a study including primary KA from 1995 to 2000; and B [better survival], from the Catalan Registry of Arthroplasty, including primary KA from 2005 to 2013). The simulation results were analyzed in the short-term (2015) and the long-term (2030). Results: Variations in the number of revisions depended on both the primary utilization rate and the survival function applied, ranging from increases of 8.3% to 31.6% in the short- term and from 38.3% to 176.9% in the long-term, corresponding to scenarios 1-B and 3-W, respectively. The prediction of increases in overall surgeries ranged from 0.1% to 22.3% in the short-term and from 3.7% to 98.2% in the long-term. Conclusions: Projections of the burden of KA provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions on the concentration of high-complexity procedures, the number of orthopedic surgeons required to perform these procedures, and the resources needed.","[Guerrero-Luduena, Richard E.; Comas, Merce; Castells, Xavier] Hosp del Mar Med Res Inst IMIM, Epidemiol & Evaluat Dept, Passeig Maritim 25-29, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Comas, Merce; Espallargues, Mireia; Castells, Xavier] Red Invest Serv Salud Enfermedades Cron REDISSEC, Hlth Serv Res Chron Patients Network, Barcelona, Spain; [Espallargues, Mireia; Allepuz, Alejandro] Agencia Qualitat & Aualuacio Sanitaries Catalunya, Agency Hlth Qual & Assessment Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain; [Coll, Moises] Hosp Mataro, Traumatol & Orthopaed Surg Dept, Mataro, Spain; [Pons, Miquel] Hosp St Rafael, Traumatol & Orthopaed Surg Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Sabates, Santiago] Hosp Mutua Terrassa, Traumatol & Orthopaed Surg Dept, Terrassa, Spain",Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; Hospital Universitario Mutua Terrassa,"Comas, M (通讯作者)，Hosp del Mar Med Res Inst IMIM, Epidemiol & Evaluat Dept, Passeig Maritim 25-29, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",mcomas@parcdesalutmar.cat,"Buron, Andrea/E-5705-2016; Castells, Xavier/S-7798-2016; Comas, Merce/O-3825-2014; Guerrero-Luduena, Richard/F-6903-2016; Coll, Moises/H-6581-2014","Buron, Andrea/0000-0003-3590-1303; Castells, Xavier/0000-0002-2528-0382; Comas, Merce/0000-0003-1926-2740; Guerrero-Luduena, Richard/0000-0002-1217-015X; Coll, Moises/0000-0002-4097-8375","Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality","Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality","This research has been produced under the collaboration agreement signed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, an autonomous body of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and the Agencia de Qualitat i Avaluacio Sanitaries de Catalunya (AQuAS), under the development of activities of the Spanish Network of Health Technology and Health Services Provision Assessment Agencies of the National Health Service, funded by the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.",,35,13,13,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,680,687,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.018,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565286.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600023,0

A novel feature of this study is that the empirical work is guided by insights from behavioral economic theory. Unlike the theory used in most prior studies, this theory predicts that restriction on alcohol advertising on TV would be more effective in reducing consumption for individuals with high consumption levels but less effective for individuals with low consumption levels. The estimation work employs data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and the empirical model is estimated with quantile regressions. The results show that advertising has a small positive effect on consumption and that this effect is relatively larger at high consumption levels. The continuing importance of alcohol taxes is also supported. Education is employed as a proxy for self-regulation, and the results are consistent with this assumption. The key conclusion is that restrictions on alcohol advertising on TV would have a small negative effect on drinking, and this effect would be larger for heavy drinkers.

This paper analyzes the effect of quasi-hyperbolic discounting, i.e. time-inconsistent preferences on the exercise timing of such options to defer an investment. It complements earlier work on this issue covering risk aversion and capital market interaction. The results are as follows: In a number of cases, the capital market environment provides for the irrelevance of quasi-hyperbolic discounting. Besides this, a different behavior of time-inconsistent and time-consistent decision makers occurs only for quite specific parameter conditions. In light of experimental evidence for time-inconsistent behavior, this provokes the following question: Is time-inconsistent behavior really driven by quasi-hyperbolic discounting, but rather by more fundamental irrationality (like a disregard of fairly ubiquitous market opportunities)?

However, little is known about the national decision-making procedures. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the evidence used for the development of recommendations and its impact on the choice of target groups in France and the Netherlands. Methods: A preliminary documentary analysis identified institutions to include in the assessment: governmental authorities, research institutions, associations, and manufacturers. At least one expert from each group was invited to our study. Thirty-three semi structured interviews were conducted in 2013 (16 France, 17 the Netherlands). We used NVivo108 to perform a thematic content analysis. Results: Clinical/epidemiological studies were the evidence most used in both countries. Economic models were increasingly being used; these had greater influence on the decision making in the Netherlands than in France, probably because of the presence of a modeler. Generally, the quality of the evidence used was poor, although no systematic use of standard protocol for its assessment was observed. A general protocol was sometimes used in France; however, the personal judgment of the experts was crucial for the assessment in both countries. Conclusions: There were differences in the target groups, for example, pregnant women, recommended only in France. France and the Netherlands use similar evidence for developing vaccination recommendations, although different decisions are sometimes made regarding target groups. This could be associated with the lack of systematic standard appraisals, increasing the influence of the experts' judgment on decision making. The development of standards for the appraisal of evidence is recommended.","[Silva, Maria Laura; Buthion, Valerie; Perrier, Lionel; Spath, Hans Martin] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France; [Silva, Maria Laura] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux Populat Hlth Res Ctr, INSERM, U1219, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Silva, Maria Laura; Perrier, Lionel] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, GATE LSE UMR 5824, Ecully, France; [Paget, W.

Methods: Analyzing data from 3,610 cancer survivors and 59,539 individuals without cancer in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined the relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL, taking remission status into account and controlling for patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities. HRQOL measurements included the six dimensional health state short form (derived from 36-item short form health survey) (SF-6D) utility scores, the physical component summary score, and the mental component summary score. Results: The relationship between time since cancer diagnosis and HRQOL varied substantially across cancer types. Compared with individuals without cancer, survivors of breast, prostate, or poor-prognosis cancer had statistically lower SF-6D scores within 2 years of diagnosis (-0.044, 0.062, and 0.088, respectively). Breast cancer survivors had SF-6D scores similar to those of individuals without cancer after 2 years, as did patients with poor-prognosis cancer after 5 years. Nevertheless, even after a period of 10 years, survivors of prostate or cervical cancer had a lower level of SF-6D scores (-0.027 and 0.042, respectively). The comparisons of physical health between cancer survivors and individuals without cancer were similar to those of SF-6D. In contrast, most cancer survivors did not experience poorer mental health; survivors of prostate or cervical cancer, however, had lower mental component summary scores after 10 years of diagnosis. Conclusions: The level of HRQOL among cancer survivors depends on time since cancer diagnosis and cancer type. Some cancer survivors have lower HRQOL after a decade of diagnosis, even in remission.","[Wang, Shi-Yi; Gross, Cary P.; Sanft, Tara; Davidoff, Amy J.; Ma, Xiaomei; Yu, James B.] Yale Canc Ctr, Canc Outcomes Publ Policy & Effectiveness Res Ctr, New Haven, CT USA; [Wang, Shi-Yi; Gross, Cary P.; Sanft, Tara; Davidoff, Amy J.; Ma, Xiaomei; Yu, James B.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Wang, Shi-Yi; Hsu, Sylvia H.; Ma, Xiaomei] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Chron Dis Epidemiol, New Haven, CT USA; [Hsu, Sylvia H.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gross, Cary P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Gen Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sanft, Tara] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Med Oncol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Davidoff, Amy J.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, New Haven, CT USA; [Yu, James B.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Therapeut Radiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",Yale University; Yale University; Yale University; York University - Canada; Yale University; Yale University; Yale University; Yale University,"Wang, SY (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Chron Dis Epidemiol, 60 Coll St,POB 208034, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",shiyi.wang@yale.edu,,"Yu, James/0000-0002-3119-3226; Wang, Shi-Yi/0000-0002-3294-5784",National Cancer Institute [P30 CA016359]; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [1K01HS023900-01],National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (grant no.

The double asymptotic theory assumes the sample size diverges because the sampling interval (h) shrinks to zero and the time span (N) diverges. Both the simultaneous and sequential double asymptotic distributions are derived. In contrast to the long-time span asymptotics (N -> infinity with fixed h) where no invariance principle applies, the double asymptotic distribution is derived without assuming Gaussian errors, so an invariance principle applies, as the asymptotic theory for the mildly explosive process developed by Phillips and Magdalinos (2007). Like the in-fill asymptotics (h 0 with fixed N) of Perron (1991), the double asymptotic distribution explicitly depends on the initial condition. The convergence rate of the double asymptotics partially bridges that of the long-time-span asymptotics and that of the in-fill asymptotics. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the double asymptotic distribution works well in practically realistic situations and better approximates the finite sample distribution than the asymptotic distribution that is independent of the initial condition. Empirical applications to real Nasdaq prices highlight the difference between the new theory and the theory without taking the initial condition into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Exogenous RP results in MPs at both high-price and low-price firms converging towards the reference price from above and below, respectively. Endogenous RP results in MPs at both high-price and low-price firms decreasing, with low-price firms acting strategically to decrease the reference price in order to gain market share. We extend these models to a hospital context focusing on insurer and consumer payments. Under exogenous RP, insurer and consumer payments to low-price hospitals increase, and insurer payments to high-price hospitals decrease, but predictions regarding consumer payments are ambiguous for high-price hospitals. Under endogenous RP, insurer payments to high-price and low-price hospitals decrease, and consumer payments to low-price hospitals decrease, but predictions regarding consumer payments are ambiguous for high-price hospitals. We test these predictions with difference-in-differences specifications using 2008-2013 data on patients undergoing joint replacement. For 2years following RP implementation, insurer payments to high-price and low-price hospitals moved downward, consistent with endogenous RP. However, when the reference price was not reset to account for changes in MPs, insurer payments to low-price hospitals reverted to pre-implementation levels, consistent with exogenous RP.

Our model shows that the probabilities of matches in a thin market are significantly lower than those in a thick market. When applying our results to a job search model, it implies that, if the ratio of job candidates to job openings remains (roughly) a constant, the probability that a person can find a job is higher in a thick market than in a thin market. We apply our matching model to the U.S. academic market for new PhD economists. Consistent with the prediction of our model, a field of specialization with more job openings and more candidates has a higher probability of matching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This method is applicable not only to averaging longitudinal data models, but also to averaging time series models which can have heteroscedastic errors.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether price changes for different treatments affect the number of patients treated and the mix of activity provided by hospitals. We exploit the variations in prices created by the changes in the national average treatment cost per diagnosis-related group (DRG) offered to Norwegian hospitals over a period of 5years (2003-2007). We use the data from Norwegian Patient Register, containing individual-level information on age, gender, type of treatment, diagnosis, number of co-morbidities and the national average treatment costs per DRG. We employ fixed-effect models to examine the changes in the number of patients treated within the DRGs over time. The results suggest that a 10% increase in price leads to about 0.8-1.3% increase in the number of patients treated for DRGs, which are medical (for both emergency and elective patients). In contrast, we find no price effect for DRGs that are surgical (for both emergency and elective patients). Moreover, we find evidence of upcoding. A 10% increase in the ratio of prices between patients with and without complications increases the proportion of patients coded with complications by 0.3-0.4 percentage points.
