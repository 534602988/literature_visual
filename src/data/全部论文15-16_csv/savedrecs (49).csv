Recognizing the threats posed by climate change, the Durban Platform, the 17th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP 17), underscores that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation and ambitious action by all countries. A crucial starting point for the design of effective and publicly acceptable policies is to explore public preferences for climate policy instruments. Using a choice experiment, this study investigates public preferences for carbon tax attributes in a developing country context. The results account for heterogeneity in preferences and show that Turkish people prefer a carbon tax with a progressive cost distribution rather than one with a regressive cost distribution. The private cost has a negative effect on the probability of choosing the tax. Earmarking carbon tax revenues increases the public acceptability of the tax. Moreover, there is a preference for a carbon tax that promotes public awareness of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Gevrek, Z.

The study finds that households whose principal occupation is aquaculture commit more resources to embankment maintenance relative to those in non-aquaculture employment. While conservation efforts are greater in all types of aquaculture plots irrespective of distance from the embankments, such efforts unambiguously decrease for agricultural plots that are located at a distance from the embankments. Private returns to traditional aquaculture are much higher than returns to agriculture, enabling aquaculture households in invest in managing their local public good. However, there is evidence of free riding in canal-based aquaculture when multiple users draw water from a single source. Head-enders with greater wealth as well as intense social networks tend to free-ride while tail-enders with less land holdings contribute more towards canal maintenance. Furthermore, public intervention in embankment maintenance may be crowding out private efforts. Thus, in primarily agricultural areas, productivity-enhancing policies like adoption of salt tolerant crops with supportive extension activities may be more efficient than policies that fully subsidize public good maintenance.

Coloring a discourse that could have been political, technical or economic in securitization rhetoric is especially prominent in the literature and policy on the securitization of transboundary water. However, despite the tendency to address water as a securitized resource, it is often unclear what the term water security means. Also, unclear are the contextual variables that trigger the use of such discourse; the way in which securitization is institutionalized; and its impacts on the decision-making process. This paper aims to systematically review the missing gaps around the securitization enigma. It also provides a rudimentary typology for potential mechanisms to securitize the water discourse and their potential impact on decision-making processes. Among the mechanisms identified are structural ones such as setting buffer zones around water infrastructure; institutional ones such as the exclusion of civil society from decision-making processes; and linguistic ones such as the use of framing and narratives for justifying military involvements. The securitization of the discourse is not likely to be distributed equally in time and space and is likely to be triggered by disasters, resource scarcity and power asymmetry. Some institutional venues are likely to be more receptive to such rhetoric.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Fischhendler, I (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, Jerusalem, Israel.",fishi@mscc.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,78,43,48,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It shows that credit terms consistently varied between American colonies, and that slave ship captains considered these differences when electing where to land enslaved Africans. Our dataset also shows that credit terms were highly erratic, especially in the last quarter of the century, contributing to both surges and collapses in the slave trade to individual colonies, and in the trade as a whole. Four such instances are examined in detail to show that instability in credit terms played an important and hitherto unacknowledged role in the volume and direction of Britain's trans-Atlantic slave trade in the second one-half of the eighteenth century.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hist, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Radburn, N (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hist, 301 Gilman Hall,3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",nradbur1@jhu.edu,,"Radburn, Nicholas/0000-0001-9941-2264",,,,,64,15,19,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

In this context, legal texts convey messages and shape public actions, but have been rarely considered in the analysis of water securitization. Moreover, security is usually meant as the absence of violent conflict, while discourse securitization can exist also where there are only vaguely defined threats to the society. This may be the case of water scarcity associated with drought. This paper undertakes a policy frame analysis of nine exceptional laws passed in Spain during the 2005-2008 drought, to address the following questions: To what extent and how can the water discourse in legal texts be securitized? and What are the consequences of that securitization? The analysis shows that securitization is achieved using both linguistic and institutional mechanisms. Dry spells are presented as exceptional situations and using alarmist terms, even if drought is inherent to Spain's Mediterranean climate. The sense of urgency is used to fast-track the approval of measures that could be part of ordinary water planning. The securitization of the water discourse contributes to consolidate an existing water paradigm, which, in the case of Spain, is based on State-subsidized, technical and legal measures addressing water scarcity (real or exaggerated). It is an example of a creeping securitization of the water discourse, meant as the dramatization of otherwise natural circumstances to spur projects and investments conceived for other purposes.","[Urquijo, Julia; De Stefano, Lucia] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Geol, Dept Geodinam, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [De Stefano, Lucia] Fdn Botin, Observ Agua, Madrid, Spain; [La Calle, Abel] Fdn Nueva Cultura Agua, Almeria, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"De Stefano, L (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Geol, Dept Geodinam, C Jose Antonio Novais 12, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",juliaurquijo@gmail.com; lstefano@ucm.es; abel.lacalle@gmail.com,"Urquijo Reguera, Julia/HPE-0056-2023; Reguera, Julia Urquijo/S-6673-2019; De Stefano, Lucia/H-2085-2015","Urquijo Reguera, Julia/0000-0001-5632-7959; De Stefano, Lucia/0000-0002-9612-7051",EU-project Fostering European Drought Research and Science-Policy Interfacing'' (DROUGHT RSPI),EU-project Fostering European Drought Research and Science-Policy Interfacing'' (DROUGHT RSPI),"The authors are thankful to Maria Bustelo, Ana M.

The ongoing nature of today's environmental crisis also raises questions about inequality's role in environmental deterioration. Despite the large number of papers that have been written on this topic, no theoretical or empirical consensus presently exists. Firstly, our article identifies that authors' conclusions in this area depend on their hypotheses regarding 1) the relationship between individual income and individual environmental pressure, 2) the impact of inequality on the social norms that influence individual environmental pressure, 3) the interests that social groups have in degrading or protecting the environment, 4) how these interests play out in terms of political demands, and 5) how these political demands translate into political decisions. Secondly, the study shows that, despite enabling a general test of the causal relationship between inequality and the environment, the empirical methods utilised do not account for the full range of theoretical mechanisms in play. Hence the suggestion that a research programme be launched to conduct empirical studies of the five aforementioned hypotheses by applying a recursive approach. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Socially responsible investors - who were part of fringe movements headed by non-profit organizations - have emerged as powerful fiduciaries with a strong focus on triple-bottom line based outcomes. The slow money movement, which has been spear-headed by non-profits in the developed world, places a strong emphasis on making capital circulate locally, especially within agricultural communities. Slow money investors across the US, some of whom are private investment funds and community development financial institutions, are striving to generate triple-bottom line based outcomes. In our study, we have discussed how the slow money movement mirrors fiduciary capitalism. We have analyzed how slow money investors have expanded the scope of traditional fiduciary obligations. Five organizations in the US have participated in our research and we developed a seven-point taxonomy of slow money to analyze our findings.

We examine changes in wildland fire patterns based on the U.S. Forest Service's MC1 dynamic global vegetation model from 2013 to 2115 under two pre-defined scenarios: a reference (i.e., business-as-usual) and a greenhouse gas mitigation policy scenario. We construct a habitat equivalency model under which fuels management activities, actions commonly undertaken to reduce the frequency and/or severity of wildland fire, are used to compensate for climate change-induced losses in ecosystem services on conservation lands in the contiguous U.S. resulting from wildland fire. The benefit of the greenhouse gas mitigation policy is equal to the difference in fuels management costs between the reference and policy scenarios. Results suggest present value ecosystem service benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation on the average of $3.5 billion (2005 dollars, assuming a three percent discount rate). Our analysis highlights the importance of considering loss of ecosystem services when evaluating the impacts of alternative greenhouse gas mitigation policies.

Analyzing data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network between 1990 and 2010, we show that over 17 million kg of fish and shellfish were kept for personal use. We used general additive models to examine patterns in proportion of personal use versus price for the top 10 species retained over the 20-year period for each of the three population groups: Washington commercial tribal (indigenous) fishing operators, Washington commercial nontribal operators, and California commercial fishing operators. Out of the 26 species-price relationships tested, only one fits the market relationship with statistical significance and the model failed to predict personal use patterns for any of the other species. We conclude that market sensitivity is not a reliable predictor for subsistence behavior. Although a nominal figure in the overall seafood catch, the presence of subsistence practices among 21st century market-based commercial fishing operators reveals a more diverse array of economic systems than previously imagined. We suggest that alternative economies, including subsistence and associated community share systems, function to improve human wellbeing and strengthen community resilience by increasing food security and community food systems, engaging in a quality of life practice, and supporting social networks through seafood gifting and sharing.

This is because previously stored forest carbon is released to the atmosphere as CO2. The debt is eventually repaid provided that the life cycle CO2 emissions of the biofuel are lower than the conventional fuel that is displaced. Managed forests are an alternative to old-growth forests with the potential to reduce the carbon debt associated with woody biomass-derived fuels. This work is the first to quantify the carbon debt incurred by transportation biofiiels derived from woody biomass from managed forests. The breakeven time of this carbon debt is computed along with breakeven times for radiative forcing, temperature change, and economic damages. In the case of biofuel production for 30 years, we find that breakeven times for carbon, radiative forcing, and temperature change are 59, 42, and 48 years, respectively. If cumulative economic damages are computed for discount rates of 1-2%, the breakeven time is greater than 100 years, while damages never break even at discount rates above 2%. Breakeven times decrease if the prevailing harvest cycle is left unchanged, but increase if biofuel production is sustained indefinitely. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically we study the role of user communication in relation to learning through continual experimentation when managing a complex resource system involving resource interdependencies. For this purpose we designed a laboratory experiment where we tested the effect of user communication over time in a setup with two interdependent resources, and where resource access is asymmetrical: one resource is shared and the other is private. Our results indicate that communication, through its interaction with experimental learning is more multifaceted than what previous experimental studies on commons dilemmas suggest. We show for example that in communicating groups the likelihood of successful resource management increases, but this effect is mostly dominant in earlier periods, when resource dynamics are unknown. We hypothesize however, that communication stimulates continual improvements by fine-tuning of management through experimental learning and coordinated resource extraction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that in communicating groups, the need to quickly gain a basic understanding of the dynamics overshadows not only the devotion to improve management of the private resource but also the potential tensions brought by the asymmetry in resource access.

First, we construct a violent crime index taking into account seven different types of crimes. We use an aggregator function to define a crime index that attaches crime-specific weights which can be interpreted as severity of each crime. These weights are estimated econometrically along with other parameters in the model thereby avoiding the problems associated with equally or arbitrary weighted aggregate crime index. Second, we utilize the aggregate crime index function to determine the impact of socio-economic variables on the overall (aggregated) crime, and further decompose them into crime-specific components. Third, in specifying the crime index we allow the possibility that crimes may be underreported and estimate crime underreporting using the stochastic frontier modeling approach. We use district level data from India for the census years 1981, 1991 and 2001. Our results fail to support the equally weighted crime index model and provide evidence of substantial underreporting.","[Chaudhuri, Kausik] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Chowdhury, Payel] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",University of Leeds; University of California System; University of California Irvine; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",kkar@binghamton.edu,,"Chaudhuri, Kausik/0000-0002-7492-1369",,,,,48,12,15,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate factors affecting the knowledge of Italian wines in foreign consumers, i.e., to what extend wine promotion actions can improve the consumer's awareness or the reputation of Italian wines. As a consequence, these activities may increase the wine consumption as well as wine exports in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach - Data have been collected through survey questionnaires where information about wine tasting, sensory satisfaction and preferences about Italian wines have been collected. The sample survey collects preferences of wine market operators in both EU and third countries. The survey, carried out from 2009 to 2011, includes 3,579 interviews classified according to four promotion actions: press conference, wine tasting, tasting course, knowledge of Italian wines. Data have been analyzed through a nonparametric combination (NPC) of dependent permutation tests to evaluate differences between and within country groups and to assess the consumer perception about Italian wines through the Keller's model. Findings - So far, Italian wine promotion activities, supported by EU wine policy, are fragmented among in many small and sometimes low effective actions. Research results may be helpful in designing more effective promotional strategies on third countries. In particular, promotional activities which should be focussed on consumer's appreciation of Italian wines as a brand instead of promoting specific wines or wineries. Research limitations/implications - The NPC method is a nonparametric tool which does not measure the structure of consumer's preferences, i.e, it does give any measure of relationships among consumer's utility and factors affecting it as it happens when a modeling approach is applied. Practical implications - Targeted promotion and information actions strongly focussed internal and external wine attributes can increase the level of knowledge in foreign consumers. It can make more efficient the marketing activity oriented to the export market. Originality/value - The NPC method offers an innovative, flexible and well-tested approach for the analysis of multivariate hypothesis when we are dealing with complex problems in wine market.","[Barisan, Luigino; Boatto, Vasco] Univ Padua, Res Ctr Viticulture & Enol, Conegliano, Italy; [Rossetto, Luca] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy; [Salmaso, Luigi] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua,"Boatto, V (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Res Ctr Viticulture & Enol, Conegliano, Italy.",vasco.boatto@unipd.it,"Barisan, Luigino/E-5948-2013","Barisan, Luigino/0000-0002-5000-3168",,,,,54,8,8,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Specifics of bank marketing over traditional marketing approach that we encounter in companies. What are all the specifics school marketing in the banking industry in the world today with us. In particular, we try to explain all the specifics of marketing communications that are increasingly gaining in importance in communicating with clients both between banks and companies, and between banks and individuals (clients). How much is a marketing communication today important for modern banking management and how her character is given at the present time. Bank marketing can be defined as the set of all the bank's activities directed towards the study of financial markets with the aim of meeting the needs of existing and potential customers and achieve business goals with the other hand. In addition to the commercial orientation of banks in meeting the needs of clients, marketing involves the use of many istrumenata in achieving business policy (marketing mix), and systematic treatment of the business policy (control marketing). Following all these factors that lead to that if the bank wants to maintain its market position, profitability, the clients can wait for the client to come to the bank, we come to their clients should go to meet. Banks that want to succeed must accept the marketing concept and the absolute orientation of the consumers. The main objective of each bank should be satisfied customer. One satisfied customer will always remain a consumer. One unhappy customer brings along at least five of them. Banks that have until recently had a distinctly authoritarian attitude towards their customers must reorient in kind bidders. All the more reason for this is the fact that in developed countries, there is a very large number of financial institutions that offer similar services, but often offer exceeds demand. Notwith standing this statement today, however there are a number of banks that hard to accept marketing concept. In countries in transition usually first develops the banking sector, and this is something that happened to us banking business. Thanks to the media, marketing and PR campaigns to inform citizens on a daily basis about the new banks and the various services offered by the banks. Of great importance is the adequate representation of the public banks, which must be done in the best possible way when it starts operating in foreign markets.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the evolution of the food patterns of generation X in the past decade, in view of formulating a reflection on the trends of a fundamental component of society. Design/methodology/approach - Applying latent class clustering to the food spending of a representative sample of Italian consumers has made it possible to identify the principal food patterns and to interpret them in light of demographic characteristics and sociocultural changes. Findings - The results show a strengthening of dietary lifestyles displaying a high content of animal proteins, especially in consumers with low levels of education. The importance of convenience foods emerges, mainly among couples but also among families with children. The role of out of the home consumptions grows, mostly among single males. Parallel to this critical picture, the authors note the birth of a new dietary sensitivity that leads a niche of consumers to choose healthier foods. These evolutions offer new challenges and new opportunities for both public and private operators. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the analysis of family food spending. A challenging development of the study unfolds in closely examining the food choices of individuals, particularly for the consumption patterns at greater risk. Extending the study to other countries would permit a comparison between diet, lifestyles and food education policies on a supernational level. Originality/value - The study indicates several possible strategies both for operators of the food sector to better respond to the demand, and for public institutions in view of contributing to correct current trends, reorienting food habits towards healthier patterns and, in any event, patterns compatible with the demands tied to the new lifestyles.","[Casini, Leonardo; Contini, Caterina; Romano, Caterina; Scozzafava, Gabriele] Univ Florence, Dept Management & Agr Syst, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Contini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Management & Agr Syst, Florence, Italy.",caterina.contini@unifi.it,"CONTINI, CATERINA/IUO-1064-2023","CONTINI, CATERINA/0000-0003-0626-574X; Scozzafava, Gabriele/0000-0002-2381-9938; CASINI, LEONARDO/0000-0001-8965-4390",,,,,34,34,37,4,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Data from the Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (n = 39,506) on nutrition label use was analysed. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with reading nutrition labels, adjusted for confounders. Findings - The findings show that females, young adults aged between 18 and 30 years, Malays, tertiary educated, singles, employed individuals, physically active adults and non-smokers were significantly associated with increased odds of nutrition label use. Research limitations/implications - Causality could not be established due to the cross-sectional study design. The scope of the data collected limited investigations to the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with nutrition label use. Future research measuring consumers' attention, motivation and comprehension of nutrition label use and subsequent food selection should be conducted. Practical implications - Health promotion efforts targeted towards promoting the use of nutrition label among males, older adults aged between 31 and 40 years, ethnic minorities, primary educated, widowed/divorced individuals, unemployed, physically inactive and smokers are recommended. Originality/value - This nationwide study provides valuable insights into the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors significantly associated with nutrition label use among Malaysian adults.","[Cheah, Yong Kang] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok, Malaysia; [Moy, Foong Ming; Loh, Debbie Ann] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Julius Ctr, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Cheah, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok, Malaysia.",cheahykang@gmail.com,"Moy, Foong Ming/B-7899-2010; Cheah, Yong Kang/M-2677-2014","Moy, Foong Ming/0000-0002-0306-4419; Cheah, Yong Kang/0000-0002-6793-7055; Loh, Debbie Ann/0000-0001-9031-0448","University of Malaya/Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia under High Impact Research Grant [H-20001-00-E2000069]","University of Malaya/Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia under High Impact Research Grant","The authors would like to thank the Director General of Health, Malaysia for granting permission to use the data from the Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS III) and to publish this manuscript.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Three extensions are proposed and argued to be particularly useful for analyzing economic organization in conditions such as those prevailing in agri-food industries. First, more consideration is given to horizontal structures and associational contracts as a particularly important response to transactional problems in this field. Second, it is acknowledged that different conditions of substitutability in different stages of the chain make it likely that transaction costs are different for different parties, bringing them to have different preferences over governance solutions, whereby a negotiation problem on efficient arrangements has to be solved. Third, the very process of integrating different parties' interests contributes in explaining the emergence of hybrids and in designing more efficient and more fair forms within the (very) large class of hybrids, and even within any sub-type of hybrid, such as sub-contracting, licensing, franchising, consortia, etc. Findings - New Pareto-improving and Nash-improving solutions are specified, and shown to provide indications for organizational change that differ from those predicted and prescribed by standard organizational economics. Those solutions are also shown to be realistic (possible in reality) through case studies on actual non-main-stream experiences approximating those arrangements. Both the analytic method proposed, and the solutions found, provide useful and currently missing tools to private and public policy makers for improving the organization of the sector. Research limitations/implications - The study specify pre-conditions for reaching superior agreements, that suggest hypotheses for empirical further research on the factors that may favor or hinder those changes. Practical implications - A trend for change is recommended for the agri-food sector, toward more associational and horizontal arrangements, rather than either toward market or hierarchical governance or any hybrid intermediate point between them. It has been shown that this prescription should hold not only across stages of the value chain, but also among firms within the same stage (in the case, the farming stage). Social implications - The proposed changes should improve the fairness of economic organization in the sector. Re-equilibrating negotiation power is an alternative way of reducing transaction costs across stages and a pre-condition for reaching more efficient and fair agreements across stages. Originality/value - Both the analytic method proposed, and the solutions found, extend economic organization theory, and provide useful and currently missing tools to private and public policy makers for designing and assessing the organization of the sector.","[Grandori, Anna] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Ctr Res Org & Management, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Grandori, A (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Ctr Res Org & Management, Milan, Italy.",anna.grandori@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,43,17,17,3,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Data obtained from an online survey of 565 members belonging to a New York state CSA were analyzed using a combined hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis. Findings - Based on their motivations to join a CSA results reveal four distinct types of segments among CSA members: No-Frills Member, Foodie Member, Nonchalant Member, and Quintessential Member. Results show all four clusters differ statistically across demographic characteristics including gender, political affiliation, and household income. The clusters differed across psychographic characteristics such as attitudes toward the treatment of animals, treatment of farm workers, pesticide use, the environment, food miles, and limiting factory farm purchases. Quintessential Members emerge as most concerned with food purchasing decisions while No-Frills Members are least concerned. Research limitations/implications - The study employs a non-random purposive sample of CSAs in New York state. Respondents were recruited indirectly to participate in an online survey. The length and complexity of the survey, absence of an email address for respondents, levels of digital fluency, and technical glitches may result in lower participation rates. Practical implications - This paper offers recommendations to farmers for retaining and attracting different types of CSA members. Originality/value - This is the first study that segments CSA members in the USA based on their motivations to subscribe to a CSA, and it differentiates CSA member clusters based on their demographics, psychographics, and food purchasing decisions.","[Pole, Antoinette] Montclair State Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Law, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Kumar, Archana] Montclair State Univ, Dept Mkt, Montclair, NJ USA",Montclair State University; Montclair State University,"Pole, A (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Law, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",tonipole@gmail.com,"Pole, Antoinette/AAE-6295-2020",,,,,,54,26,27,3,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Since consumer socialization has long been considered but it is important to understand whether the extent of consumer socialization in terms of soft drink consumption influences consumer behavior by taking into consideration consumer cohorts. Design/methodology/approach - The quantitative research is based on consumer survey method by using Likert scale questionnaire. Convenience sampling technique with a sample size of 637 is used. Data are analyzed by using cronbach a, ANOVA, correlation and multiple regressions. Findings - Overall, the findings maintain the impact of consumer socialization on soft drink consumption. Such influence of consumer socialization through social media, cultural groups and social groups encourages soft drink socialization behavior. Additionally there is also an evidence of mediating role of consumer generational behavior in soft drink consumption. Research limitations/implications - The results of this paper extend knowledge of how consumer socialization affects soft drink consumption behavior and provide important insights into how consumer cohorts should be targeted. The Chosen research approach is a limitation of the study. Practical implications - The results are of value to academic researchers, soft drink industry practitioners in a way that it will help them to portray marketing and advertising activities by taking into consideration consumer cohorts behavior.

Although income per capita was increasing, other indicators, such as mortality rates or heights, portrayed a completely different image. This paper adds to the standard of living debate by analysing the potential effect of the privatisation of common lands. Although highly controversial regarding its impact on the modernisation process itself, its contribution to human welfare has somewhat received much less attention. Focusing on the Spanish experience, this paper exploits geographical variation over time by collecting a panel data set at the provincial level on three different periods: 1860, 1900 and 1930. The empirical analysis shows that the persistence of these collective resources is related with higher life expectancy and heights, particularly during the second half of the nineteenth century. Biological human welfare also seems to have been negatively influenced by the progressively decreasing role that local communities played on the management of these resources. The survival of common lands in some regions provided peasants with mechanisms different from the market, thus making the transition to a market economy more socially sustainable.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"Tapia, FJB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",francisco.beltran@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Beltran Tapia, Francisco/H-4337-2015","Beltran Tapia, Francisco/0000-0002-7354-5699",,,,,90,12,12,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2015,9.0,1,,,,,27.0,48.0,,10.1007/s11698-014-0107-9,0.0,,,22,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AX8GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347147700002,0

However, to date the policy debate is been based on ad hoc claims, while there is relatively little micro-level evidence. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the determinants of structural change in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the determinants of structural change in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009, using a unique panel survey of 296 farm households in the North and South Central Region of Bulgaria. In order to control for sample attrition bias, the authors use a two-step Heckman model of farm survival and growth model. Findings - The data confirms the rapid outflow of agricultural labour from dairy farming activities: 55 per cent of the farm households supplying milk to a dairy company in 2003 stopped supplying in 2009. The main reasons for quitting are ageing of the household, health problems and an increase in off-farm employment alternatives and not supply chain modernisation and milk quality standards. The institutional innovations which are associated with integration in modern supply chains, such as the provision of farm assistance programmes, have a positive impact on small farms' growth. Originality/value - The study is one of the first to use panel data to analyse the impact of standards on the survival and growth of small farms in value chains. The authors analyse the determinants of farm survival and growth in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009, using panel surveys of 296 dairy farm households in the North and South Central Region of Bulgaria and panel data from interviews with dairy companies. The findings are relevant beyond the Bulgarian dairy sector as supply chain modernisation and changes in quality regulations are taken place in many other transition and developing countries.","[Van Herck, Kristine; Swinnen, Johan] KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van Herck, K (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.",kristine.vanherck@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",KULeuven Research Fund (Methusalem),KULeuven Research Fund (Methusalem),The authors of the paper thank the anonymous reviewers and (guest) editors for comments and suggested improvements to the paper.

What were the three main forms of credit offered by Londonersunsecured cash loans, sales of goods on credit, and written instruments called bonds (section II)? What is yielded by decadal analysis of Londoners' extension of credit in the fifteenth centurymaking direct comparisons with Nightingale's published Statute Merchant and Staple data (section III)? What defines, in modern economic terms, the claim of so-called monetarist' historians that credit was actively withdrawn during the depression, and how is this verified by the actions of London creditors (section IV)? It is concluded that the records of the Court of Common Pleas provide the detailed evidence monetarist historians have previously lacked both to prove that Londoners actively withdrew credit during the fifteenth century and to demonstrate that they employed pure equilibrium credit rationing in order to do so.","[Stevens, Matthew Frank] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Stevens, MF (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",,,"Stevens, Matthew Frank/0000-0001-8646-951X",,,,,51,4,6,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The externality market is modelled with a limited number of pollution permits that are traded between representative firms in different sectors. The model is applied to identify the gains of a common nitrogen regulation system for Danish agriculture crop and aquaculture production. Common regulation across the two sectors is found to increase GDP by euro 32 million, corresponding to 22% of their initial GDP contribution. The direct effect in the two sectors is euro 39 million, where the spill-over effect is 7 million. Full use of recirculation technology in aquaculture entails a further increase in GDP to 106 million. The introduction of a common regulatory system and recirculation technology, simultaneous with a reduction of the common nitrogen cap of 17.6%, corresponding to the current policy objectives, is found to increase GDP by 52 million, 4.1% of their initial contribution. Hence, introducing a common regulatory system and taking advantage of the new technology more than counterbalances the negative socio-economic effect of a cap reduction. The analysis points to the importance of introducing more coherent regulatory frameworks that include all polluters under the same regulatory system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study looks to answer two questions: (1) Is the capital adequacy ratio of 8 % required by Basel II too low to guide banks moving toward the efficiency frontier? (2) Is Basel III's target capital adequacy ratio of 10.5 % in 2019 so strict that it might impact banks' efficiency? The dataset herein consists of thirty-one Taiwan commercial banks over the period 2007-2009 for a total of ninety-three observations. The empirical results indicate that as many as 93.5 % of the banks have an optimal capital adequacy ratio greater than the 8 % regulation in Basel II. Approximately 88.2 % of the banks have an optimal capital adequacy ratio higher than 10.5 %. In addition, nearly 73 % of the banks should raise their BIS ratios in order to achieve the optimal BIS ratios. Hence, higher BIS ratios required by Basel III may pilot the Taiwan banking industry to reach the efficiency frontier.","[Li, Yang] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Business & Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Yi-Kai] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chien, Feng Sheng] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Lee, Wen Chih] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Coll Management, Grad Inst Commerce, Kaohsiung 80778, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yi Ching] Ta Chong Bank, Commercial Banking Div 1, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National University Kaohsiung; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Chien, FS (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",julian@hp-oa.com,"Chien, Fengsheng/AFU-3695-2022; Chien, Fengsheng/AAW-1016-2020","Chien, Fengsheng/0000-0002-1394-4161; Chien, Fengsheng/0000-0002-1394-4161",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-390-028-],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors would like to thank the associate editor and the two anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions and comments that led to significant improvement of the paper.

Critics have argued that GDP per capita fails to capture adequately the multi-dimensional nature of welfare, and have developed alternative measures such as the human development index. Whilst recognising that these wider indicators provide an appropriate way of assessing levels of welfare, we argue that GDP per capita remains a more appropriate measure for assessing development potential, focussing on production possibilities and the sustainability of consumption.

Middle-class women were extensively engaged in entrepreneurship and innovation, and the empirical analysis indicates that their commercial efforts were significantly enhanced by association with family firms.

Potent participation and compliance enforcement will be required to make it in every key emitter's best interest to participate in, and comply with, an agreement which specifies deep emissions reductions for all its signatories. This article considers the conditions under which potent enforcement would likely be politically feasible. Based on assessments of the current political landscape, and on the sets of constraints that characterize negotiations over enforcement systems, the article firstly finds that neither type of enforcement would be politically feasible if agreement is sought among all key emitters. Secondly, because participation enforcement is perceived as less legitimate than compliance enforcement, the coalition of countries prepared to accept the former is likely smaller than the coalition prepared to accept the latter. Thirdly, participation enforcement likely places stricter requirements on the coalition's membership and size. Thus, while compliance enforcement should in principle always be politically feasible among some coalition, reaching agreement on participation enforcement is less likely. To the extent that participation enforcement is politically feasible, however, an agreement which enforces the cooperation of all key emitters may be attainable.","[Aakre, Stine] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",,"Aakre, S (通讯作者)，CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",stine.aakre@cicero.oslo.no,,"Aakre, Stine/0000-0003-4269-2650",Research Council of Norway [185508],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The author would like to thank Jon Hovi, the editor of International Environmental Agreements, and the anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments.

This interplay might induce influence, affecting institutions' development and performance. The following research adds to this debate by systematically analyzing the quantitative evidence on how institutional interaction drives institutional design from a network perspective. Using dyadic cross-sectional data on international environmental agreements in 1952-2000, the authors find support for their theoretical argument that regimes' similarity in design as captured by their degree of legalization strongly depends on institutions' interaction. However, while soft law'' disseminates between regimes that are well connected through direct or indirect links, this does not apply to hard law.'' The authors explain this divergence with states' concerns about binding-law commitments and sovereignty costs associated with the latter.

The paper seeks to find out how can collaboration in agri-food supply chain lead to low wastage and better efficiency. Also, the paper attempts to capture the nuances of collaborative practices and perceptions of buyers and suppliers toward collaboration. Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology in a top Indian food processing firm was conducted to explore the application and benefits of collaboration in supply chains, In-depth interviews with upstream supply chain members were conducted to understand the process of supply chain collaboration. Grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the transcripts. Findings - First, through content analysis of interview transcripts a comprehensive framework and a generic model was derived to understand the process of supply chain collaboration. Supplier selection, joint planning and information sharing were found to be main antecedents while profits; waste reduction and supply chain efficiency were major outcomes of collaboration. Second, it was found that the suppliers are usually more skeptical of the buyers and do not trust them easily. While, for buyers, it is very important to have good relations with suppliers and should make provide incentives to suppliers for collaboration. Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study to elaborate the process and outcomes of collaborative activities along an Indian agri-food supply chain through in-depth qualitative study, In developing countries, agriculture industry is the backbone of economy, Therefore, the insights developed in this study may be useful for managers in agribusiness to dwell into such supply chain practices that would increase profit and efficiency, and decrease wastage.","[Aggarwal, Shikha] Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon, India; [Srivastava, Manoj Kumar] Management Dev Inst, Operat Management, Gurgaon, India",Management Development Institute (MDI); Management Development Institute (MDI),"Aggarwal, S (通讯作者)，Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon, India.",fpm13shikha_a@mdi.ac.in,"Srivastava, Manoj K/K-5433-2016; Srivastava, Manoj/AAG-6020-2020","Srivastava, Manoj K/0000-0002-8701-4522;",,,,,90,40,44,1,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate if management aspects and marketing innovation propensity could have an important role in choosing direct sale tool. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative analysis in Apulia region (Italy) was carried out. Data have been collected through a face to face and web-based exploratory survey submitted to a sample of 280 cellars participating in an Integrated Projects of Food Chains. A logit regression model was run in the research design. Findings - Findings showed that most of interviewed wineries, mainly characterized by agricultural production and direct approach to customers, are more likely inclined to direct sales choice. Research limitations/implications - The sample size could be expanded (e.g. to include farms from other regions or not belonging to an integrated projects). Practical implications - Managerial implications give insight on the role of direct sales as an opportunity to obtain aggregated value for agri-products and to increase bargaining power of farmers. Social implications - Food direct sales could have the important task of straightening the social proximity between rural and urban stakeholders, increasing trust and connection between producers and consumers. Originality/value - This paper can shed some light on this topic, since direct food sales across regions is less investigated than direct marketing.","[Fiore, Mariantonietta] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Fiore, M (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Foggia, Italy.",mariantonietta.fiore@unifg.it,"fiore, mariantonietta/L-3559-2019","fiore, mariantonietta/0000-0002-9244-6776",,,,,64,19,19,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Specifically, the authors examine how trade liberalisation has affected the mussel farming industry. Design/methodology/approach - The authors aim to observe the general panorama of both the evolution of production, distinguishing between fresh and industrial usage, and the evolution of prices at source depending on destination (fresh or industrial in the period 2003-2012). In order to analyse the relationships between different agents of the value chain, Porter's model has been used as a reference. Findings - There is a loss of competitiveness in the mussel farming-production sector following the liberalisation agreement of 2006 and huge bargaining power of the processing sector vs the production sector. Practical implications - There is an opportunity to implement traceability programmes and<^> develop a more differentiated product. In addition, it is profitable to promote Galician mussels through generic advertising and promoting exports. Originality/value - There is a lack of empirical studies about the impact that the new free trade agreement between the EU and Chile has had on the Spanish mussel industry. Particularly, the study analyses economic repercussions, managerial implications and new challenges stemming from the new context of trade liberalisation.","[Gonzalez Laxe, Fernando] Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ, La Coruna, Spain; [Martin Palmero, Federico; Calvo Dopico, Domingo] Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; Universidade da Coruna,"Dopico, DC (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain.",domingo.calvo.dopico@udc.es,,"Martin Palmero, Federico/0000-0003-3790-5789; Gonzalez-Laxe, Fernando/0000-0001-5399-3446","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, within the National Program for Research, Development and Innovation [DER 2013-45923R]","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, within the National Program for Research, Development and Innovation","This research has been developed under the framework of the research project entitled Reform of the international fisheries governance (DER 2013-45923R), funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, within the National Program for Research, Development and Innovation focused on the challeges of the society.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify important organic product characteristics, this study applies a Generalized Linear Model using a six-year sample of Swiss household data distinguishing between organic and conventional products at the product level. Findings - The analysis reveals three product-related dimensions of importance. First, Swiss consumers prefer unprocessed organic products over highly processed ones suggesting that communicating potential benefits of organic food is more promising for unprocessed products. Second, organic consumers are reluctant to buy products with high price premiums. Third, Swiss consumers prefer domestically produced organic products over imported ones. Practical implications - The results imply that supporting organic agriculture in Switzerland is still promising from a policy and a marketing perspective as long as the organic price premium is not too high. Originality/value - This paper presents results regarding the determinants of the organic market share in Switzerland. They give a first understanding of which product characteristics determine organic market shares. From a policy as well as from a marketing perspective a further investigation at the household level is promising in order to understand and respond to the needs and expectations of Swiss consumers.","[Gotze, Franziska; Mann, Stefan; Ferjani, Ali; Kohler, Andreas] Agroscope, Inst Sustainabil Sci ISS, Res Grp Socioecon, Ettenhausen Tg, Switzerland; [Gotze, Franziska; Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Econ & Agr Policy, Bonn, Germany",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bonn,"Götze, F (通讯作者)，Agroscope, Inst Sustainabil Sci ISS, Res Grp Socioecon, Ettenhausen Tg, Switzerland.;Götze, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Econ & Agr Policy, Bonn, Germany.",franziska.goetze@agroscope.admin.ch,"Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011","Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480; Kohler, Andreas/0000-0003-2756-8512; Gotze, Franziska/0000-0001-9022-0880",,,,,41,16,16,2,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically show whether and to what extent financial, functional, individual and social dimensions as well as sustainability and authenticity contribute to consumers' perception of the luxury value of food. Design/methodology/approach - The effects of seven exploratory value dimensions on a perceived luxury value for foods were measured using a partial least squares structural equation analysis of a database generated by a survey done on 936 German consumers in summer 2014. Findings - Luxury food was found to serve as a suitable setting to investigate both old and new motives for luxury consumption. The analyses revealed that all factors contribute significantly to luxury value, with functional and individual luxury facets having the strongest effects. Practical and methodological implications can be derived from the results. Research limitations/implications - Limitations are due to the applied methodology. Practical implications - The definitional dimensions of a luxury food value correspond to those for a general luxury good. The significance of two new luxury values, sustainability and authenticity, was confirmed for luxury food. The functional and individual luxury values were found to be the most significant. This supports the previously postulated change in motives for luxury consumption and also mirrors the new emphasis on quality and self-identity in the German food sector. These findings can be utilised in practical food marketing. Originality/value - Although there are major similarities between food and luxury good consumption patterns, how luxury can be defined in the context of food had not been previously investigated empirically. This paper is the first to study the factors that contribute to the luxury value of food.","[Hartmann, Laura Helena; Nitzko, Sina; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Hartmann, LH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",lhartma@gwdg.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,111,14,15,2,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Research was conducted on a sample of 107 agricultural enterprises from the three Northwestern Croatian counties; Koprivnica-Krizevci, Bjelovar-Bilogora and Zagreb County. The main aim of the study in this paper was to determine how agricultural enterprises can affect their marketing efficiency by developing sustainability-oriented innovation. Empirical research was conducted through a survey and for this purpose a questionnaire was used as a major research tool. SPSS 22 software package was used for statistical analysis of the colleceted data. A method of descriptive statistics was used for the purpose of data analysis and their processing. Regression analysis was also made in order to establish the statistically significant influence of some independent variables on the marketing efficiency of agricultural enterprises as the dependent variable. Independent variables were Research and Development, Sustainable Product, Marketing Management, IT and Education. Statistically significant ratio of change F indicates that independent variables contribute to explaining the dependent variable. The more innovative competence is oriented towards sustainability, the better is marketing efficiency. Within the innovation competence it is clear that research and development and information and communication technologies variables contribute to the marketing efficiency. As these two competences are more pronounced, marketing efficiency is better.","[Jercinovic, Silvije; Dadacek, Nada] Krizevci Coll Agr, Krizhevci, Croatia",,"Jercinovic, S (通讯作者)，Krizevci Coll Agr, Krizhevci, Croatia.",sjercinovic@vguk.hr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,10,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,151.0,157.0,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200018,0

The results show that access to green urban areas, such as gardens and parks, is positively associated with, whereas access to abandoned areas, such as waste or leftover land, is negatively associated with life satisfaction. The effects are strongest for residents who are older, accounting for up to a third of the size of the effect of being unemployed on life satisfaction. We calculate the marginal willingness-to-pay of residents in order to have access to green urban and abandoned areas in their surroundings, as well as the life-satisfaction maximising amounts of them.

The author proposes the suitable training methods of the college students, to allow more students to participate in badminton, to improve the physical conditions with the badminton movement as the means, and especially to improve the psychological levels. The contents of the researches on the physical fitness mainly include three aspects of the morphological structures, the physiological functions and the psychological states of the human body. The university is an important period in the process of the higher education and the continuous growth of every individual. At present, the problem of the college students' physical health has been concerned by all the people. Many experts pay more attention to the psychological health as well as the physiological functions of the college students. The results of all kinds of the investigations showed that the status of the mental health of college students is not optimistic, which needs to be improved. Among many of the regulation means, the sports are the simplest and the most effective means. Badminton is a sport event of the net separated competition, and its characteristics of security, easy handling and entertainment make the students more likely to participate in it, and it is easier to control it, making it easier for the college students to experience fun of the movement, and create the opportunities for the cultivation of the future lifelong consciousness of the physical training.","[Ren, Honghua] Xijing Univ, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xijing University,"Ren, HH (通讯作者)，Xijing Univ, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,9,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,448.0,452.0,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200082,0

Design/methodology/approach - Attitude toward food waste is a paradigmatic (economic) nonstandard decision making. Based on behavioral economics concepts and empirical evidences, the study analyzes the frequency of household food waste and its main drivers with a focus on individual income. Through a panel of 1,403 Italian consumers, food waste behavior and its determinants are modeled for five food typologies using proportional odds models that adopt stepwise procedures and genetic algorithms. Findings - Results suggest the existence of complex relationships between per capita income and household food waste behavior. When considering food typologies that include high value added products, this relation can be explained by an inverse U-shaped curve: mid-to-low income consumers purchase higher amounts of lower quality products and waste more food. Research limitations/implications - The research highlights the importance of understanding the main socio-economic and behavioral determinants of household food waste, and the need for further researches. Practical implications - The research motivates specific pricing, commercial and policy strategies as well as organizational technological, and educational solutions to prevent/reduce household food waste. Social implications - Lower income class consumers show a greater attitude to waste certain food typologies. In turn, this implies that food waste can further worse economic inequality and relative poverty. Originality/value - The study identifies different patterns of relationship among individual income and consumers' food waste behavior, and describes the conditions that limit a household Food Waste Kuznets Curve.","[Setti, Marco; Falasconi, Luca; Segre, Andrea; Cusano, Ilaria; Vittuari, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Setti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy.",marco.setti@unibo.it,"falasconi, luca/AHB-0701-2022; Vittuari, Matteo/P-5274-2014","Vittuari, Matteo/0000-0003-4327-1575",,,,,49,102,111,9,69,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Therefore, it is important to be aware of the factors which affect both road freight and the amount of greenhouse gases emissions by road freight transport. One way to acquire information about the future is by using econometric models which, in addition to forecasts, illustrate interconnections between different factors. This study looks at the use of the econometric simultaneous equations model for forecasting the effect and the negative impact that road freight transport has on environment.

The research examined consumer responses to the images through the prism of the relationship between symbolism, ritual and myth, as well as other related values. Design/methodology/approach - In a series of focus groups with consumers from four anglophone countries (the USA, New Zealand, Australia and the UK), six images of champagne and sparkling wine were used as stimuli to encourage affective and cognitive perspectives on the topic. Findings - Overall, the UK market showed distinct differences from the other markets, due very much to its cultural context. The UK consumers valued traditional advertising; focused mainly on the product itself; and did not associate champagne with fun. Respondents from the New World focused on the general impression of the image and on enjoyment and fun associated with consumption of champagne and sparkling wine. Practical implications - The most crucial implication of this research is the cultural variation in consumer perceptions of champagne and sparkling wine and the impact that it has upon marketing strategies on how to market this product category to younger consumers in different markets.

Design/methodology/approach - A web-based free word association test was administered to 302 consumers in China. They were asked to give the first three words that came into their minds when they were presented with each of two stimulus words, traditional food and European food. Three researchers grouped the elicited words into classes and then into dimensions. chi(2) association tests were used to assess and identify statistically significant differences in the frequencies of classes and dimensions for the two food concepts between socio-demographic groups. Findings - The findings show that Chinese consumers define Chinese traditional food and European food through ten similar dimensions: Sensory appeal, Health, Origin, Marketing, Safety, Variety, Heritage, Symbolic meaning, Simplicity and Mood. Additionally, they associate Chinese traditional food with the dimensions Elaboration, Celebration and Habit, as well as link European food to the dimensions Convenience and New. Although ten dimensions are the same, obvious differences can be identified by comparing the classes for the two food concepts. Further, there are significant differences in the class associations for European food between age groups and in the dimension associations for Chinese traditional food between gender groups. Originality/value - By using an online qualitative research method, this study is one of the first to address how Chinese consumers define both European food and their own traditional food in China, the largest East Asian country. The findings are particularly useful for the future development of traditional food products and for the future export of European food products onto China and even other countries in East Asia.","[Wang, Ou; Gellynck, Xavier; Verbeke, Wim] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Wang, Ou] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Business & Social Sci, Truro, NS, Canada",Ghent University; Dalhousie University,"Verbeke, W (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.",wim.verbeke@ugent.be,"Wang, Ou/H-6346-2014; GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Wang, Ou/0000-0002-7976-3232; Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",,,,,70,25,28,3,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A Southern European case study assesses farmers' long and short-run adaptation responses under climate change and policy interventions with a discrete stochastic programming model. Results indicate that climate change will likely have negative impacts on irrigation activities and water-dependent ecosystems in Southern Europe. However, the severity of impacts depends on government policy settings and farmers' adaptation responses. The comparison between water market and irrigation subsidy policies shows the advantages of water markets over irrigation subsidies in terms of both private and social benefits. These findings could guide policymakers on the design of efficient water institutions and policies to address climate change in the irrigated agriculture of Southern Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve two fundamental policy goals-equity in health care utilization and control of health care costs-policymakers need a better understanding of the underlying determinants of individual health care expenditure beyond the results of mean regressions. In this paper, we apply a quantile regression method to investigate the heterogeneous effects of various determinants of medical expenditure in China. Comparing with the average effects, we find that health care expenditures at the upper end of the distribution are under stronger influences of need factors such as poor health status, and weaker influences of socioeconomic factors and insurance status. On the other hand, health care expenditures at the lower end of the distribution are under stronger influences of socioeconomic factors and insurance status, and weaker influences of need factors. Our study may provide useful information to policymakers for the optimal design of their health care systems, and it may be of particular interests to the health policymakers in China, where is currently still in a period of reshaping its health-care system.","[Zhao, Jianmei; Zhong, Hai] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhao, JM (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",jianmei@cufe.edu.cn; haizhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund from Chinese Ministry of Education [10YJC790393],Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund from Chinese Ministry of Education,"This research is sponsored by Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund, No: 10YJC790393 from Chinese Ministry of Education.",,37,6,7,4,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

This paper clarifies the links between the two underlying motives: the first, technical in nature, is the necessity to redirect the infrastructure instruments in these countries (energy, transportation, building, material transformation industry) to avoid lock-in in carbon-intensive pathways in the likely absence of a significant world carbon price in the coming decade; the second, political in nature, is the interpretation of the CGF as a practical translation of the notion of the common but differentiated responsibility principle, since the funds are expected to come from Annex 1 countries. This paper shows why this latter perspective might generate some distrust given the orders of magnitude of funds to be levied in Annex 1 countries especially in the context of the financial crisis and major constraints on public budgets. It then explores the basic principles around which it is possible to minimize these risks by upgrading climate finance in the broader context of the evolution of the financial and monetary systems. After exploring how such links could help make climate policies that contribute to reducing some of the imbalances caused by economic globalization by reorienting world savings and reducing investment uncertainty, it sketches how this perspective might be palatable for the OECD, the major emerging economies and fossil fuel exporters.","[Aglietta, Michel] Ctr Rech Francais Domaine Econ Int CEPII, F-75007 Paris, France; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles] Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Fabert, Baptiste Perrissin] CNRS, Delegat Paris Michel Ange, F-75794 Paris 16, France; [Jaeger, Carlo] Global Climate Forum, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Hourcade, JC (通讯作者)，Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",hourcade@centre-cired.fr,,,,,,,32,17,17,5,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Three regulation strategies are proposed for the case of groundwater allocations for irrigation: the first relies on economic instruments; the second is based on tools designed to promote pro-social behaviors; and the third combines assumptions from the first two approaches. They are evaluated through 16 scenario workshops involving 124 stakeholders and farmers in five French groundwater basins. Stakeholders' perceptions are analyzed, disentangling the ethical, economic, institutional, social and technical perspectives underlying the stakeholders' arguments for or against the proposed instruments for groundwater-use regulation. The analysis reveals a preference for the strategy that combines economic and social incentives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After a qualitative discussion of this literature, we empirically assess it by exploiting meta-regression-analysis techniques to test the effectiveness of two determinants: policy and R&D. Our findings are clear: as for the first, we show that only certain types of policy have proven to affect El, in particular regulatory stringency.

The article specifically examines the process involved in the development of collective agency and collective capabilities and identifies the tensions between the individual and collective levels.

However, there is no clear understanding of the conditions under which water, climate change, and migration are conceived of as security concerns or of their policy implications. This article explores the different means through which Israel, Jordan, and Syria have framed issues of water, climate change, and migration as national security concerns. Based upon an analysis of governmental and publicly available documents, coupled with field interviews with Israeli and Jordanian policymakers, experts, and nongovernmental organizations, we identify two different framings of the water-climate-migration nexus, depending on whether migration is largely external or internal. In Israel and Jordan, concern with influxes of external migrants elevated migration as a security issue in part through impacts on already-scarce water resources. In Syria, where severe drought in the early 2000s prompted large-scale internal migration, officials downplayed connections between scarce water resources, drought, and internal migration, part of a broader pattern of rural neglect. Unlike much of the conventional literature that has posited a linear relationship between climate change, decreasing water availability, and migration, we provide a more robust picture of the water-climate-migration nexus that shows how securitized framings take different forms and produce several unintended consequences.","[Weinthal, Erika] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zawahri, Neda] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Sowers, Jeannie] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Duke University; University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Weinthal, E (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, POB 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",erika.weinthal@duke.edu,,"Sowers, Jeannie/0000-0002-0940-375X",,,,,77,41,44,2,119,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper presents a framework for adjusting optimal water protection in the long term when the true trend in nutrient loading is unknown to the decision maker but can be gradually learned by monitoring stochastic nutrient loads. The economic impacts of an unknown trend consist of (i) the damage caused by the worsened state of the sea, (ii) the cost of nutrient abatement to counter the development and (iii) the adjustment costs caused by uncertainty and imperfect learning. An integrated assessment model is designed and calibrated for quantitative results pertaining to the uncertain impacts of climate change on nutrient input to the Baltic Sea. Under certainty, the net economic impacts from the currently anticipated climate change are 15.0 billion euros, of which 23% comes from welfare losses caused by aggravated eutrophication and 77% from increased abatement costs. The expected adjustment costs due to uncertain future development range from 90 million euros in the case of adaptive management based on Bayesian learning to as much as 7960 million euros in the case of an extreme variant of inadaptive management based on constant abatement levels. If adaptive management is adopted, there is no need to account for future climate change when planning the current abatement targets. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Bequest values linked to natural ecosystems can be particularly significant for indigenous communities whose livelihoods and cultures are tied to ecosystems. Here we apply a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to determine indigenous fishers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for bequest gains from management actions in a locally managed marine area in Madagascar, and use our results to estimate an implicit discount rate. We validate our results using a unique rating and ranking game and other mixed methods. We find that bequest is highly valued and important; respondents were willing to pay a substantial portion of their income to protect ecosystems for future generations. Through all of our inquiries, bequest emerged as the highest priority, even when respondents were forced to make trade-offs among other livelihood-supporting ecosystem services. This study is among a relative few to quantify bequest values and apply a DCE to model trade-offs, value ecosystem service flows, and estimate discount rates in a developing country. Our results directly inform coastal management in Madagascar and elsewhere by providing information on the socio-cultural value of bequest in comparison to other ecosystem service benefits.

Based on this overview, we advocate taking the SLX model as point of departure in case a well-founded theory indicating which model is most appropriate is lacking. In contrast to other spatial econometric models, the SLX model also allows for the spatial weights matrix W to be parameterized and the application of standard econometric techniques to test for endogenous explanatory variables. This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2).

Even though it is not one physical entity, it influences human well-being in multiple ways, mostly indirectly. While considerable research effort has been spent on the economic valuation of biodiversity, it remains to be a particularly challenging 'valuation object'. Valuation practitioners therefore have to use proxies for biodiversity, many of which are very simple (single species, habitats). This paper presents a comprehensive and critical review of biodiversity valuation studies with special emphasis on biodiversity valuation in order to depict the state-of-the-art in this research field. It develops evaluation criteria so as to identify best-practice applications and shows that the field of biodiversity valuation studies is rather heterogeneous regarding both valuation objects and valuation methods. On the basis of our evaluation criteria and best-practice studies we suggest that to account for the complexity and abstractness of biodiversity, multi-attribute approaches with encompassing information provision should be used that emphasise the roles biodiversity plays for human well-being.

This article uses the detailed information on weekly hours of work and wages contained in the New Survey of London Life and Labour (NSLLL) (1928-32) to provide the first estimation of both the participation and the hours-of-work decisions for female workers prior to the Second World War. The main finding is that the labour supply curve was negatively slopedwomen worked longer hours at lower wages. It is also possible to compare the determinants of the labour force participation decision and the hours of work decision among females in the NSLLL. It appears that the labour force participation decision was more strongly related to household income level than to own wages, while the hours of work decision among working women was more strongly related to the wage level than to household income. Finally, the article also examines the differential labour market behaviour of married women, female household heads, and young single women; most striking among these results is the evident added-worker effect on married women of the onset of the Great Depression in 1930.","Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Bean, JS (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,32,4,4,2,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We use data envelopment analysis to compute the attacking, defensive and overall efficiencies of the top 100 male professional players for the 2009 season. An analysis of the efficiency scores using non-parametric kernel smoothing suggests that there are four groups of players in the sample-those that are relatively efficient in attack and defence; those that are relatively inefficient in attack and defence; and those that are relatively efficient in attack or defence. Truncated regression equations for the technical and super attacking, defensive and overall efficiencies as a function of off-court variables (e.g. height, age, etc.) suggest that being a left-handed player has a significant positive effect on the overall efficiencies.","[Glass, Anthony J.; Kenjegalieva, Karligash; Taylor, Jason] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Kenjegalieva, K (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",A.J.Glass@lboro.ac.uk; K.A.Kenjegalieva@lboro.ac.uk; J.L.Rave@lboro.ac.uk,,"Glass, Anthony/0000-0002-5984-7666; Glass, Karligash/0000-0001-7323-077X",,,,,29,6,6,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Although most of the regions in Mediterranean Europe are affected by soil degradation driven by unsustainable grazing, information on the spatial relationship among overgrazing, the economic structure and socio-spatial attributes of rural communities is limited. The present study explores the relationship between an index of grazing pressure and a set of indicators assessing six thematic domains (Population dynamics and human settlement, Labour market and human capital, Economic specialization and competitiveness, Quality of life, Agriculture and rural development Territory and environment) at the municipal scale in Italy. An exploratory data analysis based on non-parametric inference, multiple regression models, Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering was developed with the aim to profile municipalities exposed to high or low degree of grazing pressure. An index of overgrazing-driven soil degradation risk which integrates grazing intensity and soil erosion risk was finally proposed. The analysis contributes to identify socioeconomic factors influencing soil degradation in areas with unsustainable grazing possibly leading to desertification risk.

As predicted on the basis of the contemporary literature on crowding-out effects, we find that the compulsory pension reduced the demand for life insurance. Our panel-data analysis of lapse rates on insurance policies shows a significant crowding-out effect of pension payments.

Results indicate that the relative technical state of a home can significantly influence the performance of demand-side interventions, particularly the presence of a programmable thermostat. Within air conditioning, we generally find that enough consistent technical improvement is needed to realize energy savings, which could be due to engineering building performance or a declining marginal rebound effect as householders become thermally comfortable. Results indicate that homeowners do not leverage efficiency gains for appliance services but demonstrate mixed results when considering the expansion of electricity services. Householders may rebound into device loads, albeit such results are not statistically significant. However, results indicate that householders do not leverage efficiency gains for electric vehicles. These results demonstrate that the net effect of technological change in households is relative to a home's baseline technical efficiency and the degree to which homeowners seek new and existing energy services, challenging empirical assessments that do not control for the technical state of multiple end uses.

Tests of the Geary-Stark method confirm that it generates accurate estimates of regional GDP. There are practical and conceptual problems with Crafts' extension, and it is not tested nor is it testable. New estimates of regional GDP for the period 1861 to 1911 contradict Crafts's suggestion of rising regional inequality. Purchasing power parity adjustments do not alter this trend. The new estimates confirm Ireland's post-Famine catch-up. The great bulk of Irish labour productivity growth can be accounted for by an upward shifting production function, though it can be argued that that portion of growth that represents catch-up may be attributable to labour force decline.",,,,,,"Stark, Thomas/0000-0003-1059-5047",,,,,47,31,32,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The purpose of this paper is to: first, experiments should excavate new recipes, production processes and narratives for mussels with a specific regional origin and connotation. Second, the study should test a lead user set-up and investigate the commitment and potential benefits, not only for future mussel producers but also for the lead users themselves. Design/methodology/approach - This study organized and evaluated a lead user experiment involving eight chefs and other food experts. Findings - The experiment was successful in the sense that the lead users activated a considerable combinatory knowledge ability and creativity, and they could address issues of wider regional branding significance and contribute with catching narratives. The lead users found the experiment beneficial on several dimensions, providing the opportunity to reflect and undertake tests under respectfully inquisitive observation of others, and they also appreciated the opportunity openly to expose their own professionalism on various media that were organized as ingredients in this experiment. Practical implications - The study accentuates the applicability of lead user experiments as supplements or alternative to other ways of informing product development processes and demonstrates a practical method. Originality/value - The study contributes to the increasing methodological evidence in the field of lead user-based innovation and scrutinizes the issues in a wider food industry context.","[Hjalager, Anne-Mette; Johansen, Pia Heike; Rasmussen, Bjorn] Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Ctr Rural Res, Esbjerg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Hjalager, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Ctr Rural Res, Esbjerg, Denmark.",hjalager@sam.sdu.dk,"Hjalager, Anne-Mette/J-5454-2017","Hjalager, Anne-Mette/0000-0001-5648-4401",,,,,36,8,8,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis combines recipes, dietary records and food waste data from a school meal intervention with collected price data within an economic optimization framework. Findings - A New Nordic School meal programme consisting of a morning snack and a hot lunch based on fixed seasonal menu plans and with 75 per cent organic content is 37 per cent more expensive in terms of ingredient costs than corresponding packed school meals. This cost differential can be almost halved by introducing more flexible scheduling of week plans and reducing the level of organic ambition to 60 per cent. Reducing portion sizes could reduce the cost differential by an extra 5 per cent, which would also reduce food waste by about 15 per cent.

Consumer practices related to these foods have been studied in many countries, however, little comparison has been made among different countries. The purpose of this paper is to characterize consumers' purchase, storage, handling, and preparation of poultry products and eggs in four European countries: Russia, Estonia, Italy, and Spain. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 100 selected consumers in each location completed a questionnaire that included sections about poultry products and eggs purchase temperatures and locations, storage locations such as refrigerator, freezer, or cabinet, and preparation such as washing eggs and poultry before cooking, and the use of cutting boards. Findings - Although educating consumers in European countries is common, some food safety aspects may need to be additionally addressed. The results indicated differences in purchase and storage practices of raw eggs. In Russia and Estonia consumers who participated in the study purchased both refrigerated and room temperature eggs whereas in Italy (84 percent) and Spain (87 percent) eggs typically were purchased at room temperature. However, almost all consumers in all countries stored eggs in the refrigerator. In Russia 70 percent of the consumers who participated in the study immediately froze raw meat, poultry, or seafood after purchase; while in other countries about a quarter of the consumers froze the raw meat. Research limitations/implications - This research was limited by the number of respondents in each country that does not allow extrapolation of results. Originality/value - Food preparation practices revealed behavior that supports cross-contamination during cooking, such as washing raw poultry and eggs. A uniform approach to food safety practices related research, such as presented in this study, would help define overlapping critical points in consumer behavior and create educational messages based on the information gathered.","[Koppel, Kadri; Di Donfrancesco, Brizio; Chambers, Edgar] Kansas State Univ, Sensory Anal Ctr, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Timberg, Loreida] Tallinn Univ Technol, Food Proc Dept, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Shalimov, Roman] Tochka Rosta, Moscow, Russia; [Vazquez-Araujo, Laura] Univ Vigo, Dept Chem Engn, As Lagoas, Spain; [Carbonell-Barracchina, Angel A.] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Agri Food Technol, Orihuela, Spain",Kansas State University; Tallinn University of Technology; Universidade de Vigo; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"Koppel, K (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Sensory Anal Ctr, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",kadri@ksu.edu,"Carbonell-Barrachina, Ángel A./J-6592-2012; VÁZQUEZ-ARAÚJO, LAURA/X-9356-2019; VÁZQUEZ-ARAÚJO, LAURA/T-5773-2017","Carbonell-Barrachina, Ángel A./0000-0002-7163-2975; Chambers, Edgar/0000-0002-2480-0200; VAZQUEZ-ARAUJO, LAURA/0000-0002-4174-9283; Timberg, Loreida/0000-0002-6803-3162; Koppel, Kadri/0000-0002-3429-7047",,,,,33,14,16,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Using food consumption scenarios in an on-line experiment consumers perceived risk and risk tolerance is examined when messages are framed in three different news-type stories. Findings - As anticipated, message framing emerged as a significant predictor of perceived risk and the higher an individual's self-reported tolerance of risk, the more risk they were willing to accept. Research limitations/implications - The use of hypothetical scenarios and relatively small convenience sample size could be improved by further research. Practical implications - Through simple adjustments to wording, food crises of confidence may be reduced and the implications for communication management strategies are discussed. Originality/value - Originality stems from being one of the first papers to use Framing and Prospect Theory in a food crisis situation, in which both risk and framing are operationalised in different ways and the risk was not specified by the researcher. Also, unlike previous research identical numerical facts were framed in a positive, negative or neutral light by changing the wording.","[Mitchell, Vincent Wayne] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Bakewell, Cathy] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Mkt Operat & Digital Business, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Jackson, Paul; Heslin, Claire] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",City University London; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Manchester,"Mitchell, VW (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England.",v.mitchell@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,12,15,3,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

At the same time, if we examine the Top 40 list of Hollywood movies, we can see that the average number of product placements per movie was 17.8 in 2011. (Brandchannel.com, 2012). However, brands do not only appear in movies but also in series, reality shows, talent shows, and so on. This has several reasons: - changes in consumers' relationship to advertising - technological progess, mainly digitalization, - the reform of advertising, - the needs of film and TV show production companies, and - changes of the legal environment. The study addresses all these issues.","[Papp-Vary, Arpad] BKF Univ Appl Sci, Budapest, Hungary",,"Papp-Vary, A (通讯作者)，BKF Univ Appl Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",apappvary@bkf.hu,,,,,,,20,1,2,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,182.0,189.0,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500020,0

With its peculiarities like the life cycle approach, women empowerment, consideration of vulnerable sections in society and proposed reforms in public distribution system (PDS), NFSA is a promising effort for food security in India. The purpose of this paper is to put forth various aspects of NFSA and to identify issues and challenges for its implementation in the light of Indian PDS. Design/methodology/approach - Understanding the implications of NFSA, mapping the existing system of foodgrains distribution in India and analysing existing literature and secondary data available from assorted sources are the steps followed in this endeavour. Findings - Limited resources and exponentially increasing population, lack of infrastructure, operational inefficiencies and poor performance of the PDS are the major hurdles in successful implementation of the proposed act. This study gives emphasis on the need of major reforms in procurement, storage, movement and distribution of foodgrains strategies. Research limitations/implications - This paper focusses mainly on the operational and strategic aspects of PDS and its implications on NFSA. There is a wide scope for future research on sustainability of the act through agricultural and biotechnological innovations, financial analysis and strategic aspects. Originality/value - This study is an unique attempt of mapping and auditing of the entire complex value chain of the Indian PDS for implementation of NFSA. As NFSA is going to redefine the food security aspects, this pioneering work will be useful for researchers and policy makers working in this field in India and other developing countries.","[Tanksale, Ajinkya; Jha, J.

The difference with the conventional chain is that in the short supply chain the primary products are locally processed and sold directly by the producer to the consumer. The short supply chain has different microbiological quality and safety aspects in comparison with the conventional chain. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate these aspects. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of analyzing the available scientific literature and results of microbiological analyses on foods from the short supply chain. Findings - The main findings were that Listeria monocytogenes was frequently detected (15 percent) in sampled raw dairy products whereas Salmonella was not isolated in 1,023 samples. Human pathogenic vero (cyto) toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Campylobacter spp. are potential hazards, in particular for products that are not thermally treated. Data with regard to E. coli counts showed a greater variability in products from the short supply chain compared to the conventional chain. Research limitations/implications - The paper discusses strengths and weaknesses with impact on microbial quality and safety in operation of food safety management in the short supply chain vs the conventional chain. Originality/value - This is the first paper that assesses the risks from the short supply chain vs the conventional chain and that makes recommendations for operators in the short supply chain.","[Verraes, Claire] Fed Agcy Safety Food Chain, Staff Direct Risk Assessment, DG Control Policy, Brussels, Belgium; [Uyttendaele, Mieke] Univ Ghent, Food Safety & Food Qual, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Clinquart, Antoine; Daube, Georges] Univ Liege, Food Sci, Fac Vet Med, Liege, Belgium; [Sindic, Marianne] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Liege, Belgium; [Berkvens, Dirk] Inst Trop Med, Biomed Sci, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Herman, Lieve] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res, Technol & Food Sci Unit, Melle, Belgium",Ghent University; University of Liege; University of Liege; Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM); Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research,"Verraes, C (通讯作者)，Fed Agcy Safety Food Chain, Staff Direct Risk Assessment, DG Control Policy, Brussels, Belgium.",claire.verraes@favv.be,"穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022; Daube, Georges MN/A-7582-2011","Daube, Georges/0000-0002-9282-8408",,,,,35,14,14,5,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The implications of this on the role of food regulators are considered. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 42 food regulators from Australia, New Zealand and the UK participated in a semi-structured interview about their response to food incidents and issues of food regulation more generally. Data were analysed thematically. Findings - Food regulators have a key role in communicating information to consumers about food safety and food incidents. This is done in two main ways: proactive and reactive communication. The majority of regulators said that consumers do not have a good understanding of what food regulation involves and there were varied views on whether or not this is important. Practical implications - Both reactive and proactive communication with consumers are important, however there are clear benefits in food regulators communicating proactively with consumers, including a greater understanding of the regulators' role. Regulators should be supported to communicate proactively where possible. Originality/value - There is a lack of information about how food regulators communicate with consumers about food safety and how food regulators perceive consumers to understand food regulation.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were carried out in Bangkok and nearby cities. The key informants were experts, governmental authorities, producers, distributors, exporters, and consumers. A qualitative content-summarising approach was used to analyse the interview transcripts. Findings - Stakeholders perceived the credibility of national GAP (Q-GAP) standards implemented in the Thai domestic market as low, due to a lack of reliable verification and traceability and because the system is managed by governmental bodies. Consumer demand could drive the market of safe produce, but retail stores are the main influencers of producers' adoption of GAPs in domestic markets. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a small group of Thai fresh produce industry players and consumers who operate mainly in an urban context. Practical implications - The paper provides relevant information for policy makers and industrialists to find appropriate strategies to sustain GAPs in Thailand. Stakeholder awareness of food safety issues and information provision are crucial. Originality/value - This is the first in-depth study of stakeholders' perceptions of GAP implementation in the Thai fresh produce supply chain as the industry is currently transitioning from a commodity market to a quality/safety-oriented market. The results raise important issues regarding GAP adoption, food safety certification, and labelling in Thailand.","[Wongprawmas, Rungsaran; Canavari, Maurizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy; [Waisarayutt, Chutima] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Agroind Technol, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Bologna; Kasetsart University,"Wongprawmas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy.",rungsaran.wongprawmas80@gmail.com,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880",,,,,40,17,17,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Diverse indicators have different units of measurement, and normalization is the procedure employed to transform differing indicator measures onto similar scales or to unit-free measures. Given the inherent complexity entailed in interpreting information related to multiple indicators, normalization and aggregation of sustainability indicators are common steps after indicator measures are quantified. However, it is often difficult for stakeholders to make clear connections between specific indicator measurements and resulting aggregate scores of sustainability. Motivated by challenges and examples in sustainability assessment, this paper explores various normalization schemes including ratio normalization, target normalization, Z-score normalization, and unit equivalence normalization. Methods for analyzing the impacts of normalization choice on aggregate scores are presented. Techniques are derived for general application in studying composite indicators, and advantages and drawbacks associated with different normalization schemes are discussed within the context of sustainability assessment. Theoretical results are clarified through a case study using data from indicators of progress towards bioenergy sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Pollescha, N.

This study, however, argues that recent international free trade agreements have tended to enhance environmental cooperation among participating countries. This study has examined the process by which East Asian countries have developed mechanisms for the extant level of regional environmental cooperation, particularly highlighting the reasons for commonalities and differences in regional environmental cooperation between ASEAN and the dominant economies in the region. It finds that three factors particularly matter for developing regional environmental cooperative mechanisms: networks of intergovernmental organizations, the strong willingness of political leaders which is often embodied in national strategies for regionalism and the establishment, and the institutionalized linkage-particularly through FTAs-between trade and the environment. Tracing the process of policy evolution within three groups of countries sheds light on the political conditions under which the four entities involved (the ASEAN, Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea) have produced and strengthened cooperative environmental mechanisms among them along with free trade agreements. Focusing especially on the environmental policy changes in Japan, China, and the ROK associated with the creation of its FTAs with ASEAN, the study concludes that each of free trade agreements has incrementally developed environmental cooperation, especially when integrated into a vision for regional integration.","[Yoo, In Tae] Yonsei Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Inkyoung] Reed Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA",Yonsei University; Reed College - Oregon,"Kim, I (通讯作者)，Reed Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",seemyself@gmail.com,,"Yoo, In Tae/0000-0002-8711-5112; Kim, Inkyoung/0000-0003-0657-3304",,,,,52,9,10,2,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The change implies reduced fee-for-service and increased fixed budget for a contracted volume of services. A consequence of the change is that private providers have less incentive to conduct examinations beyond the contracted volume. Different from the situation observed before the change in 2008, the volume is no longer determined by the demand side, and a rationing of the supply occurs. We employ data on radiological examinations initiated by GPs' referrals. We apply monthly data at the physician-practice level for 2007-2010. The data set is unique because it includes information about all GPs in the Norwegian patient-list system. The results indicate that private providers conducted fewer examinations in 2008-2010 compared with previous periods and that public hospitals did either the same volume or more. We find that GPs who operate in a more competitive environment experienced a greater reduction in magnetic resonance imaging, both performed by private providers and in total for their patients. We argue that this result supports a hypothesis that patients with lower expected benefits are rationed. Hence, rationing from the supply side might supplement GP gatekeeping.","[Iversen, Tor; Mokienko, Anastasia] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, POB 1089, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Iversen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, POB 1089, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",tor.iversen@medisin.uio.no,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Using a constructed measure of health information, we find evidence for supplier-induced demand in some parts of Switzerland. While the level of health information is uncorrelated with the likelihood of visiting a physician (contact decision), the conditional number of visits (frequency decision) depends on the individual's information status and the regulation of physician drug dispensing. In cantons with a drug prescription scheme, we do not find a significant difference in the number of visits between well-informed individuals and people with relatively little health literacy. In contrast, the existence of self-dispensing general practitioner and specialists is associated with a gap in demand that is strongly related to health literacy: Compared to cantons with prescription schemes, uninformed patients exhibit a higher number of outpatient visits in the cantons that (partly) allow the dispensation of drugs by physicians. However, patients with a high level of health information seem to be rather unaffected by physician drug dispensing. As a consequence, we observe an information-related gap in the number of outpatient contacts that only prevails in areas where doctors are entitled to sell drugs themselves. These findings suggest that self-dispensing doctors succeed in inducing demand that affects the number of physician-patient contacts. Health literacy, on the other hand, tends to counter these incentives.","[Meyer, Stefan] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ WWZ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ WWZ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",stefan.meyer@unibas.ch,,"Meyer, Stefan/0000-0003-1743-1096",,,,,32,3,4,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

We investigate the local economic value of Eastern Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) to two communities in Baja California Sur, Mexico, that benefit from nature-based tourism associated with the whales. Using a producer side approach and data for 2006, we estimate the economic rent associated with whale watching in 2006 and then examine the distribution of that rent among local stakeholders. We find a substantial local value associated with the presence of gray whales, with the largest share (two-thirds) going to the whale watching owner-operators. Our findings suggest that increasing the whale watching price in 2006 would have been a cost-effective strategy for increasing the rent captured locally from whale watching.

I argue that an auto industry supply shock contributed both to the recession's anomalies and to its severity. Labor-strife-induced wage increases and an increase in raw material costs led auto manufacturers to raise prices in fall 1937. Expectations of these price increases brought auto sales forward. When auto prices finally rose, sales plummeted. This shock likely reduced 1938 auto sales by roughly 600,000 units and 1938 GDP growth by 0.5-1 percentage point.","[Hausman, Joshua K.] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 S State St 3309, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hausman, Joshua K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 735 S State St 3309, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hausman, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 S State St 3309, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Hausman, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 735 S State St 3309, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hausmanj@umich.edu,,,Economic History Association,Economic History Association,"I thank J.

Health systems performance is generally evaluated on how different factors contribute to mortality and longevity. Fewer studies scrutinize the factors that determine morbidity in different countries, partly because indicators that assess morbidity on a country level are not as widely available as mortality and longevity data. We introduce a new health status indicator able to combine mortality and morbidity in a single composite measure for each country and gender at a point in time (LEAPHS), yielding the average number of years that men (women) can expect to live in good (or better) health. Using the Sullivan method we combine the mortality risk, calculated for specific age and gender groups, with perceived health status for the same age and gender groups, and we estimate how medical care and various socio-economic, environmental and structural, lifestyle, and technological factors affect LEAPHS and life expectancy at birth for a large panel of thirty OECD countries. We find that some variables (alcohol consumption, urbanization) have a significant effect on both LEAPHS and life expectancy, while one variable (the number of hospitals) has a significant effect for both genders on life expectancy only. However, the effects of many other variables (health expenditure per capita, health expenditure per capita squared, GDP growth, and technology) were only significant predictors for LEAPHS. This leads us to conclude that LEAPHS is able to capture the impact of some health determinants not captured by life expectancy at birth. While we believe this new measure may be useful for health economists and statisticians doing cross-country analyses, further comparisons with other measures may be useful.","[Laranjeira, Erika] Lusiada Univ, CEF UP, Rua Dr Lopo de Carvalho, P-4369006 Oporto, Portugal; [Laranjeira, Erika] Lusiada Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Rua Dr Lopo de Carvalho, P-4369006 Oporto, Portugal; [Szrek, Helena] Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Szrek, Helena] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Laranjeira, E (通讯作者)，Lusiada Univ, CEF UP, Rua Dr Lopo de Carvalho, P-4369006 Oporto, Portugal.;Laranjeira, E (通讯作者)，Lusiada Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Rua Dr Lopo de Carvalho, P-4369006 Oporto, Portugal.",090421014@fep.up.pt; hszrek@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Laranjeira, Erika/0000-0003-2957-9020; Szrek, Helena/0000-0002-5154-4679",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; FEDER; FSE [SFRH/BD/63309/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/63309/2009] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); FSE(European Social Fund (ESF)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, FEDER and FSE for research grant SFRH/BD/63309/2009.

The analysis estimates a panel data of rice farming in Japan using a time-varying transition probability Markov switching model, capturing (i) the alternate regimes of agro-ecosystems, (ii) the controlling factors affecting the regime shifts of agro-ecosystems, and (iii) the nonmonotonic response of agricultural production under alternate regimes. Results show that the effect of crop diversity on agro-ecosystem productivity differs depending on its regimes. Crop diversity increases productivity during normal periods, a normal regime, while it decreases the productivity during periods exposed to disturbances such as extreme weather events and disease and insect damage, an adverse regime. Further, we find that crop diversity enhances the agro-ecosystem resilience. Thus, it increases the likelihood of the agro-ecosystem remaining in a normal regime and staving off an adverse regime. The crop diversity loss has gradually increased in agro-ecosystems without sufficient understanding about the linkage between crop diversity and agro-ecosystem resilience. Our findings suggest the possibility that the agro-ecosystem resilience would be a key driver of sustainable agriculture under increasing uncertainties.

We investigate the sources of this perception of unfairness and its implications for policymaking. We examine the distributive effects of British Columbia's carbon tax using a computable general equilibrium model of the Canadian economy. We find that the rural population would indeed have experienced a disproportionate burden had the carbon tax been introduced without redistributive measures, but that the revenue recycling program introduced in parallel with the tax was sufficient to balance the inequity. Hence, the Northern and Rural Homeowner Benefit Program, a transfer program introduced later in response to public protests, was unnecessary. Additionally, analysis of polling data shows that the new program failed to increase support for the carbon tax in rural communities, despite making these households better off on average than households in large urban centers. We therefore conclude that this ongoing opposition is based on a rural myth. Policymakers should carefully investigate distributive impacts of carbon policies and address evidential inequities. Yet, before overcompensating groups that still feel disadvantaged, policymakers should address the myth of unfairness at its source. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While the impact of objective features of the environment (e.g., pollution, parks) is well-researched, the present paper fills a research gap by analyzing how concerns about the environment impact on subjective well-being. Based on German panel data (SOEP) for the years 1984-2012, we show that egoistic concerns have a negative impact on subjective well-being while altruistic concerns are positively associated with well-being, an effect likely driven by omitting variables for environmental activism such as volunteer work. We show that environmental concerns also lead to an increased propensity to volunteer and such volunteering is positively associated with well-being, but only for those who are very concerned about the environment.

The purpose of this paper is to quantify how much such claims would change the willingness to pay (WTP) for organic products in Croatia. Design/methodology/approach - For estimating the WTP under different claims the authors used an experimental auction. Participants (258) bid for real food products (organic and conventional tomatoes and apples) and are endowed with cash at a location where they usually go shopping. Findings - For the sample the authors find that consumers are willing to pay on average a premium of 42 percent for organic apples and 59 percent for organic tomatoes. On top of that, WTP increases between 16-20 percent for environmental claims and 12 percent for health claims. Taste-related claims are not significant. Practical implications - Sellers and producers of organic food can benefit from adding claims to organic labels. To protect consumers from manipulation, regulators are well advised to be cautions when allowing claims about credence attributes of food. Originality/value - The authors quantify the influence of claims about organic products on the WTP by using experimental auctions which are particularly suitable to investigate effects which cannot be observed on the market.","[Cagalj, Marin] Inst Adriat Crops & Karst Reclamat, Dept Appl Sci, Split, Croatia; [Haas, Rainer] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Inst Mkt & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Morawetz, Ulrich B.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria","Institute for Adriatic Crops and Karst Reclamation Split; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Cagalj, M (通讯作者)，Inst Adriat Crops & Karst Reclamat, Dept Appl Sci, Split, Croatia.",marin.cagalj@krs.hr,"Morawetz, Ulrich B./U-8875-2017; Cagalj, Marin/ABF-1128-2020; Haas, Rainer/A-1571-2013","Cagalj, Marin/0000-0003-4193-7759; Morawetz, Ulrich/0000-0002-5481-8292; Haas, Rainer/0000-0002-7854-8960",,,,,46,16,19,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze three main topics: the general features of HACCP management, the difficulties linked to its application and managers relations with food public control system. Design Methodology/approach - Surveys were taken of managers of restaurants/hotel and bars. The questionnaires were completed through personal.face-torface interviews, phone interviews and by e-mail. Respondents evaluated their agreement/disagreement with the statements proposed on a Likert scale. Findings - The results show HoReCa managers perceive that the benefits derived from application of HACCP are greater than the costs. In addition they believe that it is impossible to achieve food safety without HACCP application. Managers also think that the high turnover of staff constitutes a great harrier to HACCP efficiency. Moreover, they believe that food public control system provides elements that make it possible to continuously improve-HACCP.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the potential of flaxseed-enriched cookies as carriers of lignans and omega-3 fatty acids - functional compounds that are lacking in the western diet. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire collected data from Croatian consumers (n = 1,035). The majority of the samples were women (73 per cent) in the age range 15-65 years (97 per cent). Most participants were employed, had a higher education degree, and lived in urban areas. Questions examined the consumption of cookies and flaxseed, interest for functional cookies, nutritional knowledge, and awareness. Findings - Majority of subjects consumed cookies (93 per cent), while 61 per cent did not eat flaxseed or ate it less than once a month. The consumers showed elevated interest for the functional cookies with flaxseed, among which elderly women with higher nutrition awareness, and nutrition knowledge were the most interested. Functional cookies with flaxseed could be used for delivery of lignans and omega-3 fatty acids in everyday diet, but in order to reach wider range of consumers producers might benefit from employing nutritional educational marketing campaigns. Originality/value - Data from the study decreased scarcity of information on consumer behaviour related to flaxseed consumption and on potential use of cookies as a functional food. Reported findings will be useful to dieticians, food industry, and food researchers in countries with a high prevalence of cookie consumption.","[Cukelj, Nikolina; Putnik, Predrag; Novotni, Dubravka; Ajredini, Sasa; Voucko, Bojana; Curic, Duska] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Curic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Zagreb, Croatia.",dcuric@pbf.hr,"Putnik, Predrag/B-6495-2016; Cukelj Mustac, Nikolina/HDO-5189-2022","Putnik, Predrag/0000-0003-0342-6114; Cukelj Mustac, Nikolina/0000-0002-5255-2910",,,,,33,14,16,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper underlines the main directions of specialization small farms have found to follow in different Central and Eastern European countries, thereby strengthening their chances of survival. It has been concluded that the growth and development of small, specialized farms has gone in different directions. Some types of small, specialized farms have achieved faster development and achieved better results in increasing efficiency than others. Analysis provides grounds to support the contention that small farms have found further specialization as path of development helping them to survive; but that the speed with which specialization has been achieved varies according to countries and according to farm types.","[Forgacs, Csaba] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Forgacs, C (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",csaba.forgacs@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,12,4,4,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,221.0,227.0,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700031,0

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 13 technical and new product development (NPD) managers were purposefully sampled from businesses supplying foods within the chilled convenience food sector. Data were generated using semi-structured interviews incorporating the critical incident technique. Thematic and comparative analyses identified similarities and differences in the challenges facing different product categories within the sector. Findings - Barriers to further salt reduction included: manufacturing limitations; NPD constraints; food safety, quality and shelf-life trade-offs; and organoleptic acceptance.

This indicates on the necessity to analyse the performance of credit unions. The research aim is to identify the features and performance characteristics of the credit unions based on a particular insight into the operation of credit unions in the Baltic States. It was concluded that in many countries credit unions were operating at a loan-to-asset ratio which was much lower than the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) requirements. Among the Baltic States, Lithuania is the leader in terms of credit unions as it almost twice outpaces Latvia, while Estonia considerably lags behind. In Latvia, credit unions have managed to preserve a stable increase related to attraction of savings and deposits. This means that the members trust credit unions and see the significance and convenience joining them.

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was utilized to gather the data (n = 300) for this study. The purposive sampling technique was used, involving respondents who practice a green lifestyle and have had green product purchasing experience. The partial least squares (PLS) method, which is a variance-based technique for the analysis of structural equation modeling, was used to analyze the data, with the assistance of the SmartPLS computer program version 2.0. Findings - Based on the standardized path coefficients of the structural model from the PLS results, green brand knowledge was found to be the most significant determinant of green product purchase intention. Knowledge of green brands has caused consumers to develop positive green marketing awareness and has bolstered their interest in fortifying the environment whilst preventing its degradation. Furthermore, green brand knowledge also impacted consumers' attitude toward green brands. However, this factor was an insignificant moderator of the impact between green brand positioning and green product purchase intention. Practical implications - Green brand positioning can be used by firms and businesses to better market their products and improve consumers' green brand knowledge and attitude toward green brands, as well as increase green brand purchase intentions. Successful green brand positioning is seen as an advantage for marketers that can be used to differentiate their products from the available competitors, giving the impression that their products are distinguishable, and thus creating more demand and generating increased intention to purchase more green products. Originality/value - The empirical results of this study address the gap in the prevailing body of literature in reference to the impact of green brand positioning and consumer attitude toward green brands, as well as the effect of green brand knowledge on green product purchase intention. This study found that green brand knowledge does not moderate the relationship between green brand positioning and green product purchase intention, thus providing insight into this subject matter, which has not been clearly examined in previous studies.","[Suki, Norazah Mohd] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Labuan, Malaysia",,"Suki, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Labuan, Malaysia.",azahsuki@yahoo.com,"Mohd Suki, Norazah/C-9312-2016","Mohd Suki, Norazah/0000-0002-8422-2449",,,,,76,177,186,33,228,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper explores Lotka's contribution to biophysical economics resulting from the marriage of the three disciplines: biology, physics and economics. Lotka founded the concept of exosomatic evolution to characterise the economic activities in their biophysical environment as a continuation of biological processes. Like Vernadsky, he adopted a holistic perspective of planet-system - the biosphere. Georgescu-Roegen was one of the founders of ecological economics. He explained the entropic nature of evolution and adopted Lotka's exosomatic evolution concept in his bioeconomic approach. Georgescu-Roegen had several warnings for economists about the irrevocability of the entropic degradation of matter-energy and the pressure on natural resources that goes hand in hand with economic processes in general. This article aims at drawing a parallel between Lotka's contribution and Georgescu-Roegen's bioeconomics, by shedding light not only on their similarities, but also on the divergences that testify the novelty of Georgescu-Roegen's approach.

Bartkowski et al. (2015) reveal a critical weakness: that biodiversity has rarely, if ever, been defined in economic valuations of putative biodiversity. Here we argue that a precise definition is available and could help focus valuation studies, but that in using this scientific definition (a three-dimensional measure of total difference), valuation by stated-preference methods becomes, at best, very difficult. We reclassify the valuation studies reviewed by Bartkowski et al. (2015) to better reflect the biological definition of biodiversity and its potential indirect use value as the support for provisioning and regulating services. Our analysis shows that almost all of the studies reviewed by Bartkowski et al. (2015) were not about biodiversity, but rather were about the 'vague notion' of naturalness, or sometimes a specific biological component of diversity. Alternative economic methods should be found to value biodiversity as it is defined in natural science. We suggest options based on a production function analogy or cost-based methods. Particularly the first of these provides a strong link between economic theory and ecological research and is empirically practical. Since applied science emphasizes a scientific definition of biodiversity in the design and justification of conservation plans, the need for economic valuation of this quantitative meaning of biodiversity is considerable and as yet unfulfilled.

Efficiency and resilience have been compared in complex systems, but the data and materials have mainly been derived from natural ecosystems. The actual environmental impacts of this comparison with data and materials from human economic systems is an important research theme for ecological economics. Furthermore, efficiency defined as eco-efficiency is missing from resilience research. This paper studies resilience and eco-efficiency in societal energy systems. Eco-efficiency is defined as energy produced per CO2 emissions and incineration ash generated. For resilience, we use the diversity of fuel types in energy systems, in particular the evenness of fuels in each fuel type category. Empirical materials from the district heating energy system of Southern Lapland in Finland encompassing six municipalities are presented. What if-scenarios show that, in general, diversity and eco-efficiency seem to support each other, i.e., there is a correlation. This is different from food web studies in ecology where the material flows are primarily biomass. In human energy systems, lithosphere derived materials are used alongside biomass, in our case study fossil coal, oil as well as peat, which is a semi-fossil fuel. The difference might also be explained due to the role of technology in human economic systems. For policy and business strategy implications, it is important to study the case system with two interdependent system boundaries; the subsystem level of the capital city Rovaniemi and the larger six municipality regional system to which Rovaniemi belongs. Policy planning and business strategy development would gain if the actors involved would approach the system with enlarged spatial and temporal system boundaries. Long-term strategic thinking and inter-municipality cooperation may help the region to mitigate the risks related to the development of the district heating energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Woodfuels and forests play an important role for climate change mitigation, by their ability to replace fossil fuel and sequester atmospheric carbon. At the same time, wood extraction is an important driver for deforestation. However, large uncertainties relate to the amount and spatio-temporal pattern of wood use. We here present a comprehensive assessment of wood biomass flows in 11 world regions from 1990 to 2010. We found that global total biomass appropriation (TBA) amounts to 1.81 GtC/year in 1990 and 1.94 GtC/year in 2010 (+7%). In 2010, TBA represents 4% of the global forest net primary production. Only 54% of TBA enters socioeconomic systems while 46% remain in forests or represent waste flows. About 56% of economically used wood biomass enters the energy sector. There are considerable regional variations in wood biomass flows among world regions, owing to differences in population, affluence, and area. Global demand for wood is expected to increase in the near future, putting additional pressure to forest ecosystems. We discuss the potential of cascading use of wood as a means to reduce impacts related to resource use. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we seek to investigate the willingness of residents in rapidly eroding coastal zones to contribute towards the costs of constructing and maintaining such structures. The originality of this paper is that it provides one of the first analyses of the influence of social capital parameters (social trust, institutional trust, social reciprocity and social networks) on respondents' willingness to pay (WIT). Fieldwork for the study was conducted in Romney Marsh, a low-lying coastal area of south-east England. The findings have substantive public policy implications for coastal management. First is that we demonstrate that while social and institutional trust exerts a positive influence on WTP, the presence of social networks militates against WTP. Secondly while the study found 45.6% of respondents were willing to pay an average monthly premium of 3.53 pound, a high level of refusal to pay was evident among respondents. Thirdly even among those respondents willing to pay, disagreement was expressed over the political-administrative level at which a 'coastal defence tax' should be collected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite these services, mangroves are being lost at rapid rates around the world. Using the best available biophysical and socio-economic data, we present the first rigorous large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) at conserving mangroves and reducing blue carbon emissions. We focus on Indonesia as it has the largest absolute area of mangroves (about 22.6% of the world's mangroves), is one of the most diverse in terms of mangrove species and has been losing its mangroves at a very fast rate. Specifically, we apply quasi-experimental techniques (combining propensity score and covariate matching, differences-indifferences, and post-matching bias adjustments) to assess whether PAs prevented mangrove loss between 2000 and 2010. Our results show that marine protected areas reduced mangrove loss by about 14,000 ha and avoided blue carbon emissions of approximately 13 million metric tons (CO2 equivalent). However, we find no evidence that species management PAs stalled the loss of mangroves. We conclude by providing illustrative estimates of the blue carbon benefits of establishing PAs, which can be cost-effective policies for mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss.

It is conducted for supporting decision-making and policy in a broad environmental, economic and social context, and transcends a purely technical/scientific evaluation. This paper focusses on the systematisation of knowledge on technical/scientific sustainability evaluation, by addressing critical decision-making elements focussed on by domain experts. We make a distinction between integrated assessment and SA. Our systemic approach outlines how to move from integrated assessment to SA. The fundamental differences involved concern three levels: ontological, methodological and epistemological. We present a novel methodological framework for SA, based on a literature meta-review of multi-scale and multipurpose appraisal methodologies, models and indicators. SA is essentially a structured procedure encompassing different field-specific analytical methods and models, for specific applications and decision contexts. External inputs to the methodology are values considered in the analysis and boundaries defined, including the relevant sustainability framework. Internal methodological elements comprise approach to be adopted (e.g. what-if' vs. what-to), scenario design and analytical models and measurable indicators for an operational analysis.

In this theoretical paper, we present alternative flexibility measures that can be used to calculate the ability of the production technology to accommodate output variations at lower costs. We refine the existing short-run multi-output flexibility measure to the long-run using three alternative total cost functions in order to capture the impact of fixed costs on adjustment ability. The proposed new long-run flexibility measures are based on alternative definitions of the long-run total cost function considering various assumptions about the decision-making process. We derive primal flexibility measures by using the dual relationships between these cost functions and the corresponding input distance functions. The proposed measures allow us to investigate both short-run and long-run flexibility using different representations of the production technology, and thus to examine various aspects of the firm's ability to adjust.","[Renner, Swetlana; Glauben, Thomas; Hockmann, Heinrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Renner, Swetlana] Agroscope, Inst Sustainabil Sci ISS, CH-3856 Ettenhausen, Switzerland; [Ouellette, Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Renner, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",swetlana.renner@agroscope.admin.ch; glauben@iamo.de; Hockmann@iamo.de; ouellette.pierre@uqam.ca,"Ouellette, Pierre/GSO-0159-2022; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387",,,,,19,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This article indirectly evaluates MBIs for essential ecosystem services by examining market allocation of another essential resource that is allocated by markets and which has experienced dramatic price increases: food. In an unequal world, markets respond to price increases by reducing food allocations to the destitute and malnourished, but not for the affluent. MBIs would increase the prices of ecosystem services and the commodities whose production degrades them, forcing the impoverished to reduce consumption by more than the wealthy. Furthermore, most MBIs would be prone to speculation and price instability, be incompatible with the satisfaction of individual preferences, or would not maximize economic surplus. Most environmental problems can be characterized as prisoner's dilemmas, which are best solved through cooperation, not competition. Society must create economic institutions that promote cooperation and ensure that the burdens of reducing throughput are not borne disproportionately by the poor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate this issue, we examine a model with two sectors: the local sector and the external sector. Physical capital accumulation in the latter sector is driven by foreign direct investments, while in the former sector it follows a Solow-type accumulation mechanism. We assume that the production activity of the external sector damages the environment while the local sector relies on natural resources. In this context, we give the conditions under which capital inflows can promote diversification of host economy while improving welfare of local populations. If these conditions are not satisfied, external investments fuel a welfare reducing process (for the local community) and a self-enforcing growth of the external sector at the expense of the local one.

Due to the similarities between the institutional culture of eighteenth-century Britain and those within many contemporary developing societies, social scientists have also sought to draw lessons from Britain's historical experience of corruption. Yet little is known about the extent, impact, and causes of corruption by eighteenth-century office holders. This article presents the first detailed research into the topic. It utilises the rich administrative and financial records associated with the institution charged with funding and undertaking the maintenance of London Bridgethe Bridge Houseto conduct a systematic qualitative and quantitative study of corruption by office holders. The article identifies an ingrained culture of corruption amongst Bridge House officers, and provides quantitative evidence of the substantial impact corruption had on the organization's finances. However, contrary to existing studies on corruption, this article concludes that, although extensive and significant, corruption did not perform a functional role in the context of this institution. The article also provides a methodology and comparator for future studies into this topic.","Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Latham, M (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank Manuel Llorca, Anne Murphy, Roey Sweet, Monica Pena Corona Rodriguez, and Alan Latham for their comments on drafts of this paper.

A variable cost function that is augmented with indices of dairy cows' genetic merit in different groups of traits is estimated by using farm-level panel data. Our results show that a genetic progress of one standard deviation in production and functional traits reduces variable costs by 0.4 and 0.6 %, respectively. The cumulative variable cost reduction from genetic progress in functional traits between 1999 and 2007 is about 1 % for the average farm.

It is well known that an individual's level of social integration is related to the ethnic composition and economic development of an immigrant's residential locality, as well as the generation of the immigrant. Yet, what is not known is whether the social and economic characteristics of adjacent or neighboring localities also influence an individual's level of social integration. Using a multilevel hierarchical analysis with spatial interaction effects, we examine the extent to which four social integration aspects of the bridging social capital of these immigrant groups are related to their ethnicity, their generation, their immediate locality, and the effects of the neighboring localities. Our findings regarding the effects of the ethnic concentration and economic development of the immediate locality along with the immigrant's generation broadly concur with existing studies. At the same time, however, we also find that the features of neighboring localities exert an additional influence on an individual's social integration over and above those related to the immigrant's generation and immediate locality. These additional spatial spillover effects are broadly in line with those associated with the immediate locality, but they are also sensitive to particular proxies for social integration which are employed. These spatial spillover effects on social capital and social integration have not been observed before.","[Tselios, Vassilis] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece; [Noback, Inge; van Dijk, Jouke; McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, NL-19747 AD Groningen, Netherlands",University of Thessaly; University of Groningen,"Tselios, V (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece.",vtselios@prd.uth.gr; i.noback@rug.nl; jouke.van.dijk@rug.nl; p.mccann@rug.nl,"Tselios, Vassilis/ISB-5776-2023; van Dijk, Jouke/J-6558-2019; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Tselios, Vassilis/0000-0001-6330-7278; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,51,21,23,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, such projects have often raised questions regarding their public funding, as they entail considerable costs. This paper reviews cost-benefit analysis (CBA) frameworks as these are presently used to assess bicycle infrastructure projects. Specific focus is on the CBA framework developed in Copenhagen, Denmark, a self-declared city of cyclists. In this framework, costs and benefits of car and bicycle, the two major urban transport modes, have been assessed and are compared across accidents, climate change, health, and travel time. The analysis reveals that each km travelled by car or bike incurs a cost to society, though the cost of car driving is more than six times higher (Euro 0.50/km) than cycling (Euro 0.08/km). Moreover, while the cost of car driving is likely to increase in the future, the cost of cycling appears to be declining. The paper concludes with a discussion of the applicability of the Copenhagen CBA framework to advance sustainable transport planning and to motivate and justify urban restructuring.

Most CWC discoveries are recent, posing new challenges for Norwegian coastal and fishery authorities regarding the management of deep-sea resources. Scientific knowledge of CWC is limited, and many citizens have not even heard about them. This creates problems for the application of the stated preference methods to capture their economic value, and very few such studies have been conducted. To fill this gap, we designed a discrete choice experiment, which was implemented in a valuation workshop setting in order to derive estimates of participants' willingness to pay (WTP) for increasing the protection of CWC Despite the fact that marine industries such as oil/gas and fisheries could be adversely affected by CWC protection, this did not reduce the respondents' willingness to pay for further protection. The possibility that CWCs play an important role as habitat for fish was the single most important variable to explain respondents' WTP for CWC protection. The survey revealed a high degree of preference heterogeneity, while we found an average WTP for CWC protection in the range of EUR 274-287. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Analyses of high-frequency 3 percent consol yield data and historical financial press suggest three conclusions. First, democratic reform episodes were preceded by increases in perceived political risk, comparable to democratizing episodes in other countries. Second, both democratic reform and repression were followed by yield declines. Third, the source of political risk in Britain was both social unrest and political deadlock.

Notably, a unique measure of variable importance is employed that mitigates statistical problems and allows for the ranking of predictors according to their relative influences. Findings reveal that the duration of the local appeal process, decisions of local authorities and inspectors, identities of the appellants, and, projects that conflict with strategic development plans or generate visual externalities emerge as key influences affecting planning approval. Project technology features such as area, rated output capacity, and hub height, as well as site wind endowments, appear to be of less but significant importance.

Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce flood damage are an essential part of modern flood risk management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The final data set covers more than 4200 households from all parts of the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high risk of riverine flooding. The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate flood damage increases i.a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a 'climate adaptation signal' in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase of personal flood damage in the next decades correlates with an increase of the probability of flood mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, empirical evidence for moral hazard in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because of their market position, large-scale and high-volume consumer interactions, food retailers are appropriate venues to entice consumers to buy more sustainable foods. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which food retailers are perceived to have embedded sustainability initiatives in their marketing strategies and to have taken sustainable tactical measures on the store floor. In addition, the study considered the roles played by social identification (SI) and by perceived external prestige (PEP). Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review and semi-structured qualitative interviews with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of Dutch food retailers, the authors conducted an online panel survey among the managers of these food retailers. Findings - The results of the study show the positive impacts of managers' SI with a sustainable consumer group and managers' PEP on the perceived environmental sustainability initiatives of Dutch food retailers. The study finds that managers' SIs are powerful ways to engender employee loyalty. Moreover, organisations that are perceived to have more external prestige are perceived as being more capable of developing sustainability policies. Originality/value - The current study combines views from CEOs of large Dutch food retailers with supermarket manager's perceptions of sustainability initiatives on a strategical and tactical level of an organisation. It uses insights from CSR, food retail and SI theory literature to explain these perceptions.","[Bartels, Jos] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Reinders, Machiel J.; Van Haaster-De Winter, Mariet] Wageningen Univ, The Hague, Netherlands; [Reinders, Machiel J.; Van Haaster-De Winter, Mariet] Agr Econ Res Inst, Res Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research,"Bartels, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.bartels@vu.nl,"Bartels, Jos/AAB-7283-2019; Bartels, Jos/J-3016-2012; Reinders, Machiel/F-7355-2015","Bartels, Jos/0000-0003-1557-6187; Reinders, Machiel/0000-0001-8785-2852",,,,,95,12,13,1,63,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study analyses the data collected from vegetable exporters' associations and the firms' individual financial reports. A multivariate empirical model is developed to measure the impact of cooperation and competition relationships (both horizontal and vertical ones) on exporting. This model includes the influence of main buyers distinguishing basically between retailers and wholesalers. Findings - The results obtained show that diverse forms of collaboration with competitors, in both horizontal (such as logistics and research projects) and vertical dimensions (such as promotion and quality certifications) have positive effects on vegetable export propensity. These influences become more apparent when large retailers are the main buyers. Research limitations/implications - The analysed farming-marketing sector features certain singular characteristics, for example the type of products and firms, which should be taken into account when extrapolating the results to other agrifood industries. Practical implications - For farming-marketing firms with little bargaining power in the supply chain of fresh produce, horizontal and vertical collaboration is a key factor in improving their exporting activity. A greater balance in co-opetition relationships is required to reduce the traditionally negative effect of competition among Spanish firms in the vegetable marketing sector. Originality/value - These findings should be of value to researchers into co-opetition policies and to managers responsible for strategy formation in international agrifood firm environment.","[Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio; Carlos Perez-Mesa, Juan; Lynn Giagnocavo, Cynthia] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Galdeano-Gómez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence,CeiA3, Almeria, Spain.",galdeano@ual.es,"Giagnocavo, Cynthia/AAA-8983-2019; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014","Giagnocavo, Cynthia/0000-0001-9349-9581; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475",Spanish MCINN; FEDER [ECO2011-24930]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-5827],Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid (project ECO2011-24930) and from Junta de Andalucia (project SEJ-5827, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia).",,32,17,17,1,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The survey research was conducted using a questionnaire composed of 73 questions in three areas of general information, sanitation knowledge, and sanitation practices. The respondents were selected from among kitchen staff working in restaurants that were both at least 198 m(2) in size and listed in the Korean Foodservice Information database. The collected data were analyzed to identify the differences between sanitation knowledge and practices. Findings - The results showed that the respondents were well aware of the importance of sanitation during food preparation and cooking whereas they had a relatively lack of personal hygiene. Age and education level of kitchen staff correlated with sanitation knowledge and practices, and kitchen staff working less than 12 hours per shift scored significantly higher in terms of sanitation knowledge than those who worked more hours per shift. Also, kitchen staff working in restaurant franchises showed higher levels of both knowledge and practice than those working in independent restaurants. Research limitations/implications - A more diversified sanitation-training program should be developed on the basis of the characteristics of kitchen staff members and restaurant characteristics. As kitchen staff members themselves have identified change in perspectives on sanitation as the most important factor for improving practice levels, the training should not only transmit information but should be developed into a training method. Originality/value - This research provides suggestions for how restaurant kitchens in South Korea can make progress in a situation where sanitation implementation is limited to the transfer of knowledge.","[Jeon, Min-Sun] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Taejon, South Korea; [Park, Su-Jin; Hong, Wan-soo] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Foodserv Management & Nutr, Seoul, South Korea; [Jang, Hye-Ja] Dankook Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Cheanan, South Korea; [Choi, Young-Sim] Suwon Womens Coll, Dept Food & Culinary Arts, Kyonggi Do, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Sangmyung University; Dankook University,"Hong, WS (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Dept Foodserv Management & Nutr, Seoul, South Korea.",wshong@smu.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,6,8,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to help food technologists face this challenge and be competent members of a multidisciplinary team, a study module on the investigation of a real-life food-borne outbreak was developed. Design/methodology/approach - The module design was based on the principles of inquiry-based learning with the purpose to motivate and activate students with challenging assignments. The didactic impact of the module was evaluated as a qualitative case study with questionnaires, reflection assignments and interviews of students and lecturers. Findings - A teaching module developed by an external professional taking part in the academic environment provides a learning environment well adapted to the curriculum, as well as bringing first-hand realism and enthusiasm into the classroom. The external lecturer's dedication to the subject was appreciated by the students. A majority of the students believed that the outbreak investigation simulation play gave a better understanding of how food-borne outbreaks are investigated. A majority of the students 68 per cent (2011) and 82 per cent (2012) believed that what they learned in this module would be useful in a future work situation. Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations to the study, the most important one being the small sample size, and as the classes rarely exceeds 30 students, the use of a control group was not logistically feasible. Originality/value - Teaching food technologists to become knowledgeable professionals in this field will constitute a valuable contribution to the multidisciplinary food-borne outbreak investigation team. In turn, this may increase confidence among the general public in the food industry.","[Karlsen, Hanne; Mehli, Lisbeth] Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Dept Food Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Wahl, Erik] Norwegian Food Safety Author, Dist Off Trondheim & Orkdal, Trondheim, Norway; [Staberg, Ragnhild Lyngved] Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Fac Teacher & Interpreter Educ, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Karlsen, H (通讯作者)，Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Dept Food Technol, Trondheim, Norway.",hanne.karlsen@hist.no,,"Mehli, Lisbeth/0000-0002-1106-3512; Staberg, Ragnhild Lyngved/0000-0001-6621-208X","Research council of Norway, regional funding VRI Trondelag [MOB09017]; Sor-Trondelag University College","Research council of Norway, regional funding VRI Trondelag(Research Council of Norway); Sor-Trondelag University College","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from The Research council of Norway, regional funding VRI Trondelag (project number MOB09017) and financial support from Sor-Trondelag University College.",,31,5,5,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Outcomes refer to the impacts of the firm on the natural environment, while processes are the firm's actions to reduce these outcomes. We focus on a specific outcome - carbon emissions - and suggest that it affects Tobin's q non-linearly. We find that firms achieve the highest financial performance when their carbon performance is neither low nor high, but intermediate. We also find that environmental processes moderate this relationship as they reinforce firms' financial performance through improved stakeholder management. This mixed picture suggests that firms do not generally internalize the costs of poor carbon performance, but those that stand out in both environmental outcomes and processes achieve net financial benefits. These findings are based on a sample of carbon-intensive firms that disclosed their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Carbon Disclosure Project from 2007 through 2013. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Considered aspects are: first, the organizational practices adopted along the chain to assure effective segregation; second, the changes in the characteristics and governance of the key transaction (meat processor-retailer); finally, what makes the chain economically sustainable. Design/methodology/approach - A picture of the chain is obtained collecting information from the businesses involved; the snowball selection criterion is used in identifying people to interview. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) is used to conceptualize the organizational changes in the meat processor-retailer transaction; the coherence of expected-actual variations in asset specificity, uncertainty and frequency, as well as of the observed governance with TCE predictions is assessed. Findings - The creation of the non-GM chain required investments by both the key actors involved and the establishment of a partnership based on trust and mutual dependence. The increase in uncertainty coupled with the rise in asset specificity led to higher transaction costs, requiring a shift of the governance structure toward the right side of the market-hierarchy continuum to economize on costs and improve supply chain performance. TCE well explains the changes occurred. The retailer values the return on image as a strategic asset and bears the non-GM extra costs making the chain economically sustainable. Research limitations/implications - The implications of the findings are twofold. First, they help to identify the critical factors for an effective and economically sustainable segregation of non-GM products/raw materials along agro-food value chains. Second, they show how chain actors could adopt tighter governance structures in order to comply with binding technical and quality specifications, economize on transaction costs and improve supply chain performance. Originality/value - Retailer-led private standards used as regulation and enforcement mechanisms in vertical relations, as well as their organizational implications in the governance of transactions between actors in agro-food value chains have received insufficient attention. This research contributes to fill out this gap.","[Passuello, Francesca; Soregaroli, Claudio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, SMEA Grad Sch Agrofood Econ & Management, Cremona, Italy; [Boccaletti, Stefano] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Agrifood Econ, Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Boccaletti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Agrifood Econ, Piacenza, Italy.",stefano.boccaletti@unicatt.it,"SOREGAROLI, Claudio/AAB-3263-2021; Soregaroli, Claudio/JGL-9826-2023; Boccaletti, Stefano/U-7603-2019","SOREGAROLI, Claudio/0000-0003-0903-6352; Boccaletti, Stefano/0000-0002-5758-7012; BOCCALETTI, Stefano/0000-0003-0653-5017","European Union [289,157]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement No. 289,157.

Design/methodology/approach - Using data from an in-person field survey, a TwoStep cluster analysis was employed in order to detect perceived differences among consumers with different profiles. Findings - The analysis identified two distinct consumer groups differentiated primarily by income: the low-potential aquaculture consumers and the high-potential aquaculture consumers, representing 67 and 33 per cent of the total sample, respectively. The study provides evidence that there is a lesser preference towards farmed fish. Therefore, more efficient marketing strategies are probably needed in order to promote awareness in aquaculture consumption, and potentially contribute in guiltlessness of the whole sector.

Yet only a few miles to the south is another district centered at Wall Street. This paper aims to investigate when and why midtown emerged as a separate business district. We have created a new data set from historical New York City directories that provide the employment location, residence, and job type for several thousand residents in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. We supplement this data with additional records from historical business directories. The evidence suggests that early midtown firms appeared there in order to be closer to local residential customers who had been moving north on the island throughout the 19th century. Once several industries appeared in midtown, it triggered a spatial equilibrium readjustment in the 1880s, which then promoted the rise of skyscrapers in midtown around the turn of the 20th century. This process occurred several years before the opening of Grand Central Station in 1913.","[Barr, Jason] Rutgers Univ Newark, Dept Econ, 360 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,Hill Hall, Newark, NJ 01702 USA; [Tassier, Troy] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Dealy Hall,441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Fordham University,"Barr, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers Univ Newark, Dept Econ, 360 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,Hill Hall, Newark, NJ 01702 USA.",jmbarr@rutgers.edu; tassier@fordham.edu,,,Rutgers University Research Council Grant,Rutgers University Research Council Grant,"Earlier versions of this research were presented at New York University, Binghamton University, and the 2012 Eastern Economics Association Meetings.

In concept water quality trading programs can create incentives for agricultural operators to supply low cost pollutant reductions while still keeping land in agricultural production. In practice water quality trading programs in the United States have produced few trades involving agricultural NPS. Transactions costs are a critical, but poorly understood, feature of water quality trading programs. The objective of this study is to examine the transactions costs associated with expanding the use of NPS credits in a water quality trading program in Virginia (United States) to include credits generated from agricultural working lands best management practices (BMPs). Findings indicate that transactions costs for agricultural NPS trades in Virginia are currently relatively low, due to the activity being credited: simple land conversion. Based on best available evidence, transactions costs of creating credits using management and structural BMPs will be 2 to 16 times more costly on a per project basis than for land conversion credits. Compliance monitoring protocols are a significant driver of costs for working lands credits. Our results suggest an important cost/risk tradeoff between verification costs and compliance certainty for program designers to consider. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Flooding, in particular, is one of the most damaging natural disasters globally and is projected to increase in many regions. However, estimating the value of green infrastructure in mitigating downstream floods remains a challenge. We estimate the economic value of flood mitigation by the Otter Creek floodplains and wetlands to Middlebury, VT, for Tropical Storm Irene and nine other floods. We used first principles to simulate hydrographs for scenarios with and without flood mitigation by upstream wetlands and floodplains. We then mapped flood extents for each scenario and calculated monetary damages to inundated structures. Our analysis indicates damage reductions of 84-95% for Tropical Storm Irene and 54-78% averaged across all 10 events. We estimate that the annual value of flood mitigation services provided to Middlebury, VT, exceeds $126,000 and may be as high as $450,000. Economic impacts of this magnitude stress the importance of floodplain and wetland conservation, warrant the consideration of ecosystem services in land use decisions, and make a compelling case for the role of green infrastructure in building resilience to climate change.

These models descriptively explain the feedbacks between socio-economic development and natural disasters such as floods. Complementary to these descriptive models, we develop a dynamic optimization model, where the inter-temporal decision of an economic agent interacts with the hydrological system. We assume a standard macro-economic growth model where agents derive utility from consumption and output depends on physical capital that can be accumulated through investment. To this framework we add the occurrence of flooding events which will destroy part of the capital. We identify two specific periodic long term solutions and denote them rich and poor economies. Whereas rich economies can afford to invest in flood defense and therefore avoid flood damage and develop high living standards, poor economies prefer consumption instead of investing in flood defense capital and end up facing flood damages every time the water level rises like e.g. the Mekong delta. Nevertheless, they manage to sustain at least a low level of physical capital. We identify optimal investment strategies and compare simulations with more frequent, more intense and stochastic high water level events. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We advocate a modeling strategy where improvements in technical efficiency capture technology spillovers as industries absorb and implement the best-practice technology. Dynamic panel-based techniques are used to determine whether efficiency series move together in the long run (cointegrate) and/or move closer together over time (converge). We control for technological heterogeneity and for cross-sectional dependence in the data. For a panel of manufacturing industries in six EU countries, we find evidence of technology spillovers and convergence among industries' efficiency levels across countries and mainly across adjacent technology regimes.","[Bos, Jaap W.

Participants (N = 252, mean(age) = 44.35, SD = 15.29, 97% resided in Australia) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: (1) organic identity prime, (2) pro-environmental identity prime, and (3) neither pro-environmental nor organic identity primes (control). Analysis of variance revealed that organic identity prime was associated with significant increase in intentions to purchase organic products, relative to both pro-environmental identity and control conditions. Follow-up mediation analysis indicated that organic self-identity increased consumer intentions by influencing their attitudes and group norms. These results demonstrate that organic identity can be primed to create identity-congruent shifts toward organic consumerism. Importantly, these findings have direct application for marketing strategies aiming at promoting and developing an organic brand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While prior work has identified increases in the utilization of analgesics due to the introduction of Medicare Part D, the extent to which this increase in drug use actually improved the well-being of older adults is not known. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy that compares pre versus post 2006 changes in pain related outcomes between Medicare eligible persons and a younger ineligible group.

By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and 'less-developed' countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir, mainly in the global South, and degrowth, mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.","[McAfee, Kathleen] San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"McAfee, K (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",kmcafee@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,123,61,65,7,148,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While there is not much debate about the positive contribution of migration and local off-farm employment to China's economy, there is increasing concern about the potential negative effects of moving labor away from agriculture on China's future food security. This is a critical issue as maintaining self-sufficiency in grain production will be critical for China to feed its huge population in the future. Several papers have studied the impact of migration on production and have yielded ambiguous results. But the impact of migration on technical efficiency is rarely studied. Methodologically, we incorporate the correlated random-effects approach into the inefficiency analysis of the standard stochastic production frontier model to control for unobservable factors that are correlated with migration and off-farm employment decisions and technical efficiency. The most consistent result that emerged from our econometric analysis is that neither migration nor local off-farm employment has a negative effect on the technical efficiency of grain production, which does not support the widespread notion that vast-scale labor migration could negatively affect China's future food security.","[Yang, Jin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jin, Songqing] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jin, Songqing] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kevin] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing Off, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Riedinger, Jeffrey] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Peng, Chao] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Central University of Finance & Economics; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Nokia Corporation; Pfizer; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Jin, SQ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Jin, SQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jins@msu.edu,"Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022; Covey, Kevin/AAE-3599-2020; Jin, Songqing/W-4340-2019","Covey, Kevin/0000-0001-6914-7797; Jin, Songqing/0000-0001-8514-7930","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets led by IFPRI; National Social Science Fund of China [13CGL085]; Michigan State University's Competitive Discretionary Fund Program [09-CDFP-1965]; Office of the Provost and AgbioResearch; [NSFC71361140370]","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets led by IFPRI; National Social Science Fund of China; Michigan State University's Competitive Discretionary Fund Program; Office of the Provost and AgbioResearch;","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from NSFC71361140370, the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets led by IFPRI, and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 13CGL085).

We use a new dataset of monthly quoted stock prices and dividends of international companies at the Brussels stock exchange to estimate the returns to investment in tropical agriculture (1919-1938). We adopt the Dimson-March-Staunton method to compute real geometric annual average rates of return and assess our estimates in an international comparative perspective. We find that returns to colonial FDI in the Netherlands Indies during 1919-1928 were impressive (14.3 %), being almost 3 percentage points higher than the world average. In the following decade 1929-1938 fortunes reversed, with a rate of return of -2.8 % compared to a world average of 2.2 %. Over the entire period the returns to colonial FDI (5.4 % in 1919-1938) were about a factor 2.5 higher than returns to investment in the Dutch domestic economy (2.1 % in 1920-1939). We argue that these returns should be interpreted in a colonial context of systematic labour repression, but that they may also partly reflect a higher risk-premium of investments in colonial commodities.","[Buelens, Frans] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Frankema, Ewout] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; Wageningen University & Research,"Frankema, E (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",ewout.frankema@wur.nl,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023; frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015",,,,,,92,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2016,10.0,2,,,,,197.0,224.0,,10.1007/s11698-015-0128-z,0.0,,,28,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DK1IY,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374666900004,0

Focusing on the Spanish case, this article reviews the literature and provides an overall assessment of this historical process based on recent research. Common lands appear to have been reasonably well managed and their dismantling did not foster agricultural productivity. Instead, the privatisation process negatively affected the economic situation of a large proportion of rural households and local councils, as well as deteriorating the stock of social capital. Therefore, the long-standing belief in the existence of a trade-off between equity and efficiency actually turns out to be misleading.","[Tapia, Francisco J.

Depending on the sturdiness of farms already producing, such a shift in the industry may affect production costs of exclusively using organic fry for production. If the profitability of the primary organic aquaculture producers should be maintained, then farmers must be able to correspondingly receive higher prices, transmitted through the value chain from the retail market. This study identifies the price premium for organic salmon in Danish retail sale using consumer panel scanner data from households by applying a random effect hedonic price model that permits unobserved household heterogeneity. A price premium of 20% was identified for organic salmon. The magnitude of this premium is comparable to organic labeled agricultural products and higher than that of eco-labeled capture fishery products, such as the Marine Stewardship Council. This indicates that the organic label also used for agricultural products may be better known and trusted among consumers than the eco-labels on capture fishery products. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Metals are strategically important resources for industrialized and industrializing societies. In 2010, the five BRICS countries (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) consumed 54% of the metals mined globally. The analysis of material flow data offers a biophysical perspective on mining as a resource frontier and allows for the identification of patterns in global metals extraction and trade. Since 1950, metal extraction has shifted from the early industrializing countries into the emerging economies. In 2010, only 6% of metals mined stemmed from Europe or North America while 76% were extracted in four countries (Australia, China, India, and Brazil). In the countries hosting large-scale mining operations, socio-ecological pressure ensues the so-called extractivist development path is common. High rates of metal deposit depletion mean that today's metal extractors and exporters may depend on imports of metal from anthropogenic deposits (stocks in buildings, infrastructure, and durable products) in the future. The extractivist path and the shifting of metals from natural to anthropogenic deposits are both associated with potential for conflict. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The growing role played by developing countries in negotiations is one of the main causes behind the deadlock. Further attention should therefore be paid to the composition of the alliances formed by developing countries in order to better understand the key structural features driving their bargaining positions. By applying a cluster analysis, this paper aims to investigate the role played by heterogeneity in specific characteristics of developing countries in explaining divergent costs and benefits associated with alternative climate negotiation outcomes.

Construal-level theory was used as a theoretical framework to interpret the associations. In addition, consumer groups were compared on psychological distance, values, age, and gender. Design/methodology/approach - Two studies were performed. In Study 1, a sample of 154 participants filled out the words that came to their mind when thinking of organic food, organic meat or organic vegetables, and psychological distance and values were measured. In Study 2 these words were rated on centrality by an independent sample (n = 52). Findings - Consumers think of animal welfare, price, health, pesticides, and naturalness the most when thinking of organic. The environment, health, honesty, pesticides, sustainability, quality, natural, additives, origin, certification, and taste were central across organic food, organic meat, and organic vegetables. Thinking of organic meat showed consumers' concern for animal welfare, while thinking of organic vegetables showed concern for human health. Consumer groups differed regarding psychological distance, values, gender, and age. Consumers who frequently bought organic food were more positive about organic food products compared to consumers who occasionally or hardly ever bought organic food products. Originality/value - This research extends the scope of current consumer research about organic food and provides new insight in the word associations consumers have with organic food products.","[Hilverda, Femke; Jurgens, Manon; Kuttschreuter, Margot] Univ Twente, Dept Psychol Conflict Risk & Safety, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Hilverda, F (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Psychol Conflict Risk & Safety, Enschede, Netherlands.",m.d.hilverda@utwente.nl,"Kuttschreuter, Margot/C-3084-2013; Morscher, Sophie/AFU-6557-2022","Hilverda, Femke/0000-0002-7542-4508; Kuttschreuter, Margot; Margot; M.; M.W.M.;/0000-0003-1108-9832",,,,,23,11,12,3,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the hot points for local governments has been finding ways to attract people and promote development of rural territories for the past decades. Both theoretical and practical solutions for maintaining rural society and promoting renewal of society are the development of cultural environment. Cultural activities directly affect public participation, cooperation among the population, the development of creativity, and promotion of inclusive society, health and society renewal. As recent investigations show, cultural environment is broadly developing in rural territories of Latvia. The research of cultural environment as a potential for the renewal of society of Latvia is a novelty due to the beginning of the National Research Programme for the period 2014-2017 funded by the Government of Latvia (EKOSOC LV projects 5.2.4., 5.2.8.). The aim of the article is to analyze cultural environment as a potential for renewal of society in rural territories of Latvia. The research object is planning and development documents of local governments, different agents of rural territories. The research questions are the following: How do local governments link development of cultural environment to settlement patterns, population attraction, place development and renewal of society? How are these links reflected in planning and development documents of local governments and in point of view of different social agents in rural territories? The results of the study reveal development of cultural environment in rural territories in Latvia. However, these practices are fragile yet and need support. They can bring forth new social and economic structures and serve as promoters of smart development of rural territories in Latvia. For this reason, local governments should create their own strategies in order to appreciate and support cultural activities as their potential for renewal of rural society.","[Kruzmetra, Zenija; Bite, Dina; Kronberga, Ginta] Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Kruzmetra, Z (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Zenija.Kruzmetra@llu.lv,"Bite, Dina/AAG-3835-2019","Bite, Dina/0000-0003-1589-3676",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,57.0,64.0,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200006,0

In 2012, in fact, the analyzed area showed an inequality index for disposable income of 6.3, and a relative poverty risk index of 42.3. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In order to get deeper insights into consumers' wasting behaviors, a survey on food waste generation in households was carried out in a province of Sicily (Italy). The questionnaire has been formulated taking into account the socio-demographic characteristics for the person who, in the family, usually makes the expenditure, in particular: gender, age, marital status, number of household members, education level, type (single, with or without children, married with or without children), worker and/or student if responsible for food shopping, the number of monthly meals, the kind of ready meal eaten (frozen, fresh, canned or freeze-dried), net monthly income for the family, etc. (adapted by Bae et al., 2010). The data collected from the statistical return of the consumers were drawn up to transform the same data into information of simpler and more concise interpretation. Findings - The results of the survey are presented in this paper. They can help understand the reasons for discarding edible food and to identify the food groups that are most wasted. Research limitations/implications - The analysis of a larger land area or community allows most relevant conclusions. The research has an exploratory perspective since the sample strategy is not probabilistic. Social implications - The findings could be susceptible to support practical and social implications for the identification of measures and instruments aimed at reducing food waste and at increasing consumers' awareness on that issue. Originality/value - The study can stimulate sustainable consumption and consumer behavior especially in light of the current economic crisis.","[Lanfranchi, Maurizio; Calabro, Grazia; De Pascale, Angelina; Fazio, Alessandro; Giannetto, Carlo] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Lanfranchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy.",mlanfranchi@unime.it,,"De Pascale, Angelina/0000-0002-7550-9798; GIANNETTO, Carlo/0000-0002-6348-3164",,,,,52,63,66,8,90,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In all, 322 ready-to-eat food samples categorized into 17 types were collected from nine Korean amusement parks and their fat, saturated fatty acid and trans fatty acid contents were assessed. Findings - Fat, saturated fatty acid and trans fatty acid contents were relatively high in flour-based products. On the basis of the Korea Food and Drug Administration classification, the samples in 12 categories were classified as high-fat foods. The samples in nine categories were classified as high-saturated fatty acid foods. Most samples also contained non-negligible levels of trans fatty acids. The fat, saturated fatty acid and trans fatty acid contents of samples even in the same category varied markedly. Social implications - This research will inform the necessity of an appropriate safety management system for ready-to-eat foods distributed at amusement. Originality/value - Although the fat contents of foods distributed around school area were often observed, the potential risk of those in ready-to-eat foods distributed at amusement parks have rarely been assessed.

As to the continuous sales period, we combine robust optimization with Bayesian updating to revise the probability distribution of the demand further.","[Li, Chenlu] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,"Li, CL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",250840276@qq.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,7,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,272.0,276.0,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200049,0

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the integration of short messaging service (SMS) in experimental auctions. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a case study on iodine biofortified food with 180 household decision makers in Africa, a standard Becker-Degroot-Marschak procedure was compared with the novel SMS-based procedure through five information/auction rounds. Thereby, a standard protocol commonly employed in validation of medical diagnostic tests was adopted, assessing the sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and post-test probability. Findings - The SMS-based elicitation exhibited high levels of sensitivity (89-95 per cent), specificity (63-73 per cent), precision (40-60 per cent), NPV (92-98 per cent), LR+(2.6-3.3) and LR-(0.08-0.2) for all the auction rounds. The post-test plot indicates that the novel procedure is particularly consistent in ascertaining positive and negative valuations for a new food product. Originality/value - Even though SMS-based bidding is shown to be an accurate, but also convenient and attractive bidding procedure, which is in line with novel ways of purchasing food, further validation is inevitable to determine its reliability in different contexts and its most effective use.

The purpose of this paper is to present an approach at finding out the possibilities of estimating the business potential of a business idea in advance. Design/methodology/approach - In the approach, a model is built based on two data sources. Statistical data on the food expenditure of households and average division of the revenues and margins of the local food supply chain are divided to production, intermediate level (wholesales/distribution) and retailing stages. To estimate the regional local food business potential as a whole, the market share estimations have been made by local food experts. Findings - The approach was tested and utilized in evaluating the feasibility of a local food wholesale business in South-East Finland. It produced a credible overview of the business potential and pinpointed the challenges of the local food wholesales. The study indicated also that expressing the feasibility in terms of the required market share for employee count is an easy-to-understand way to depict the feasibility of a business. Research limitations/implications - The model gives indicative, industry average-based results: the results of the model should be refined with analyses on the particular business model, especially its cost efficiency and other competitive parameters compared to more traditional way of doing business. Practical implications - The model helps local food entrepreneurs and firms as well as their financiers to get a realistic picture of the business potential and the economic feasibility of the targeted business. Originality/value - The study introduces a novel approach combining quantitative data and expert evaluation for evaluating the market potential and economic prerequisites of a regional food supply chain operator.","[Niemi, Petri; Pekkanen, Petra] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Niemi, P (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland.",petri.niemi@lut.fi,"Niemi, Petri I.

Design/methodology/approach - In two studies, the authors examined the predictive and incremental validity of these two types of attitudinal measures of eating behavior. Implicit attitudes were assessed with a standard implicit attitude test procedure (target categories were sweets and fruit, and attribute categories were good and bad); two explicit attitude measures were assessed: an explicit measure of preference for sweets over fruit and a semantic differential measure. The behavioral measure in Study 1 was the quantity of sweets consumed; in Study 2, it was a relative measure of sweets vs fruit consumption registered through a three-day diary. Findings - The relatively low correlation between implicit and explicit attitude measures indicated that these measures at least partially tap into different processes. Implicit attitudes proved to be superior over explicit attitudes in predicting food consumption, especially for consumption registered via diary. This fact suggests that implicit attitudes are powerful drivers of long-term behavior. Practical implications - The findings could be useful in tailoring interventions to promote healthier eating habits. Originality/value - The research tested predictive power of implicit food-related attitudes. It compared the food consumption in laboratory and real-life settings. A new measure for daily food consumption was developed and it was calculated relative to recommended serving size.","[Pavlovic, Masa; Zezelj, Iris; Marinkovic, Masa] Univ Belgrade, Dept Psychol, Belgrade, Serbia; [Sucevic, Jelena] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England",University of Belgrade; University of Oxford,"Zezelj, I (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Dept Psychol, Belgrade, Serbia.",izezelj@f.bg.ac.rs,"Žeželj, Iris/H-9339-2019","Žeželj, Iris/0000-0002-9527-1406",,,,,44,4,4,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The focus of our study is on a 40,466 ha mangrove forest in Malaysia known as the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve. The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve has been used for charcoal and pole production for over 100 years and is often described as a good example of a sustainably managed multi-use mangrove forest. However, recent research shows that the health of various components of the ecosystem is in decline (notably some bird species and the blood cockle fishery). We use opportunity cost analysis to determine that the minimum compensation required to offset the production revenue currently derived from timber production in the forest is less than US$0.83 tCO2e. At these relatively low costs we demonstrate that REDD + is financially viable to be strategically used to support the conservation of some parts of the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve which could result in better sustainable outcomes for the forest area and its stakeholders as a whole.

Using information from interviews (n = 1133) in seven sites in the Iberian Peninsula and one in the Balearic Islands, we 1) identify current trends in the consumption and gathering of wild edible plants (n = 56 plant-uses) and 2) analyze how cultural ecosystem services relate to such trends. Our data show a generalized decrease in the consumption and gathering of wild edible plants, although the trend changes significantly across plant-uses. Specifically, we found that -despite the overall decreasing trend- uses of wild edible plants that simultaneously relate to foods with high cultural appreciation and the recreational function of gathering remain popular. Our results signal that cultural services and values associated to the gathering and consumption of some wild edible plants are important factors explaining divergent trends across plant species. This finding reinforces the notion that cultural ecosystem services are deeply intertwined with other categories of services which can combine in complex, non-linear ways producing a variety of interdependent benefits.

When workers' marginal willingness to pay for housing and their productivity are positively correlated, there is no core-periphery equilibrium.

Using nationally representative data collected in 2009/2010 in Uganda, an endogenous switching regression model estimates the net economic and environmental effects of switching from local landraces to modem species. Results show that, after controlling for market and agro-ecological factors, the local varieties perform better than modem ones in marginalized and climatic vulnerable areas. Crop biodiversity shows to play a fundamental role in farmers' risk minimizing strategies when the available modern varieties are not adaptable to the local context and not supported by the required level of agro-intensification. Rural development policies should consider the heterogeneity in the adoption returns and support diversity conservation as a national strategic asset for a suitable bioprospecting and a best-fitting agricultural system implementation.

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for analyzing mineral extraction which links the use and management of natural resources by means of the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model developed by Georgescu-Roegen. Mining is a productive process that not only depletes minerals ores but also affects other natural resources that are needed to maintain life-supporting processes over time. The central claim is the need of recognizing the existence of biophysical limits to extraction in order to manage natural resources as irreplaceable providers of ecosystem services. By providing a new conceptualization for operationalizing the ecosystem services approach based on the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model, we intend to challenge the current extractivist narrative that assumes unregulated practices, monetary indicators, technological advancements and substitutable resources. We argue that limits to mining activities should depend on a biophysical evaluation of the effects of these activities on the environment. Furthermore, social deliberation is required to determine whether extraction should occur and to what extent it is socially acceptable while still maintaining the integrity of socio-ecological systems.

The main objective of the paper is to gain an understanding of the support mechanism of renewable energy sources most preferred by households in the United Kingdom. This paper analyses households' preferences and willingness to pay under a mandatory scheme where all households contribute compared to a voluntary scheme where only those who wish to pay to support renewables do so (such as the green tariffs offered by electricity suppliers in the UK). Two contingent valuation method (CVM) surveys are used to explore whether the type of payment option has an impact on households' willingness to pay (WTP) for increasing share of renewable energy in electricity generation. The paper also investigates whether the type of payment mode affects respondents' self-reported certainty of paying their stated valuations. The results indicate that the likelihood of paying a positive amount for supporting renewable energy is higher under a mandatory scheme compared to a voluntary payment option in the UK. Respondents have a higher level of certainty in paying their stated WTP under a mandatory payment scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We discuss the influence of these safety-improving technologies as well as government regulations on different kinds of fatal accident rates.

Pollution therefore affects efficiency and the TFP growth decomposition. As an alternative approach we draw on theoretical studies from the environmental economics literature, which demonstrate that TFP affects environmental quality. Along these lines we adopt a two-stage empirical methodology. Firstly, we obtain two estimates of productive performance (efficiency and TFP growth) using a stochastic production frontier framework in Stage 1 for European countries (1995-2008), from which we omit emissions. Secondly, in Stage 2 these measures of productive performance are used as regressors in spatial models of per capita nitrogen and sulphur emissions for European countries. From our preferred Stage 2 spatial models we find that a country's TFP growth must fall to reduce its per capita nitrogen and sulphur emissions. This is likely to be because nitrogen and sulphur emissions in the EU have been tightly regulated for a long period of time via air quality standards and consequently, substantial reductions in emissions from cleaner and more productive technology were achieved some time ago.","[Adetutu, Morakinyo; Glass, Anthony J.; Kenjegalieva, Karligash] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Loughborough University; Rice University,"Sickles, RC (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",M.O.Adetutu@lboro.ac.uk; A.J.Glass@lboro.ac.uk; K.A.Kenjegalieva@lboro.ac.uk; rsickles@rice.edu,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,62,39,40,0,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Plans to introduce these incentives by allowing competition among risk bearing LTC insurers are likely to jeopardize universal access. Combining universal access and competition among risk bearing LTC-insurers requires an adequate system of risk adjustment. While risk adjustment is now widely adopted in health insurance, LTC-specific features cause uncertainty about the feasibility of risk adjustment for LTC insurance. We examine the feasibility of appropriate risk adjustment in LTC insurance by using a rich set of linked nationwide Dutch administrative data. As expected, prior LTC use and demographic information are found to explain much of the variation in individual LTC expenses. However, we find that prior health care expenditures are also important in reducing predicted losses for subgroups of health care users. Nevertheless, incentives for risk selection against some easily identifiable subgroups persist. Moreover, using prior utilization and expenditure as risk adjusters reduces incentives for efficiency, creating a trade-off between equity and efficiency. To ease this trade-off, data on individuals' underlying needs for LTC are required.","[Bakx, Pieter; Schut, Frederik; van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] Tinbergen Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Bakx, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bakx@bmg.eur.nl,"; Schut, Frederik/D-2823-2013","van Doorslaer, Eddy/0000-0003-2692-1433; Bakx, Pieter/0000-0001-7749-3091; Schut, Frederik/0000-0002-5748-5403",,,,,39,3,3,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

In the present paper, we examine how action and result-oriented agricultural policy measures affect the species protection initiatives of real agricultural managers. To do so, we use a computer-based economic experiment involving a multi-period individual business, simulation game. Our results indicate that action-oriented measures do not have any impacts on farmers' initiatives to protect species. In contrast to action-oriented policy measures, result-oriented measures with identical profit effect significantly increase these initiatives. Although risk-averse farmers are less willing to participate in result-oriented measures than non-risk-averse farmers, in general, risk aversion does not influence farmers' species protection initiatives. Furthermore, the species protection initiatives are influenced by the opportunity costs of species protection. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Emphasis has been put on individual utility and rational choice, which does not adequately capture the full spectrum of social values of ecosystem services. A socio-cultural approach to value ecosystem services is increasingly advocated and is gaining more attention in the ecosystem service research agenda. The current documentation of socio-cultural perspectives on ecosystem services is, however, characterized by a conflation of the concepts of cultural ecosystem services and socio-cultural values of ecosystem services. This paper reviews (i) the concept of socio-cultural values within the ecosystem service framework, (ii) the social and ecological factors that determine socio-cultural values, and (iii) the methods by which socio-cultural values can be assessed. The clarifications of the concept of socio-cultural valuation and the structured listing of the available methods facilitate a better integration of socio-cultural values into ecosystem service assessments and help researchers to choose methods from the available portfolio.

This paper examines some of Ostrom's 'situational variables' for the analysis of institutional choice in common-pool resources, as they relate to the Gnangara case. The institutional analysis identifies elements of the current governance institutions that could be altered to facilitate collective action. We use data from a set of water licensing documents obtained from the state's Department of Water. A number of factors are identified as inhibiting the potential for collective action. Current arrangements are top-down in nature, with all rules, monitoring, and any enforcement supplied by the state-level management agency. Norms and expectations among appropriators appear to be competitive rather than co-operative, and discount rates appear to be high. Monitoring and enforcement are under-supplied, and opportunistic behaviour affects compliance. The interactions between user and regulator influence the appropriation of flows, and have resulting impacts on the resource stock. We conclude that several factors in this case prejudice the development of collective action institutions by appropriator efforts alone. The study highlights important aspects of the institutional arrangements in place, and their likely effects upon the attitudes and behaviours of appropriators who, along with wildlife and ecosystems, depend on the common-pool resource.

Findings indicate social capital, education, societal openness, urbanization, and ethnicities are significantly associated with ICT utilization. We suggest important implications for policymakers at state and federal levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nominal wages tended to be higher where higher prices prevailed, and vice versa. Prices and nominal wages remained highest in Japan and lowest in Manchuria, with Korea and Taiwan being placed in between. Welfare ratios remained roughly comparable in the 1910s in the imperial cities outside Manchuria, where unskilled workers enjoyed substantially higher living standards. Interwar decades saw real wages rise in Tokyo, but fall in Dalian, which caused convergence in workers' income levels. Wage divergence occurred within Manchuria, as workers in Shenyang and Changchun enjoyed an improving welfare ratio. Real wages rose more slowly in Korean and Taiwanese than in Japanese cities. Replacing a subsistence lifestyle with a respectable' lifestyle yields a significantly different picture of the evolution of the real wage gap within the empire, which contradicts findings reported by existing studies in important respects.","Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Cha, MS (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea.",,,,,,,,72,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This paper uses data from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) to address three areas of particular concern: the prevalence of growing your own food and how this has changed over time; the individual and household context in which growing takes place; and whether those who grow their own food are happier than those who do not. Results showed that there was a marked increase in growing your own food in Europe, in the period 2003-2007. This increase is largely associated with poorer households and thus, possibly, economic hardship. In the UK however the increase in growing your own food is predominantly associated with older middle class households. Across Europe, whether causal or not, those who grew their own were happier than those who did not. The paper therefore concludes that claims about the gentrification of growing your own may be premature. Despite contrary evidence from the UK, the dominant motive across Europe appears to be primarily economic - to reduce household expenditure whilst ensuring a supply of fresh food.

By contrast, Sweden's regional inequality dropped from 1860 to 1980 and did not exhibit this U-shaped pattern. Accordingly, today's regional income inequality in Sweden is lower than in other European countries. We note that the prime mover behind the long-run reduction in regional income differentials was structural change, whereas neoclassical and technological forces played a relatively less important role. However, this process of regional income convergence can be divided into three major periods. During the first period (1860-1940), the unrestricted action of market forces, particularly the expansion of markets and high rates of internal and international migration, led to the compression of regional income differentials. During the next period (1940-80), regional convergence was even more intense. In this period, institutional arrangements favoured the reduction of productivity differentials across industries and successive governments aided the reallocation of the workforce from declining to thriving regions and economic sectors. During the last period (1980-2000), when regional incomes diverged, internal migration and structural change slowed. Furthermore, the development of knowledge-intensive service industries favoured economic growth in the main metropolitan areas.","[Enflo, Kerstin] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Roses, Joan Ramon] London Sch Econ, London, England",Lund University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Enflo, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,"Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013","Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134; Enflo, Kerstin/0000-0002-9904-8957",,,,,83,36,38,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

J,"Galvin, R",,,,"Galvin, Ray",,,'Constant' rebound effects in domestic heating: Developing a cross-sectional method,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound effect; Thermal retrofits; Energy efficiency elasticity; Energy policy,ENERGY EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT,"Policymakers are increasingly concerned about rebound effects, which lead to lower savings than expected when energy-efficiency increases. There are difficulties in making coherent comparisons between magnitudes of rebound effects in different sectors, such as home heating, industry and transport. A barrier to this in domestic heating is the conceptual difficulty of estimating rebound effects as energy-efficiency elasticities, since the large, stepwise increases in energy-efficiency through thermal retrofits fit uneasily with differential calculus. This paper offers a solution. Firstly, it develops a 'cross-sectional' method in which elasticity-based rebound formulae are used to estimate implied average rebound effects in large datasets of energy consumption and energy efficiency. It then shows how a simple power curve can model these datasets, simplifying the mathematics, giving 'constant' rebound effect results that are immediately meaningful, and extending compatibility to rebound effect modelling in other sectors. The method is then extended to case studies of thermal retrofits of individual dwellings. Here the inherent inaccuracy of using linear approximations in rebound effect formulas is also illustrated. The cross-sectional, 'constant' rebound effect methodology is offered for wider use in estimating rebound effects in case studies and in domestic heating as more datasets of energy consumption and efficiency become available.

Design/methodology/approach - The survey was conducted with 365 people (around 50 persons for each region) who live in the different regions to represent the whole population of Turkey as good as possible. Questionnaire methodology was used to achieve the research objectives. Multiple-choice test which consists of 24 questions (Table I) were selected in order to keep the questionnaire at a reasonable length. Questionnaires were distributed to the respondents in small groups for effective communication. Multiple correspondence, decision tree and prospect profiles statistic procedures were used to identify the purchase behavior. Findings - In the study, some consumers worried that innovative packages might mislead them and therefore sales should be handled under trusted brands. Majority of consumers were willing to use innovative food packages to prevent the microbial spoilage. Consumers indicated that they do not want to see sachets in active food packages due to the probability of mistaken. Consumers who chose the price as a first thing to get their attention in food packaging, would accept the increase in price lesser than 10 percent after seeing the positive impacts of innovative packaging. Most of the consumers' (74.79 percent) expectation from innovative packaging was the visual ability to observe the history and freshness of foods inside the packaging. Participants indicated that education through commercials (40.55 percent) would be the most effective way in order to increase the overall acceptability for innovative packaging. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study was that, these questionnaires were applied only to Turkish consumers and findings might not be applicable to other countries. Practical implications - Better understanding of consumer adoption of innovative packages can help to minimize rejection of innovative technologies. Knowledge of consumer behaviors toward active and intelligent packaging can contribute to developing better industry strategies. Originality/value - This paper gives the detailed information about purchasing behavior of Turkish consumers' regarding innovative packaging techniques.","[Aday, Mehmet Seckin; Yener, Ugur] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Food Engn, Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Aday, MS (通讯作者)，Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Food Engn, Canakkale, Turkey.",mseckinaday@comu.edu.tr,"Yener, Ugur/JRX-3608-2023; Aday, Mehmet Seckin/A-1753-2013","Aday, Mehmet Seckin/0000-0002-5669-5812",,,,,41,40,43,3,71,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of the foodscape on fruit and vegetable choice by staff in a higher educational setting. Design/methodology/approach - Foodscape mapping of fruit and vegetable provision on campus was conducted to provide context. Two focus groups with staff and two interviews with foodservice managers took place to gain depth of understanding. Thematic analysis was conducted to allow for pattern and meaning to emerge. Findings - Results demonstrate two main overarching themes; personal influence and food operator influence that impact on fruit and vegetable choice. In addition connectivity, perceptions of freshness, food quality and display seemed to be strong categories emerging from the data. Interestingly, this research indicated that consumers were more likely to eat fruit and vegetables when part of a composite dish than if served separately. Practical implications - Providing a positive foodscape to enhance availability of fruit and vegetables may be challenging but helpful towards health promotion. Nevertheless, no nudging can control choice made by individuals, responsibility for healthy selection must always remain personal. Originality/value - Knowledge gained by this pilot study will add to the body of literature and evidence base for further research while contributing to foodservice strategies which may promote increased fruit and vegetable consumption.","[Bevan, Ann Lesley; Hemingway, Ann] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Care, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Hartwell, Heather] Bournemouth Univ, Food Serv & Appl Nutr Res Grp, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [da Costa Proenca, Rossana Pacheco] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Tourism, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [da Costa Proenca, Rossana Pacheco] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Nutr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Bournemouth University; Bournemouth University; Bournemouth University; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Proença, RPD (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Tourism, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.",rossana.costa@ufsc.br,"Hemingway, Ann/AAD-2512-2019; DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/U-4042-2019","Hemingway, Ann/0000-0002-0920-3897; DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/0000-0001-6149-8752",CAPES/Brazil (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior),CAPES/Brazil (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The authors acknowledge focus-group participants and the CAPES/Brazil (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) for its financial support as scholarship to R.P.C.P.,,29,8,11,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Particular emphasis is placed on the role of economic factors that may serve as a contextual factor influencing these relationships. Based on data from the Life in Transition Survey covering individuals from 35 countries in 2010, this study uses information regarding the financial crisis of 2008 to inform about economic factors. The results suggest that respondents exhibiting higher climate change concerns are not only more likely to intend to pay for mitigating the effects of climate change, but they are also more likely to take actions in order to minimize such effects. The results also indicate that economic factors only have a moderating effect on the relationship between higher climate change concerns and actions. Furthermore, the results also point to the relevance of a country's state of economic development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative data derived from a household budget survey (HBS) in Cyprus are used to set up questions to which answers are suggested using the qualitative approach of in-depth interviews. Findings - The main finding is that the relatively high expenditure by elderly couples on food for home consumption may be explained by frequent inter-household, intra-extended family meals in Cyprus. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides evidence that household expenditure on food may not be directly indicative of household consumption of food. Researchers interested in household consumption of food should therefore be aware of the differences between household and extended family and, where extended family continues to be significant, they should be wary of using data from HBSs to analyse food consumption. One limitation is that the results are derived from in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of nine households. It may be appropriate to replicate the study, either in Cyprus or in similar societies where extended family remains significant, at a larger scale. Practical implications - The evidence that household expendituremay not be indicative of household consumption suggests that questions on social context of consumption should be included in HBSs. Originality/value - This paper draws together, for the first time, economic ideas on expenditure on food derived from the quantitative research of Ernst Engel on one hand and implications of the theories of Georg Simmel on the sociology of the meal on the other. The paper shows that some issues arising from quantitative analysis of HBSs cannot be explained using data from that source; this is particularly so where consumption of food is inter-household.","[Jacobson, David S.; McMullan, Caroline] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Minas, Christos] Frederick Univ, Sch Econ Sci & Adm, Nicosia, Cyprus",Dublin City University,"Jacobson, DS (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.",david.jacobson@dcu.ie,"Jacobson, David/D-8598-2012","Jacobson, David/0000-0003-2673-331X; McMullan, Caroline/0000-0002-4229-5690",De Montford University; Manchester Metropolitan University,De Montford University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Dr Christos Minas teaches at the Frederick University, Nicosia, Cyprus.

The purpose of this paper is to assist managers in choosing between both the strategies based upon two governing criteria namely the involvement level of the product category and the level of parent brand equity. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilized an experimental design approach. A 2 (product involvement: high vs low) x2 (parent brand equity: high vs low) x2 (attribute strategy: IB vs IPI) balanced, completely randomized factorial design was set up to test the hypotheses. Findings - Findings suggest that IB strategy should be preferred when the product category is perceived as low involvement or when parent brand equity of the brand is low. The IPI strategy should be preferred when the parent brand equity is high. Either of strategies may be favored in case of high involvement products. Practical implications - The study provides guidance to product managers in choosing between IB and IPI in devising food product development and marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach - Field work was carried out between September and October 2012 in 12 supermarkets belonging to the four most important Chilean retail chains. A log-linear price-attribute function was used to estimate the hedonic price function. The sample included 248 observations olive oil prices available to consumers in the leading supermarkets in the city of Chillan (Chile). Findings - The model estimation results led to the observation that the attributes that most positively influenced final price are oil acidity level, tin can container of imported oil, and origin. On the other hand, the attributes that most negatively influenced final consumer price are retailer house brand and plastic container. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is associated with the geographic area where it was carried out, that is, the city of Chillan in the Bio-Bio Region, which is the second largest region and accounts for 12 per cent of the total population. Further research should include other cities such as Santiago (capital), Concepcion, Curico and Valparaiso. Originality/value - This study can be considered as a first approximation of a hedonic pricing model estimation for olive oil in non-traditional markets like Chile, which is considered an emerging market.","[Romo Munoz, Rodrigo; Lagos Moya, Mario] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Business Management, Chillan, Chile; [Gil, Jose M.] Ctr Res Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Gil, JM (通讯作者)，Ctr Res Agrofood Econ & Dev CREDA, Barcelona, Spain.",chema.gil@upc.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Romo Munoz, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6839-8834","Universidad del Bio-Bio [DIUBB 123518 2/R, PREUS-11-2012]",Universidad del Bio-Bio,This study was funded by a regular internal research project (code No. DIUBB 123518 2/R) and a University Extension project (code No. PREUS-11-2012) of the Universidad del Bio-Bio.

The dataset used in this study covers period from 1999: Q1 to 2013:Q4. Agricultural product groups are based on the SITC classification. Results show that if the Czech foreign trade in agricultural sector is disaggregated into particular product categories, there can be found only some sectors significantly connected with exchange rate movements in the long term. The effects of currency depreciation are less than ambiguous and cannot be generalized across the analysed product categories but increasing in particular trade balances after currency depreciation dominates its decreasing.

The impacts of the multi-period retail price, food freshness and inventory shortage risk on consumers' heterogeneous willingness to pay (WTP) and their strategic purchasing behaviours are studied. Design/methodology/approach - The authors present a price optimization model for perishable food, and conduct a laboratory experiment to justify the theoretical model. The data collected are analysed by correlation analysis and nonparametric test. Findings - The results obtained reveal, first, food freshness and inventory shortage risk have effect on consumers' heterogeneous WTP. Second, different retail prices lead to consumers' strategically purchasing behaviours. Finally, consumers' intertemporal price fairness perception and the food retailer's long-term utility maximization can be achieved by developing multi-period dynamic pricing strategy. Practical implications - This study suggests the perishable food retailer to apply a step-by-step price markdown strategy. It aims at eliminating price unfairness perceptions caused by loss of freshness and high shortage risk of the perishable food in the subsequent selling periods within the shelf life. Some valuable managerial insights towards perishable pricing for food retailers are discussed. Originality/value - This study serves as the first step to utilize a laboratory experiment to dig out consumers' intertemporal WTP towards perishable food. It also presents a novel way for describing consumers' intertemporal price fairness perception by equalizing consumers' average utilities considering consumer surplus, food freshness and shortage risk at different selling periods. The line of research on dynamic pricing concerning consumers' price fairness perception is quite new in academic research, and has arisen due to its importance for food retailers of maximizing their long-term revenues and also of constructing mutual benefit and lasting connections with the consumers.","[Wang, Xiaohuan; Fan, Zhi-Ping; Li, Manning] Northeastern Univ, Dept Informat Management & Decis Sci, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiming] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Stat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Nankai University,"Wang, XH (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Informat Management & Decis Sci, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",xhwang@mail.neu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201020, 71271051, 71201021]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M540233]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N140604003]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors thank the anonymous referees and the editors for many constructive suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.

These problems lie in assigning nurses to teams/shifts such that the constraints regarding both the working regulations and nurses preferences are satisfied. Recent research indicates the dependence of nursing team performance on team social structure; however, so far, the social structure considerations have not been explicitly incorporated into the mathematical formulations of the nurse scheduling problem. The presented framework introduces models that quantitatively exploit such dependence. This paper explores instances of Nurse Team Formation Problem (NTFP) and Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) incorporating signed social structure with the measures based on such network structures as edges, full dyads, triplets, k-stars, balanced and unbalanced triangles, etc., in directed, signed networks. The paper presents the integer programming formulations for NTFP and NSP, and a problem-specific heuristic that performs variable-depth neighborhood search to tackle NTFP instances with signed social structures. Computational results for a real-world problem instance with 20 nurses are reported. The insights obtained from the presented framework and future research directions are discussed.

The club approach begins with a small number of enthusiastic countries. This paper asks under what conditions such clubs are likely to evolve into effective cooperation through side-payments to new members. The question is addressed through a range of formal thought experiments using numerical simulations. The model is calibrated using empirical data on countries' emissions, GDP, populations, and vulnerabilities. It is simple and stylized, but allows for complex and dynamic interactions between actors. Basic equity considerations can be accommodated. The results indicate that side-payments' theoretical potential for facilitating effective clubs is large. One or two large emitters can initiate a club that grows to cover a substantial share of global emissions if the global benefit-cost ratio for mitigation is around 3 or larger. The size of stable clubs is larger if new members contribute to making side-payments, and somewhat lower if equity considerations constrain the set of possible transfers. Side-payments' effect is enabled by the large asymmetries between countries. Total side-payment flows range from tens to hundreds of billions of US dollars annually.","[Saelen, Hakon] CICERO Ctr Climate & Environm Res Oslo, PB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",,"Sælen, H (通讯作者)，CICERO Ctr Climate & Environm Res Oslo, PB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",hakon.salen@cicero.oslo.no,,"Saelen, Hakon/0000-0003-0327-4843",Norwegian Research Council through Strategic Challenges in International Climate and Energy Policy (CICEP),Norwegian Research Council through Strategic Challenges in International Climate and Energy Policy (CICEP),"I would like to thank particularly Jon Hovi, Arild Underdal, and Detlef Sprinz, who have inspired me and helped me greatly in this work.

Our reading of the bibliography in Chinese labour history, together with a preliminary investigation into other primary sources, suggests that the Kuznetsian paradigm for empirical economics may not be viable for the construction of analytical narratives for the Chinese and other premodern imperial economies in South and West Asia. Nevertheless, two datasets currently in print will continue to be quoted to lend support to numerically grounded speculations for levels and trends in real wages and welfare for the families of wage-dependent urban workers in China over the eighteenth century. Statistical evidence for the Ming and Qing dynasties calibrated for the purposes of comparing real wage levels for wage-dependent labour between China and western Europe can, however, be placed on a spectrum for accuracy and inferential analysis that runs from unfounded guess work' to plausible conjectures'. The unwelcome contention of this article is that the data published and potentially available for China (and probably for India and the Ottoman Empire) stand close to the unfounded guess work end of that spectrum. Meanwhile, and as a speculative conclusion, we offer a conjecture that the real wages' for Qing China's tiny proletariat, whose income included high proportions of wages in kind, have remained as elusive as they were when the real wage debate began a decade ago.","[Deng, Kent; O'Brien, Patrick] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Deng, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,118,13,14,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

But how should that money be allocated within those countries? A popular and intuitively plausible answer, in line with the strong standing of the norm of ownership in development aid circles, is that this is for the recipient country to decide. The paper investigates the three most important types of ethical arguments for such 'recipient control': the epistemic argument, the entitlement argument, and the legitimacy argument. It is argued that there is a good case for recipient control in democratic countries, because such countries can be expected to act in the name of the people to whom adaptation finance is ultimately owed. However, the three arguments do not support, even if taken jointly, recipient control in nondemocratic countries. This is a significant result seeing as the majority of the most vulnerable countries are nondemocratic.","[Duus-Otterstrom, Goran] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Duus-Otterström, G (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Box 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",goran.duus-otterstrom@pol.gu.se,"Duus-Otterstrom, Goran/ABC-3942-2021","Duus-Otterstrom, Goran/0000-0001-9133-7300",Swedish Research Council and Formas,Swedish Research Council and Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Previous versions of this paper have been presented at the 6th Uppsala Forum Workshop on Climate Change, at the Centre for Global Democratic Governance at the University of St. Gallen, and at the 17th Nordic Political Science Association congress at the University of Gothenburg.

Wetland creation to mitigate nutrient leakage from agriculture is one example where participation of local farmers is needed. In this case study of the Himmerfjarden coastal catchment, south of Stockholm, Sweden, we assessed the importance of socio-demographic factors, and of the existing agri-environmental scheme (AES), for their effects on farmers' willingness to create wetlands on their farms. The main factors from the AES were defined as five attributes in a discrete choice experiment approach, related to the current AES for wetland creation in the area. The results showed that approximately 30% of the farmers were interested in wetland creation. A common reason for not wanting to create wetlands was cost incurred by the farmer. Males were significantly more willing than females to create wetlands. Prior knowledge of the WFD increased willingness almost threefold, and land owners were significantly more willing than leaseholders. The choice experiment showed that higher cost ceiling for compensation, compensation percentage and annual subsidies can significantly increase the willingness to create wetlands. However, other options like result-oriented AES may be taken into consideration to attract the remaining 70% of all farmers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we will address the questions of 1) how grassroots innovations for sustainable agriculture are scaled and 2) the consequences of crossing different scales and levels on the characteristics of the grassroots innovation. We propose a framework of five different scales to analyze the development of grassroots innovations and we apply this framework on the long-term development of an agricultural grassroots innovation movement that pioneered innovative dairy farming practices combined with landscape management. The results show how the initial innovation coalition built around low external input farming became fragmented. Each of the resulting new grassroots innovation coalitions used different strategies for upscaling and outscaling that depended on differences in their (regional) contexts and institutional support. The grassroots innovation thus developed along three parallel, at times intersecting, innovation pathways. The distributed agency of multiple actor groups working in parallel leads to a continuous renegotiating of meaning that poses a challenge to the idea of planned processes of outscaling and upscaling of grassroots innovations.

Luhmann sought a detailed description of the world as a set of complex systems which he applied to ecology. We discuss the gestation and requirements of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) conceptual framework of 2013, suggesting that as finalised it has little relevance to either sustainability or ecology. Consistent with Luhmann's approach which praises for more consciousness, our research provides no instant blueprint or solution, but a coherent way of understanding and analysing the complex set of systems and sub-systems involved in the multi-capital, multi-measurement-unit, multi-stakeholder and multi-motivated current content of the sustainability issue.

Therefore, grain legumes can potentially decrease global warming, as nitrogen fertilization is responsible for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, grain-legumes have many functional and nutritional properties both as feed and food. Despite the fact that the European Union has granted considerable subsidies to promote grain-legume cultivation, their production continues to fall and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why. This study provides an answer by showing that a situation of technological lock-in has resulted from the co-evolution of crop systems, based on an agrochemical paradigm, public policies, and market dynamics that promote cereals. This process began with the historical choice by European and French public institutions to relegate grain-legumes to feed in direct competition with imported soybeans. Moreover, interrelated factors, such as breeding selection, public subsidies, and food systems, have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of grain-legumes. Finally, the evolutionary economics approach used here identified several actions that must be implemented together, such as agricultural cost-accounting methods, nitrogen management, institutional innovations, and market outlets to promote grain-legumes and move towards more sustainable agriculture.

The dataset contains detailed information about more than 500,000 students at the first year of junior secondary school in the year 2012/2013. By means of multilevel linear models, it is possible to estimate statistically significant school and class effects, after adjusting for pupil's characteristics, including prior achievement. The results show that school and class effects are very heterogeneous across macro-areas (Northern, Central and Southern Italy), and that there are substantial discrepancies between and within schools; overall, class effects on achievement tend to be larger than school ones.

In this article, a known epidemic of plague in the Swedish parish of Brakne-Hoby was studied as a means of testing out the generality of the household distribution of deaths. It was discovered that, in this case, the very heavy mortality was due to two radically different means of spreading the disease, initially the classic bubonic one through the rat flea, and latterly, and somewhat surprisingly, the pneumonic one, through the infection of the inhabitants by their own friends and neighbours.","[Schofield, Roger] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Schofield, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,28,9,9,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Fire disaster is one of the most recurring in the city. Due to haphazard urbanization, poor fire services, few and old fire engines, insufficient skilled human resources combined with narrow road lanes, clustered households increase the fire vulnerability in Kathmandu Metropolitan City. This paper documents the fire station suitability zonation mapping in Kathmandu Metropolitan City using Group Decision Making Process (GDMP) in the GIS interface. Four different selection criteria factors such as distance from roads, land cover, distance from rivers and population density are considered for analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for Group Decision Making Process (GDMP). The results reveal that only 13.46% of the study area is highly suitable for fire station location. Hence, the fire station suitability zonation map is trustworthy and can be used for the construction of new fire stations in Kathmandu Metropolitan City. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An integrated model is developed from research literatures on jurisdictional competition, the double dividend, and on the design of tax-refund instruments. This model shows that jurisdictional welfare increases as environmental rents are initially allocated towards public consumption, yielding a double dividend, but that this dividend may or may not continue as all rents are shifted to public finance. When the double dividend occurs, the rent allocation both improves the efficiency of the tax system and reduces the private-public consumption distortion that decentralized jurisdictional decision-making creates. In some parameter configurations, there is an optimal rental allocation between the private sector and the local government. At this optimum, environmental and fiscal policies are set at their first-best levels and decentralized jurisdictional decision-making is globally efficient. If less rents are allocated to public finance than this optimum, fiscal and environmental policies will be suboptimal, whereas, if too much rent is allocated for public consumption, fiscal and environmental policies will be set at levels above the global efficiency standard. These results illustrate the crucial importance of environmental rent sharing for the efficiency of jurisdictional decision-making. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The body of literature that has examined non-state actor involvement in global governance has focused mainly on whether and how non-state actors can influence states. Less attention has been paid to the comparative advantages of non-state actors to answer questions about agency across categories of non-state actors, and more precisely what governance activities non-state actors are perceived to fulfil. Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, we propose that different categories of non-state actors have distinct governance profiles. We further suggest that the different governance profiles are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a function of these profiles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in the literature focusing on the authority of non-state actors in climate governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the governors'' of global governance.","[Nasiritousi, Naghmeh; Hjerpe, Mattias; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Nasiritousi, N (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",naghmeh.nasiritousi@liu.se; mattias.hjerpe@liu.se; bjorn-ola.linner@liu.se,"Linnér, Björn-Ola/AAL-2040-2020","Nasiritousi, Naghmeh/0000-0003-2727-491X; Hjerpe, Mattias/0000-0002-5500-3300",Swedish Research Council [421-2011-1862]; Formas [2011-779],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This research was made possible through generous grants from the Swedish Research Council (Project No. 421-2011-1862) and Formas (Project No. 2011-779) for the research project non-state actors in the new landscape of international climate cooperation.

It also aims to understand the link between product attributes and consumption intention and behaviour, analysing the role played by intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the theory of planned behaviour considering that individuals do not always have complete control of wine consumption behaviour, especially when they come from a novice market. A questionnaire survey, preceded by an exploratory phase, was conducted in St Louis, Missouri, a novice market for wine. Findings - This study identifies a novice consumer whose choice of a complex product is driven by experiential attitude towards the product more than the conditioning of referents, and even more than the perceived behavioural control and the interconnected concept of risk. The risk is perceived to a greater extent when it has to do with the functional nature of the product linked to its sensory component, rather than with its social or health connotations. Originality/value - This study assesses the role of intrinsic and extrinsic cues and of the perceived behavioural control, assumed as closely interconnected with the concept of risk, in explaining wine consumption intention and behaviour.

However, as this paper argues, carbon pricing in itself may not be sufficient. This is due to the existence of market failures in the process of creation and allocation of credit that may lead commercial banks the most important source of external finance for firms not to respond as expected to price signals. Under certain economic conditions, banks would shy away from lending to low-carbon activities even in the presence of a carbon price. This possibility calls for the implementation of additional policies not based on prices. In particular, the paper discusses the potential role of monetary policies and macroprudential financial regulation: modifying the incentives and constraints that banks face when deciding their lending strategy through, for instance, a differentiation of reserve requirements according to the destination of lending may fruitfully expand credit creation directed towards low-carbon sectors. This seems to be especially feasible in emerging economies, where the central banking framework usually allows for a stronger public control on credit allocation and a wider range of monetary policy instruments than the sole interest rate.

Design/methodology/approach - The initial phase of this qualitative, comparative research involved in-depth interviews with 13 French and 14 British citizens who were each asked to reflect upon foods eaten in the home, preparation methods and issues surrounding dietary practices and culinary cultures. The next phase of the research asked experts working within the field to reflect and elaborate upon the initial findings and in total ten French and nine British experts were interviewed. Findings - The results reveal how to a greater extent French respondents relied upon raw ingredients from which they more regularly prepared traditional, structured and commensal meal occasions. Such a food model remains a significant part of everyday life and culinary cultures in France support the consumption of a relatively healthy diet unlike in Britain. Research limitations/implications - This is a small exploratory study based on a limited number of respondents. Further research would benefit from observing what people actually do rather than relying on what people say they do. Practical implications - Those responsible for promoting healthier diets need to further prioritise the significance of culinary cultures to cooking practices and diet. Originality/value - While the influence of domestic cooking practices on food intake has received some scholarly attention, this paper presents a more holistic insight into how culinary cultures can play a significant mediating role on diets more generally.","[Gatley, Andy] Univ West London, London Coll Hospitality & Tourism, London, England",University of West London,"Gatley, A (通讯作者)，Univ West London, London Coll Hospitality & Tourism, London, England.",andy.gatley@uwl.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,7,7,4,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a survey strategy by means of a questionnaire that was sent to food and drink companies operating in the FSC. In total, 164 SMEs answered the questionnaire. Answers were analysed by means of frequency distributions, coding, and pattern matching, Findings - UK SMEs appear to have a moderate understanding of the definition of traceability. The main drivers for traceability implementation are product safety and quality, even more than regulation. It is also found that SMEs do not consider technology as driver to implement traceability. In term of frameworks employed, about half of the SIVIEs stated that they were regulatory compliant, and followed industry standards. Furthermore, in term of traceability systems' characteristics, one out of three companies have a basic system in place (only regulatory compliant), while two out of three have a more sophisticated system, with many companies voluntarily tracing' the material during' the production process, while chain traceability appears not to be widely implemented. Finally, it is felt that the benefits of traceability outweigh the barriers/disadvantages, with the main benefits found in the area of crisis management. Nonetheless, it appears that many benefits are still unknown to SMEs, especially in relation to the firm's operations/strategy. Some implications for government and managers are suggested. Originality/value - This study fills the gap found in the literature where few recent academic:papers focused attention on SMEs awareness of traceability in the FSC.","[Mattevi, Mattia; Jones, Jeffrey A.] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Mattevi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",mattia.mattevi@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,21,22,1,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used. A total of 402 consumers responded to a structured questionnaire and 58 consumers responded to a survey designed to gather qualitative data. Data analysis involved content analysis, the probit model, frequency distributions and the t-test for two unrelated means. Findings - This study shows that affluent, middle class Chinese citizens are opting out of the conventional food market. There is a gender divide, with men showing a preference for green food and females showing a preference for certified organic food. Certified food purchase is associated with demographic variables, such as income, education, age, gender, presence of young children, household size, living in developed cities and overseas experience. A follow-up study shows that the absence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) motivates the purchase of organic food. Overall, the results suggest that Chinese consumers are turning towards certified food for health reasons and are sceptical about genetic modification (GM) food. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides some insights into how Chinese consumers view innovations in the food sector. The study found that almost half of the sample is unaware that the concept of green food is different to that of organic food. The priority for the certified organic industry is to address this lack of knowledge and clearly explain what certified organic food is and how it differs from green food. Small-scale farmers could use consumer aversion to GMOs as a promotional tool. The ultimate goal of this paper is to help marketers better promote certified organic food, but inferences can be drawn in terms of Chinese sustainable consumption. Negative attitudes towards genetically modified foods exist due to human health concerns. Hence, Chinese policy makers need to confront these perceptions, real or perceived, if they wish to maintain public trust in biotechnology. Practical implications - Based on the qualitative data, stressing the GM-free status is likely to enhance sales since there appears to be a segment of consumers that distrusts GM technology. Originality/value - The contribution of this research lies in examining what drives the adoption of green innovations, notably green food and certified organic food in China. This research is important given that little is known about what Chinese consumers think of, and how they react to, innovations in the agro-food value chain.","[McCarthy, Breda; Liu, Hong-Bo; Chen, Tingzhen] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"McCarthy, B (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",bredam419@gmail.com,"Liu, Hongbo/ABC-7190-2021; McCarthy, Breda/G-5452-2015; Caiazza, Rosa/C-6138-2015","Liu, Hongbo/0000-0002-6422-7680; Caiazza, Rosa/0000-0001-6067-9973; Chen, Tingzhen/0000-0001-6634-2757","James Cook University, Townsville, Australia","James Cook University, Townsville, Australia","The research was funded by a mid-career researcher grant from James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.",,69,46,46,7,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the main benefits of using social networks is the instant knowledge of what consumers are saying about seller/provider allowing respond quickly to this information. However it could be negative point for seller/provider in case when customers do not receive the value they had anticipated. The aim of the paper is to analyze the problems of consumer's interests and rights protection and find out whether social media could be used as a tool for protection of consumers' interests and rights. Based on the EU consumers' surveys analysis, the model of four scenarios of consumers behaviour is created in cases when consumers are not satisfied with goods or services. Scenarios 2 and 3 are used by consumers less often, while Scenarios 1 and 4 are more positive for both - consumer and seller/provider since they allow solving problems without interaction of third parties, create communication flows, trustful relationship, good reputation of seller/provider and develop loyal fans from consumers' side. When companies are presented in social media they have more incentives to resolve the problem of consumers since the information about disloyalty can spread very fast and broadly. Therefore, social media is a natural tool enabling consumers to gain benefits, which help protect their rights.","[Spakovica, Evelina; Moskvins, Genadijs] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Topchiy, Elena] Belgorod Natl Res Univ, Belgorod, Russia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Belgorod State University,"Spakovica, E; Moskvins, G (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.;Topchiy, E (通讯作者)，Belgorod Natl Res Univ, Belgorod, Russia.",evelina.spakovica@llu.lv; logicor@llu.lv; elenamitina93@mail.ru,"MOSKVINS, Genādijs/JBJ-4697-2023","MOSKVINS, Genādijs/0000-0002-2912-6809",,,,,11,0,0,1,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,214.0,222.0,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200026,0

One such sector is the agri-food sector. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed journal articles published from 1990 to 2014, the purpose of this paper is to examine the where, when, and how of the use of BMs and BMI in the agri-food sector. Design/methodology/approach - A web-based search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed journal articles that contained a combination of BM or BMI with agriculture-related and food-related terms (e.g. agri-food sector). After winnowing out irrelevant and duplicate articles, 505 articles were chosen for analysis. Findings - Using categories, the paper analyses various data about the selected articles. The categories include research settings, units of analysis, methodologies, and theories. Based on this analysis, the paper finds that these agri-food sector articles are primarily qualitative, empirical studies that focus on one or a few companies (i.e. case studies). The paper also finds that theory is not yet well-developed in the research on the agri-food sector. Originality/value - SLRs of various concepts, theories, and models are common in many fields (e.g. information/software technology, healthcare, and organizational management). However, no such review is available for the agri-food sector, in particular in its use of BMs and BMI. This paper addresses that gap with its review of relevant articles published in more than 300 journals in recent years. Based on this review, the paper draws conclusions about BMI in the agri-food sector and offers suggestions for future research.","[Tell, Joakim; Hoveskog, Maya; Ulvenblad, Pia; Ulvenblad, Per-Ola; Barth, Henrik; Stahl, Jenny] Halmstad Univ, CIEL, Halmstad, Sweden",Halmstad University,"Tell, J (通讯作者)，Halmstad Univ, CIEL, Halmstad, Sweden.",joakim.tell@hh.se,"Barth, Henrik/M-5186-2017; Caiazza, Rosa/C-6138-2015; Hoveskog, Maya/J-8644-2015","Barth, Henrik/0000-0002-0030-3402; Caiazza, Rosa/0000-0001-6067-9973; Hoveskog, Maya/0000-0002-5849-1442",Swedish Knowledge Foundation,Swedish Knowledge Foundation,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Swedish Knowledge Foundation.,,38,53,57,6,89,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This research focuses on one case study. The subject of the case study under analysis is Pio Cesare, an internationally recognized fine wine Italian company. Findings - Pio Cesare is characterized by a strong combination of tradition and innovation in terms of products and processes. Innovation and tradition are not opposites; on the contrary, a blend of the two has been crucial in achieving and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - The formalization of an effective blend of tradition and innovation, especially in a family business, and an effective dissemination of the company philosophy to future generations, calls for a more in-depth study. This study has some limitations, which determined by the applied methodology. Multiple case study method would be useful. In relation to the interview technique, the authors would set out to increase the number of interviews, by also questioning managers and employees working, as opposed to family members. Practical implications - Practical implications relate to different groups of stakeholders: for owners and management, for investors, for organizations and institutions working on a territory promotion and in the tourism sector, and for politicians and local authorities. Originality/value - It identifies which business model a family winery business could be adopted in order to manage such strategies of innovation in respect to traditions, filling the gap in the literature.","[Vrontis, Demetris] Univ Nicosia, Dept Mkt, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Bresciani, Stefano] Univ Turin, Sch Management & Econ, Dept Business Management, Turin, Italy; [Giacosa, Elisa] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy",University of Nicosia; University of Turin; University of Turin,"Giacosa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",elisa.giacosa@unito.it,"Bresciani, Stefano/U-2802-2019; Vrontis, Demetris/AAI-3458-2021; giacosa, elisa/AAF-6964-2019","GIACOSA, Elisa/0000-0002-0445-3176; Vrontis, Prof. Demetris/0000-0001-7570-6241; Bresciani, Stefano/0000-0003-0321-9174",,,,,75,174,179,6,111,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This study aims to identify and value socio-environmental liabilities from coal mining at different stages of the coal life cycle. Environmental liabilities can be operationalized under three types of responsibilities: moral, legal, and economic. The identification of environmental liabilities allocates moral responsibility; the legal responsibility is needed for effective reparation; and the economic valuation provides arguments to claim compensation, seek remediation, and mitigation of damages. To identify socio-environmental liabilities, interviews were conducted and environmental mining conflicts were analyzed. To estimate monetary values, data were linked to existing literature on costs associated with damages. Results show that the economic values of socio-environmental liabilities per ton of extracted and exported coal are higher than the market price of coal. The main socio-environmental liabilities arise from pollution, local health deterioration, water table depletion, land and ecosystem services losses, damages from transportation and shipping, and coal reserve loss. A comparison with studies in China and the United States indicates that values increase when other health impacts and climate change on a global scale are included. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that while over the entire period, capital and labor inputs explain the bulk of Korean real income growth, productivity growth has come to play an increasingly important role since the mid-1990s, providing some evidence of a transition from 'input-led' to 'productivity-led' growth.

In this paper we experimentally test the effectiveness of complementing financial nudging/incentives with nudging for empathy. Our framed experiment models a situation in which an upstream farmer influences the water quality downstream by choosing the level of conservation. Financial nudging is represented by a crop insurance subsidy conditional on conservation compliance (consistent with the 2014 Farm Bill policy). Empathy nudging is represented by a downstream water user sending a message to the upstream farmer encouraging the latter to walk-in-the-shoes/take the perspective of the former. We found that empathy nudging can counteract the elimination of financial incentives. However, it is less effective than financial nudging. Empathy nudging coupled with financial incentives has a synergic effect and conservation increased significantly compared to using one of the nudges alone. Furthermore, the combination of empathy and financial nudging was particularly effective in low (initial) conservation cases. We argue that policy makers and the public should encourage empathy conservation and that the environmental policy narrative should appeal to empathy and call for farmers to join the cause for conservation and environmental protection.

Eutrophication from fertilizer runoff is the key driver behind growth of hypoxic dead zones where fish production comes to a standstill. Governments heavily subsidize BMPs, but do not generally allocate funds to maximize their environmental benefits. But with ever-increasing fiscal constraints, policy makers are searching for ways to enhance efficiency of BMP programs. Pay for performance presents an alternative platform based on nutrient reduction achieved. This paper compares a conventional subsidy approach with pay for performance for BMPs designed to reduce nutrient pollution into the Chesapeake Bay. We model four paired scenarios using a constrained optimization model. In the first pairing we held the level of nutrient reduction constant and compared cost effectiveness of the two subsidy allocation methods. In the second pairing we held the level of program investment constant and compared nutrient reduction outcomes. In both pairings, pay for performance was far superior delivering identical nutrient reduction outcomes at less than half the cost in the first and delivering two to three times the amount of nutrient reduction for the same budget allocation in the second.

Coastal hazards including inundation, salinisation of the water supply, and land erosion all threaten vital infrastructure that support coastal communities. This research, part of the International Community-University Research Alliance (ICURA) C-Change project Managing Adaptation to Environmental Change in Coastal Communities: Canada and the Caribbean, develops and applies a multicriteria decision evaluation and support system for evaluating adaptation options for coastal communities. The paper estimates vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity measures associated with adaptation strategies in coastal communities with respect to their environmental, economic, social, and cultural dimensions. Results are determined using a multi-participant formulation of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for identifying multicriteria decisions as adaptation strategies in a specific coastal context. The application of the framework is conducted for the coastal community of Little Anse on Isle Madame, Nova Scotia. Specifically, the state of the Little Anse breakwater is analysed and adaptation options for protecting, accommodating, and retreating are presented and evaluated in the face of predicted storm scenarios. The results indicate that, in the case of Little Anse, the strategic decision to protect the community by a new breakwater arm provides preferred measures for resilience and adaptive capacity.

The approach is based on applying a dynamic equilibrium model with externalities in production, consumption, and leisure. Preference heterogeneity regarding status competition is modeled by asymmetric consumption externality parameters whereas heterogeneity regarding voluntary simplicity is incorporated by allowing for agent-specific restrictions on maximum consumption. Equilibrium is studied in terms of a balanced growth path (BGP). Numerical examples suggest that degrowth triggered by voluntary simplicity by a subset of consumers less affected by status competition has a positive effect on the aggregate welfare under externalities in consumption and leisure. A reduction in status competition increases the aggregate welfare and reduces the equilibrium growth rate. Simulations suggest that a time-varying equilibrium in the heterogeneous preference model with two consumer classes is well approximated by a constant BGP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Part of the conundrum arises from the limitations of available probate evidence, but the motivational drivers behind raised consumption can also be questioned. Was it changed tastes or falling prices because of improved technology which prompted the purchase of new goods? Utilizing evidence from an alternative source, property stolen through housebreaking and burglary as reported in the Old Bailey Papers and Proceedings for 1750-1821, we identify those goods that were commonly stolen as the fashion icons of their day, trace such goods back to their original owners, thus linking ownership and status, and through analysis over time show how consumption evolved. This analysis incorporates the influence of price and real incomes on ownership, allowing the influence of price and fashion on consumption patterns to be identified separately. The findings show that, in addition to price and income effects, fashion had a strong influence, but this was not just emulation; differentiation too was evident. The evidence points to a complex interplay between desires and differentiation, aspiration and affordability, in determining the goods that people possessed.","[Horrell, Sara; Sneath, Ken] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Horrell, Sara] Murray Edwards Coll, Cambridge, England; [Humphries, Jane] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Humphries, Jane] Univ Oxford All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England; [Sneath, Ken] Peterhouse Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Cambridge,"Horrell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,"Humphries, Jane/GQA-8830-2022",,"Ellen Macarthur Fund, University of Cambridge","Ellen Macarthur Fund, University of Cambridge","We are grateful to the Ellen Macarthur Fund, University of Cambridge, for a grant which enabled much of the data inputting.

The methodology allows flexibility of choice regarding whose values count and who should be the valuing agent. The methodology was trialled with community participants and scientific experts. The building blocks of the Framework can be used to construct different model variants, each of which reveals key characteristics of ecosystem services in SEQ The approach adopted to value ecosystems and ecosystem services offers scope for decision makers to think more broadly about possible impacts of decisions on the wellbeing of the community and has facilitated the inclusion of ecosystem services in statutory planning policy in SEQ.

However, certain outdated assumptions tied to Homo economicus persist, often influencing discourse and research design even in sustainability-oriented fields. We argue this 'ghost' of Homo economicus endures because the diversity of findings that confound the canonical model has surfaced across multiple behavioral and cognitive sciences, each with its own terminology and focus area. As such, a unified, accessible synthesis of this new information has yet to emerge. In this paper we review recent insights from across the behavioral and cognitive sciences, and propose an 'efficient complexity manager' (ECM) model (Homo efficens) as the best synthesizing option. The crux of this model is that our species works within biological limits to efficiently filter massive environmental complexity. This is achieved largely through analogical or 'case-based' reasoning. We explain this synthesized model using a series of accessible metaphors. Finally, we speculate on how this model may enrich future sustainable development research insofar as it points to fruitful units of analysis, can stimulate methodological innovation, and provide a more explicit theoretical foundation for the field.

Scholars in the field seek to identify the international and domestic factors that increase state commitment to international environmental treaties and agreements. Counter to the traditional literature on international environmental commitment, this paper reconceptualizes both traditional and alternative theories in order to identify domestic institutional factors that may increase state cooperation with international environmental agreements. In particular, this study posits that democratic governments in comparison to authoritarian governments increase state compliance with international environmental agreements; however, there may be domestic environmental conditions, such as limited access to clean water that may constrain democracies in participating in international environmental agreements. This study presents a quantitative analysis measuring the effects of democracy on state compliance behaviors with international environmental agreements. The results of the study provide support for an alternative bottom-up theoretical framework focusing on domestic environmental politics in addressing international environmental agreements.","[Carbonell, Joel R.] Kent State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, North Canton, OH 44720 USA; [Allison, Juliann E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Polit Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Carbonell, JR (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stark Campus, North Canton, OH 44720 USA.",jcarbon2@kent.edu; Juliann.Allison@ucr.edu,,,,,,,38,11,13,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The paper exploits the Domesday Survey data, collected in 1086, to investigate the entrepreneurial ability of managers of the main classes of estate, king's, ecclesiastical and lay estates. Wiltshire data are used to assess whether similar production functions describe production on the three classes of estate. Then, data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods are used to assess whether, after controlling for factors that could have affected efficiency, one class of estate was worked more efficiently. Finally, the Wiltshire results are compared with those from an earlier study of Essex. The Wiltshire analysis confirms the conclusions of the Essex study.

Relying on qualitative research at a variety of levels, the paper seeks to answer the question: What does the Belo Monte case portend for our understanding of the capacity of green economy to facilitate a greater environmental sensitivity in a national context? The case study illustrates how green activism has been weakened by a combination of self-interested calculations by activists and strategic maneuvers by the state. Critically for environmental policymaking, the case study reveals how the state and its international allies can use the green economy discourse as a hegemonic tool to isolate opposition, break alliances, and further resource-extraction-oriented economic policies.","Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Bratman, E (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",Ebratman@gmail.com,"Bratman, Eve/AAU-3643-2021","Bratman, Eve/0000-0002-0250-446X",School of International Service at American University,School of International Service at American University,I am grateful to The School of International Service at American University for their generous support of this research.,,58,35,39,1,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on structured questionnaire survey through personal interviews of 1,200 school children of primary and upper primary schools of four districts of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Simple statistical tools such as descriptive statistics, factor analysis, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been used for meaningful data analysis. Findings - Pupils' responses on 17 attributes of their satisfaction on school meal program were reduced to four components - quality of food, social bonding, health and hygiene and availability of support infrastructure, using factor analysis technique. Findings show the perceived differences in satisfaction on various aspects of MDM program. Further, ANOVA indicate that there is significant difference in the satisfaction level on MDM supplied through centralized and decentralized kitchens. Practical implications - This study provides an understanding of pupils' perceptions of school meal program in order to enable policy makers, school administration and caterers of MDM to design better food service delivery models. Social implications - Findings of the study clearly indicate that benefit of social bonding is an added advantage to continue the school meal program irrespective of the fact whether food is served through centralized or decentralized kitchens. Originality/value - There are several evaluation studies undertaken by various agencies to assess the impact of MDM program in India. However, there are only limited numbers of studies available, which have analyzed the children's satisfaction on school MDM program across kitchen types.","[Ali, Jabir] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Akbar, Mohammad] Indian Inst Management, Strateg Management Grp, Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship Area, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Ali, J (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jabirali@iiml.ac.in,"Ali, Jabir/I-1955-2019","Ali, Jabir/0000-0002-5891-568X","Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow","Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow","This study has been supported by the Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow.",,45,2,3,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between access to food stores and adult BMI in Italy, accounting also for the synergic role of individuals' eating habits. Design/methodology/approach - To study the relationship between access to different food outlets, eating habits, and adult BMI in Italy, the authors combine three years of individual-level data with region-level food stores' density measures and account for store location endogeneity using a Generalized Method of Moment estimator. Findings - While large stores and specialty fruit and vegetable stores show a BMI decreasing effect, local/convenience stores show little to no effect on adult BMI. The effect of access on adult BMI varies conditionally on dietary habits, since access to food outlets and healthy eating can have a synergic impact on reducing Italian adults' BMI.

Cava is a multiregional designation of origin: although it is a product typical of a particular Spanish region (Catalonia), it is also produced in other regions in Spain. Design/methodology/approach - The technique of conjoint analysis is used to identify the structure of the preferences of cava consumers, and to evaluate how that structure is affected by the inclusion of a message that highlights the regional origin of the product. A survey was conducted among 473 wine buyers in the region of Extremadura (Spain). Findings - The main findings show that the region-of-origin effect is significant for the regional buyer of this type of wine, and that the sales of regional brands of cava would be greater if their regional origin were emphasized by indicating the location of the producer in a prominent place on the label. Moreover, three segments of purchasers differentiated by their preference structure are identified. Originality/value - The novelty of the study lies in the fact that this PDO is a multiregional designation of origin, and that the technique used, conjoint analysis, is applied not only to determine the buyer's preference structure, but also to evaluate how that structure is affected when the regional origin of the product is highlighted in the message to the purchaser. This study is of value to academic researchers, wineries managers, and regional governments as it highlights important aspects to design marketing strategies and trade policies.","[Chamorro, Antonio; Rubio, Sergio; Javier Miranda, F.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Business Management & Sociol, Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Miranda, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Business Management & Sociol, Badajoz, Spain.",fmiranda@unex.es,"Chamorro-Mera, Antonio/M-1602-2014; Rubio, Sergio/D-5821-2013; Miranda, F.

Originality/value - Most research in layout planning is typically developed in productive industrial areas, and this paper contributes to the understanding the differences of implementing SLP methodology in a food service business, such as restaurant, and proposes the utilization of specific layout indicators.","[Flessas, Milena; Rizzardi, Vinicius] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ind Engn, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Tortorella, Guilherme Luz; Fettermann, Diego] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Syst & Ind Engn Dept, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Marodin, Giuliano A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Management Sci, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Tortorella, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Syst & Ind Engn Dept, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",gtortorella@bol.com.br,"Marodin, Giuliano A/E-6758-2013; Fettermann, Diego/A-7399-2012; Fettermann, Diego Castro/AAK-5973-2021; Fettermann, Diego/AAK-5971-2021","Fettermann, Diego/0000-0001-9210-8622; Fettermann, Diego Castro/0000-0001-9210-8622; Fettermann, Diego/0000-0001-9210-8622; Tortorella, Guilherme/0000-0003-2396-4665; Marodin, Giuliano/0000-0002-9935-2780",,,,,50,6,9,3,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - As a first step a deterministic retail-to-home model was constructed for the Chilean susceptible population, including storage, cross-contamination and cooking. Next, two probabilistic models were developed, including variability and/or the uncertainty of some of the parameters. The probabilistic models were analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations with 100,000 iterations. Findings - Of the total susceptible population used in the model (2.81 million people), the deterministic model estimated 11 and two listeriosis cases because of beef and poultry consumption, respectively and the variability model estimated a mean of 322 and 7,546 cases for beef and poultry consumption, respectively. The uncertainty analysis showed large ranges, with realistic estimates made with an initial concentration of Listeria monocytogenes of 0.04-1 CFU/g and a dose-response parameter r ranging from 10-14 to 10-10. Research limitations/implications - The lack of information was the major limitation of the model, so the generation of it has to be a priority in Chile for developing less uncertain risk assessments in the future. Practical implications - Raw animal products can be the cause of listeriosis cases if they are not stored, cooked and/or handled properly. Consumer education seems to be an essential factor for disease prevention. Originality/value - This is the first QMRA made in Chile, and also the first study of listeriosis in non-processed meat.","[Foerster, Claudia] Adv Ctr Chron Dis ACCDis, Dept Publ Hlth, Santiago, Chile; [Figueroa, Guillermo] Univ Chile, Lab Microbiol & Probiot, Santiago, Chile; [Evers, Eric] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Ctr Infect Dis Control, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands",Universidad de Chile; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Foerster, C (通讯作者)，Adv Ctr Chron Dis ACCDis, Dept Publ Hlth, Santiago, Chile.",claudia.foerster@gmail.com,"Foerster, Claudia/H-7013-2013","Foerster, Claudia/0000-0001-8452-5362",CONICYT fellowship,CONICYT fellowship(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),The authors wish to thank Dr. Arie Havelaar and Dr. Jurgen Chardon for helpful comments and suggestions.

Our findings suggest that even in the face of higher economic returns, some farmers may be reluctant to convert land to forestry as to do so would not be in keeping with their productivist attitudes. Other farmers may fear losing the non-pecuniary benefits derived from 'working the land'. We conclude that economic incentives alone are unlikely to encourage certain cohorts of farmers to consider alternative land uses such as farm forestry and that policy ought to be guided by a better understanding of the differing fanning motivations of farm operators.

The purpose of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and take into account the consumers' perceived animosity, religiosity, and ethnocentrism to connect these with perceived service quality and purchase intentions of US-based fast food brand chains currently operating in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected data by means of a self-administered questionnaire, distributed among 500 consumers, randomly selected, patronized the four US fast food brands, namely, McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Subway in the city of Lahore in Pakistan. The data are analyzed by employing Structural equation modeling (SEM) based on AMOS 21.0 software. Findings - Results of this study reveal that religiosity and ethnocentrism among Pakistani fast food consumers are low and do not influence the decision to purchase fast food brands. However, consumer emotions influence service quality perceptions - ultimately leading to purchase intentions. Originality/value - The study generally adds to marketing and specifically to international food service marketing knowledge by eliciting the role of religiosity, animosity, and ethnocentrism to delineate service quality and purchase intentions.

Design/methodology/approach - Food safety content specialists, learning experts, programmers, illustrators, project managers, instructional designers, scriptwriters, and stakeholders were involved in creation of the Don't Be Gross short videos before evaluation by middle school youth (sixth to eighth grades). The experimental group (n = 220) completed the following activities at about one-week intervals: pre-test, viewed videos, post-test, and follow-up test. The control group (n = 112) completed the same activities at similar intervals but did not have access to the videos until after the follow-up test. Findings - Controlling for grade and gender, linear mixed-effects models revealed significant time by group effects for participants' perceived susceptibility to foodborne illness; intentions to perform recommended food safety behaviors approached significance. Additionally, compared to the pre-test, the experimental group perceived their friends as being significantly more confident in performing food safety behaviors at post-and follow-up tests. Google Analytics data revealed that the bounce rate from the home page of the videos was low (38 percent) suggesting that the videos were engaging.

The study presents a survey of 104 industries from different sectors to identify the main motivational factors and firms' characteristics that determine the adoption of EMS practices by firms. The empirical evidence suggested that the comprehensiveness of the adopted EMS practices is positively influenced by relational motivations as firms consider their image, compliance and prevention of environmental incidents as significant drivers to implement EMS practices. Firms are also expected to adopt EMS practices to stay competitive if other firms are implementing similar EMS practices. However, the results show that Indian firms do not consider innovation and cost saving as a significant motivation to employ EMS practices. The findings also confirm that larger firms are more likely to adopt comprehensive EMS practices compared to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The results show that compared to the service sector, firms in manufacturing, chemical and agricultural sectors are more likely to adopt comprehensive EMS practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - A web-based survey was conducted for data collection in December 2013 with 541 participants from two Chinese cities: Shanghai and Xi'an. The participants reported about the image of European food and characterized European food according to 14 items for product-related beliefs and 18 items for perceived profiles. Descriptive analysis, cluster analysis and partial least squares regression were employed for data analyses. Findings - Findings show that European food has a unanimously positive image among mainland Chinese consumers. Three consumer segments were distinguished based on attribute beliefs about European food: a positive-beliefs segment, a negative-beliefs segment and an unfamiliar segment. The characteristics of typical European food consumers were high income, having long overseas experience, having visited Europe or living in a big and developed city. In addition, safe and upscale were the most important attribute beliefs driving mainland Chinese consumers to have a positive image of European food; while unfamiliar and sweet were the most negative drivers of European food's image. Originality/value - This is the first study to present information about consumer beliefs, general image and consumer segments in relation to European food in mainland China. These insights can help European food marketers to better understand mainland Chinese consumers and the current image of their products in mainland China so that they can develop effective marketing strategies for this huge and potential food market.","[Wang, Ou] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Agrofood Mkt & Chain Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Verbeke, Wim] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Agrofood Mkt & Consumer Behav, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Wang, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",ou.wang@ugent.be,"Wang, Ou/H-6346-2014; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Wang, Ou/0000-0002-7976-3232; Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",,,,,37,9,9,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In contrast with the widely accepted negative relation between democracy and military spending, the paper suggests that democratic governments established in the late 1970s and early 1980s after Franco's dictatorship had a positive influence on the military burden owing to the efforts to reorient the army towards international threats and to involve the armed forces with the newly democratic institutions. In addition, the analysis of military expenditure allows us to conclude that the international orientation of democratic military policies took place along with financial efforts to obtain a capital-intensive army to confront international military threats.","[Sabate, Oriol] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Sabaté, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",oriol.sabate@ub.edu,,"Sabate, Oriol/0000-0001-6533-8174",,,,,76,3,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

This effect is modeled through the use of an event-specific production technology, which is empirically implemented using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A regional biodiversity variable and two variables reflecting impacts of pesticides on farmland biodiversity are used to partition the data into high and low pest infestation events. The DEA representation is applied to data from Dutch arable farms. Results show that the degree of inefficiency overstatement from a model that ignores the event-specific nature of the production technology increases with pest infestation. Mean environmental inefficiency of the sample farms is low, implying that these farms are, on average, minimizing their impacts on farmland biodiversity. Environmental inefficiency provides an indicator of farm-level environmental sustainability that could help towards a more effective distribution of farm-support payments and make agriculture more environmentally sound.","[Skevas, Theodoros] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Serra, Teresa] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 335 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Skevas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 200 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",skevast@missouri.edu,,,,,,,54,13,14,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It is applied to compare in a French context the relative effects and efficiency of six popular sustainable diet recommendations. The results confirm the synergies between the health and environmental dimensions: healthy-eating recommendations usually have a positive effect on the environment, although some exceptions exist. Most of the sustainable diet recommendations appear highly cost-effective, but those most commonly promoted on health grounds (e.g., targeting consumption of salt, fruits and vegetables and saturated fat) rank highest in terms of overall efficiency. Moreover, the valuation of benefits indicates that in most cases health benefits are significantly larger than environmental benefits. Overall, the analysis reveals some under-investment in the promotion of sustainable diet recommendations in France. The general lack of enthusiasm in policy circles for informational measures promoting behavioural change may reflect unrealistic expectations about the speed and magnitude of dietary change rather than an objective assessment of the efficiency of those measures.

Electoral franchise, fiscal capacity and the rise of mass schooling across Italy's provinces, 1870-1911",CLIOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Schooling; Electoral franchise; Fiscal capacity; Italy,GROWTH,"Italy's regions experienced different rates of human capital accumulation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although southern regions were very disadvantaged when the unification of the country took place in 1861, they caught up at a very slow pace-and a remarkable regional divide in education persisted until the interwar period. While previous hypotheses have focused on the role played by fiscal capacity, this paper sheds new light on the effect that enfranchisement had on the growth of schooling. The presence of large regional disparities in local electoral franchise is confirmed by the data; however, the relationship between voting rights, the intensity of local direct taxation and municipal fiscal capacity is weak at best. Furthermore, if the impact of these factors is analysed separately through a number of econometric models, fiscal capacity stands out as the most significant determinant of education across Italy's provinces. Against recent hypotheses, these results show that the different distribution of political voice within Italy's municipalities did not determine the persistence of regional inequalities in schooling in the long run: it was Italy's national education system, together with remarkable and pre-existent regional disparities, that slowed down the development of human capital in rural and southern regions, with immense costs in terms of future prospects for economic growth and human development.","[Cappelli, Gabriele] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Cappelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",gabriele.cappelli@uni-tuebingen.de,"Cappelli, Gabriele/N-6509-2015","Cappelli, Gabriele/0000-0001-8934-953X",,,,,63,24,26,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2016,10.0,3,,,,,311.0,343.0,,10.1007/s11698-015-0133-2,0.0,,,33,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DR9NS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380224000003,0

These deliberative methods are subject to criticisms. One issue of concern is that the socio-economic inequalities among members of the deliberative group may severely impede communication and consequently distort deliberative outcomes. To examine such possibility we applied the deliberative methodology in a case study of forest conservation in Colombia. We found that those individuals who assumed social (environmental) leadership positions tended to dominate group discussion. Nevertheless, the variations in the capacity to engage in group deliberation were better explained by participants' personal characteristics than external constraints or group pressure. Also, there was little evidence that leadership and domination in group deliberation significantly influenced participants' stated WTP. We conclude that DMV is vulnerable to the background inequalities among group members. The democratic potential of deliberative methods should be critically examined in terms of the capacity to communicate effectively and equally. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the time, the stud, made famous by her great grandfather, William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was in temporary eclipse and run down. He resolved to restore its fortunes. However, beset by debts and with other expensive interests to distract him, including the purchase of books and manuscripts, he allowed the stud to decay, winding it up just over a decade later. With careful management and sound, timely investment, Harley could have restored its fortunes. However, he hoped to re-establish the stud 'on the cheap', utilizing the top class stallions and mares he had at his disposal to produce first-rate foals, from which he would select the best as replacements. Sadly, too few of the foals came up to expectations. In vain, his agent advised him to retire the ageing mares and invest in suitable replacements. His failure to do so soon impacted on the quality and the number of horses produced. Inevitably, he failed, providing contemporaries and historians alike with an object lesson on how not to run a 'top-end' stud.","[Edwards, Peter] Univ Roehampton, London, England",Roehampton University,"Edwards, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roehampton, London, England.",,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We reconstruct the Net Primary Productivity for Spanish agro-ecosystems, but also the main Economy-Wide/material flow accounting indicators as Domestic Extraction of biomass, Physical Balance Trade PTB) and Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) of biomass in Spain. The main results shows that the transition from agrarian to industrial metabolism has meant a decrease in the per capita consumption of biomass. However, in absolute terms, the consumption of biotic materials has also increased considerably. This has been due to the changes in the functionality of biomass for social metabolism as a whole: it has gone from being the main source of energy and materials to specializing in two essential functions, the provision of raw materials for industry and the supply of food. The Spanish case confirms that the industrialization of agriculture has led to an increase in pressure on the Spanish agro-ecosystems. But there has also been a transfer of pressure on agro-ecosystems of other countries through international trade. Spain is a net biomass importer in order to maintain a diet that is ever richer in meat and dairy products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the concept of inclusive development emphasizes the social, ecological and political dimensions of development. In this context, this paper addresses the question: What does inclusive development mean and to what extent is it taken into account in the framing of the SDGs? It presents inclusive development as having three key dimensions (social, ecological, and relational inclusiveness) with five principles each. This is applied to the 17 SDGs and their targets. The paper concludes that while the text on the SDGs fares quite well on social inclusiveness, it fares less well in respect to ecological and relational inclusiveness. This implies that there is a risk that implementation processes also focus more on social inclusiveness rather than on ecological and relational inclusiveness. Moreover, in order to de facto achieve social inclusiveness in the Anthropocene, it is critical that the latter two are given equal weight in the actual implementation process.","[Gupta, Joyeeta] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Governance & Inclus Dev Programme Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Vegelin, Courtney] Univ Amsterdam, Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Amsterdam,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Governance & Inclus Dev Programme Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Gupta, J (通讯作者)，UNESCO, IHE Inst Water Management, Delft, Netherlands.",j.gupta@uva.nl; c.l.vegelin@uva.nl,"Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013","Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660",,,,,60,329,352,44,303,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In this paper we use multiple years of the U.S.-based Community Tracking Survey to examine whether a variety of physician compensation structures chosen by practices influence the likelihood that the practice takes new patients from a variety of different types of insurance. Specifically, we examine the roles of customer satisfaction and quality measures on the one hand, and individual physician productivity measures on the other hand, in determining whether or not firms are more likely to accept patients who have private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. In the United States these different types of insurance mechanisms cover populations with different levels of vulnerability. Medicare (elderly and disabled individuals) and Medicaid (low income households) enrollees commonly have lower ability to pay any cost sharing associated with care, are more likely to have multiple comorbidities (and so be more costly to treat), and may be more sensitive to poor access. Further, these two insurers also generally reimburse less generously than private payors. Thus, if lower reimbursements interact with compensation mechanisms to discourage physician practices from accepting new patients, highly vulnerable populations may be at even greater risk than generally appreciated. We control for the potential endogeneity of incentive choice using a multi-level propensity score method. We find that the compensation incentives chosen by practices are statistically and economically significant predictors for the types of new patients that practices accept. These findings have important implications for both policy makers and private health care systems.","[Bullock, Justin B.] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX USA; [Bradford, W.

Comparison of these estimates with revised estimates for 1861-1911 suggests that the decline in inequality in the first half of the twentieth century forms part of a trend of declining regional inequality and catch-up of the poorer regions with the richest (the South East) dating back to the 1860s at least. This convergence trend was interrupted by the First World War and the subsequent difficulties of Outer Britain in the 1920s when the gap between the South East and the rest widened. However, sometime after 1931 it picked up again. Since 1971 inequality has worsened and catch-up has stopped; indeed, there has been divergence of the South East from the rest. This divergence has been especially marked since 1991. Although growth for all regions was faster during the period of increasing regional inequality that encompasses the second half of the twentieth century, the golden age of economic growth for regions outside the South East occurred during the long boom following the Second World War.",,,,,,"Stark, Thomas/0000-0003-1059-5047",,,,,32,20,22,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was applied to 1,201 consumers in charge of buying vegetables for their households. The questionnaire measured consumer preference for FSL using tomatoes as a case study. Findings - The most important attributes for consumers were price (57.3 percent), FSL (19.7 percent), point of sale (11.86 percent) and production system (11.07 percent). Cluster analysis was used to differentiate three types of consumers. The majority (50.5 percent) are consumers oriented to price of tomatoes more than other attributes. A second group (30.1 percent) considers it important to purchase tomatoes at the lowest price with the existence of a FSL. A minority (19.4 percent) was oriented to purchasing tomatoes with a FSL. The groups differ according to sociodemographic characteristics, food safety knowledge and frequency of vegetables consumption. Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted in country in South America. The results revealed that the majority of consumers choose price over FSL. Nevertheless, a potential market niche was identified that was motivated by FSL as a potential risk-reduction strategy when making choices about fresh vegetables purchase. Practical implications - FSL is a marketing tool to help the consumers about food decisions. Social implications - To avoid problems associated to unsafe vegetables, FSL is used as a potential risk-reduction strategy when making choices about fresh vegetables purchase. Originality/value - The research provides information about a market niche of consumers interested in the existence of an explicit FSL, due to their awareness of the risks associated with the consumption of vegetables. This topic has received little research in Latin American developing countries.","[Adasme-Berrios, Cristian] Univ Catolica Maule, Talca, Chile; [Sanchez, Mercedes] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Mora, Marcos] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Schnettler, Berta] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Lobos, German; Diaz, Jose] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Maule; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Talca,"Adasme-Berríos, C (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Maule, Talca, Chile.",cadasme@ucm.cl,"Marcos, Mora/B-9063-2015; LOBOS, GERMAN/V-8128-2019; Adasme-Berríos, Cristian/D-4572-2016; Sanchez, Mercedes/I-1325-2015","LOBOS, GERMAN/0000-0002-6155-4870; Adasme-Berríos, Cristian/0000-0003-1466-6420; Sanchez, Mercedes/0000-0002-9959-5643",,,,,100,9,9,3,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although focusing predominantly on food, the purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and universal methodology to quantify the degrees of leanness and agility at any point within any supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Daily processing capacities of stochastic model runs and real supply chain data were projected onto a standardized Euclidean surface. Indexes that calculate, amongst others, the agility, leanness, baseline production and ceiling conditions were derived. Findings - The indexes were often well correlated across the various supply chains. Leanness correlates negatively with agility, as can be expected, however, these attributes do not stand opposed to each other. Most supply chains seem to exhibit both lean and agile attributes simultaneously. Sugar, various types of tomatoes, avocado and onion supply chains are discussed and compared. Although a large amount of data were analysed, there exists an opportunity to widen this study significantly. Originality/value - This paper presents a unique and simple approach to quantify the degree of supply chain leanness and agility. Although these terms are often used, only a few authors have made attempts to quantify these attributes and in most cases the approaches are relatively cumbersome. The relatively simple indexes create an opportunity for supply chain management to measure, evaluate and communicate their strategies along the supply chain and between different chains.","[Bezuidenhout, C.

In contrast, in the early twenty-first century, Bolivia is one of the poorest economies on the continent. According to Acemoglu et al. (Q J Econ 117(4):1231-1294, 2002), this disparity between precolonial opulence and current poverty would make Bolivia a perfect example of reversal of fortune (RF). This hypothesis, however, has been criticized for oversimplifying long-term development processes by compressing history (Austin in J Int Dev 20:996-1027, 2008). In the case of Bolivia, a comprehensive description and explanation of the RF process would require a global approach to the entire postcolonial era, which has been prevented so far by the lack of quantitative information for the period before 1950. This paper aims to fill that gap by providing new income per capita estimates for Bolivia in 1890-1950 and a point guesstimate for the mid-nineteenth century. Our figures indicate that divergence has not been a persistent feature of Bolivian economic history. Instead, it was concentrated in the nineteenth century and the second half of the twentieth century, and it was actually during the latter that the country joined the ranks of the poorest economies in Latin America. By contrast, during the first half of the twentieth century, the country converged with both the industrialized and the richest Latin American economies. The Bolivian postcolonial era cannot therefore be described as one of sustained divergence. Instead, the Bolivian RF was largely the combined result of post-independence stagnation and the catastrophic crises of the late twentieth century.","[Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Alejandro Peres-Cajias, Jose] Univ Catolica Boliviana San Pablo, Escuela Prod & Competitividad, La Paz 4807, Bolivia",University of Barcelona,"Herranz-Loncán, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist & Inst, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",alfonso.herranz@ub.edu,"Peres-Cajías, José Alejandro/O-6432-2019; Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso/L-2473-2014","Peres-Cajías, José Alejandro/0000-0002-9516-6825; Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso/0000-0002-4921-2640",Spanish Ministry of Economy [ECO2012-39169-C03-03]; University of Barcelona through the APIF; Catalonian Research and Universities Grant Agency,Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); University of Barcelona through the APIF; Catalonian Research and Universities Grant Agency,"This research has benefited from financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy through the project ECO2012-39169-C03-03; from the University of Barcelona through the APIF (2008-2012) fellowship program; and from the Catalonian Research and Universities Grant Agency through the BE-DGR-2011 fellowship program.

An important element of the paper is to show the nature, pace and direction of changes in the agrarian structure as well as development trends of farms in Poland and East Germany. The time scale of the study covers 2002-2010. The studies show that the agrarian structure in Poland is more fragmented than in Germany. Very small farms (1-5 ha) in northern and western Poland, which make up to 40.0% of the total, do not have the conditions for the efficient use of labour and an adequate income to keep a family and support development. Poland's adoption of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and the implementation of the Rural Development Programme (2007-13) influenced changes in farm size in northern and western Poland, and - above all - provoked a decline in the number of small farms (by 24%) while increasing average farm size (from 12 to 16 ha). Slow changes in Polish agriculture are the result of the clash of two forces. On the one hand, economic trends seek to concentrate farmland and make better use of its internal potential, while on the other, psycho-social trends put an emphasis on providing jobs in rural areas.","[Jezierska-Thole, Aleksandra] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Spatial Management & Tourism, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Jezierska-Thöle, A (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Spatial Management & Tourism, Torun, Poland.",,"Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/AAM-1967-2021","Jezierska-Thöle, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7607-9531",,,,,16,1,1,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,235.0,243.0,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700033,0

The purpose of this paper is to extend that debate by exploring how food advertising, a key source of consumer information about food, utilises and implies varied associations between food and mood. Design/methodology/approach - The research combines a textually oriented analysis with an analysis of the visual images in a sample of typical food advertisements drawn from women's magazines. Findings - Although healthy foods have the potential to enhance mood this is not often used as a key advertising message. Conversely, advertisements for foods that can depress mood frequently adopt messages of happiness and wellbeing. Research limitations/implications - This exploratory research provides an initial investigation of advertising discourses of food and mood at a snapshot in time. Based on the findings derived from this limited sample, further research is suggested which would provide a more comprehensive survey of food advertising. Practical implications - The research is of value to food promoters in suggesting that they review food messages and the use of emotional appeals in the light of developing scientific research on the link between food and mental wellbeing. Social implications - The growing interest in promoting mental health and wellbeing means that consumers and governments are keen to understand the relationship between food and mood and its potential influence on consumer food choices. Originality/value - This research indicates that some food advertising diverges from the scientific evidence on food and mental health and wellbeing. The research is therefore of value to food promoters and advertising regulators.","[Maddock, Sarah; Hill, Beverley] Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Maddock, S (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",sarah.maddock@uwe.ac.uk,,"Hill, Beverley/0000-0001-8597-4186",,,,,71,6,6,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Comparative study was adopted to dig the changes of consumers' preferences and habits. ANOVA was adopted to explore the statistically difference among consumers' behavior and preferences. Findings - The results indicate that Chinese consumers are rational-motivation-driven grape consumers, they prefer to sweet taste, seedless and medium priced grapes. Safety and quality characters (clean appearance, freshness and taste) were ranked as the most important grape attributes. As a whole, it was found that consumers are more quality-focussed and safety-conscious five years later, so some variances was showed in their purchase habits and preferences, such as the choice of purchase place, attitude to special grapes and willingness to pay to safe and genetically modified grapes.

Although empirical research suggests that strengthening RQ improves supply chain performance (SCP), most studies have focused on dyadic business relationships. To fully understand the relational behaviour of a firm embedded in a supply chain, we need to look beyond the dyad into triads. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how SCP is influenced by RQ in a triadic agribusiness supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Evidence is drawn from a quantitative survey of 150 agribusiness firms in the maize supply chain in Uganda. Data were collected in triadic context from 50 direct supply chains each composing of a supplier, focal firm and customer. Multi-group structural on SCP amongst the supply chain members. Findings - Results provides empirical support for the positive influence of RQ on SCP. SEM reveals differences in perception between the upstream and downstream and amongst the supply chains members. While focal firms considered conflict, coercive power, commitment and trust to be important; suppliers considered trust, dependency and non-coercive power; and customers considered trust, dependency and coercive power to be important RQ factors affecting SCP. Practical implications - For agribusiness managers to enhance business performance there is need to cultivate strong and mutual relationship with supply chain members. It is also important to know how to handle conflicts and use of power so as to realise the benefits of supply chain relationships. Originality/value - The paper is novel in that it assesses SCP in a triadic context in an agribusiness sector from a developing country context. The authors used novel approaches including analysis of a triad, and multiple groups SEM to assess perceptions of each supply chain member's.","[Odongo, Walter; Dora, Manoj; Molnar, Adrienn; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Odongo, Walter; Ongeng, Duncan] Gulu Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Rural Dev & Agribusiness, Gulu, Uganda; [Dora, Manoj] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Coll Business Arts & Social Sci, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Molnar, Adrienn] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Res Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary",Ghent University; Brunel University; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Odongo, W (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.;Odongo, W (通讯作者)，Gulu Univ, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Rural Dev & Agribusiness, Gulu, Uganda.",Walter.Odongo@Ugent.be,"Odongo, Walter/C-6258-2015; Molnar, Adrienn/AAK-2861-2020; Odongo, Walter/AAK-9690-2020; 穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022","Odongo, Walter/0000-0001-5811-5132; Molnar, Adrienn/0000-0002-3828-4198; Odongo, Walter/0000-0001-5811-5132; Dora, Manoj/0000-0003-4730-8144",Netherlands Organisation for International Cooperation in Higher Education [NICHE-UGA 083]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) supply chain and network performance and relationships in the agribusiness sector [PD 116226],Netherlands Organisation for International Cooperation in Higher Education; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) supply chain and network performance and relationships in the agribusiness sector(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"Walter Odongo is supported by a PhD fellowship from the Netherlands Organisation for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NICHE-UGA 083).

This conceptual paper argues that there exists an apparently powerful model in health behavior domain that may readily be brought into organic food purchase behavior research. The paper argues for domain relevance and proposes that Montano and Kasprzyk's integrated behavior model may readily be used in organic food behavior studies with some relevant modification. Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows an exploratory approach and shows how variables used in the past may be aggregated to the model in question. The challenge is addressed by following both the inductive and the deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning calls for investigating whether such behavior may be classified as health behavior. Inductive reasoning calls for proving relevance of all the variables in the aforesaid model to the organic food research context. Findings - The paper concludes that the Montano and Kasprzyk's model is theoretically relevant to the organic food behavior domain. However, it is observed that the domain-specific operationalization is necessary for further empirical studies. Research limitations/implications - Since the model was rarely tested empirically in predicting organic food purchase intention, the variable-specific relevance may not warrant the relevance of the whole model with intertwined relationships at the same time. Practical implications - The paper may pave a way toward further empirical research and may also explain the apparent intention-behavior gap as often reported in literature. Originality/value - The paper may provide a useful direction in future organic food purchase behavior studies by showing the domain relevance of an apparently powerful model, along with addition of some newer variables that may enrich the existing model.","[Rahman, Khandoker Mahmudur; Noor, Nor Azila Mohd] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Rahman, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia.",mahmud.edu@gmail.com,,"Rahman, Khandoker/0000-0002-8813-9044; mohd noor, nor azila/0000-0003-4570-6800",,,,,117,5,6,4,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Since the reform and opening up, the Chinese government has carried out seven times of larger institutional reforms, but some administrative agencies are still difficult to get out of the repeated vicious cycle of simplification and expansion.","[Tang, Jian] Chengdu Univ Technol, Engn &Tech Coll, Dept Management, Leshan City, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China",,"Tang, J (通讯作者)，Chengdu Univ Technol, Engn &Tech Coll, Dept Management, Leshan City, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China.",46851059@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,293.0,296.0,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200052,0

Using the theory of planned behaviour as the underlying basis, it is aimed to explain the effect of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behaviour control on consumption intention towards Dayak food. Since Dayak food is relatively unfamiliar compared to conventional food in Malaysia, food neophobia is incorporated into the model so as to assess its moderation effect on every postulated relationship. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach via self-administered questionnaire was adopted. In all, 300 copies of the questionnaire were distributed to non-Dayak Malaysians, and 211 usable copies were subsequently collected, suggesting that non-response bias was not a major issue. A post hoc Harman single-factor analysis was also performed to ensure the variance in the data was not explained by one single factor, thus addressing the common method bias. Structural equation modelling using partial least squares approach was then utilized to assess the relationships of variables under investigation and the moderation effect of food neophobia. Findings - After ensuring the data have acceptable reliability and validity, structural model assessment was performed to test the hypotheses. The findings show that attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control all have positive effect on consumption intention of non-Dayak Malaysians towards Dayak food. However, food neophobia is only found to have a moderation effect on the relationship between subjective norm and consumption intention. Research limitations/implications - First, the sample is largely consisted of college and university students in Malaysia who are believed to be more daring to try new things, including new food. Second and more importantly, the dearth of literature and empirical studies on Dayak food and ethnic food in Malaysia might have actually pointed to the limitation in using only quantitative questionnaire in the study. As salient beliefs are the antecedents in the theory of planned behaviour, knowing consumers' specific beliefs about Dayak food would have provided a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of consumption intention and the moderating effect of food neophobia. Practical implications - The moderation effect of food neophobia on the relationship between subjective norm and consumption intention towards Dayak food implies the importance of recommendations and favourable word-of-mouth from the significant ones, such as family members and peers, to make people willing to try and consume it. This corresponds to earlier findings pertaining to the collectivistic culture in Malaysia. Unlike countries with individualistic cultures, Malaysians tend to conform to the consumption choices of significant others. This implies that those whom they hold in high regard, are able to influence them both positively and negatively through their advice or opinions. Originality/value - The present study has not only extended the use of theory of planned behaviour in the context of Dayak food consumption intention in a developing country, but it has also deepened the theory by incorporating food neophobia as the moderator to provide additional theoretical explanation to ethnic food consumption intention. Given the wealth of Asian culture, and its significant role in the global marketplace, the understanding of ethnic food consumption intention of the local and foreign consumers using the extended theory of planned behaviour would contribute knowledge not only to consumer behaviour, but also to food and service industry and tourism.","[Ting, Hiram] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Borneo Studies, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [de Run, Ernest Cyril] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [Cheah, Jun-Hwa] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia; [Chuah, Francis] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Business & Management, Coll Business, Sintok, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak; University of Malaysia Sarawak; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Ting, H (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Borneo Studies, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia.",hiramparousia@gmail.com,"Cheah, Jun-Hwa/C-6463-2019; Ting, Hiram/P-3724-2015; Chuah, Francis/AAQ-9052-2020","Cheah, Jun-Hwa/0000-0001-8440-9564; Ting, Hiram/0000-0002-1389-976X; Chuah, Francis/0000-0001-7618-9338",[F01/(DRC)/1339/2016(3)],,"This paper is based on research at the Institute of Borneo Studies, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) under Dayak Chair Grant (Grant No. F01/(DRC)/1339/2016(3)).",,89,36,37,9,77,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They vary one from another lot. However, since customers in different product markets behave differently, the need to understand various customer behaviour models arises, and the following problem emerges - number of situations where inappropriate behaviour models are chosen for practical usage significantly increases. Therefore, the aim of the paper is - by identifying and evaluating most typical customer behaviour models, to understand how they differ from one another and explain better and more appropriate usage practice for different models. To achieve the aim, the authors have defined following tasks for paper: 1) to identify the essence and content of most popular customer behaviour model; 2) to assess strengths and weaknesses of each model by conducting expert interviews; 3) to determine practical application opportunities for each identified model; 4) to draw conclusions and make recommendations for practical usage of those models. Results show that classic five - stage model is most popular customer behaviour model in both - theory and practice. There are many attempts to provide improved versions of the model, yet they all are incomplete. Some critics and suggestions for alternative models are useful when dealing with specific products and markets. There are specific models created for such situations. These models, however, do not explain customer behaviour in other markets. Therefore, despite the critics addressed towards the classic five - stage model, it is still appropriate to use it in practice, and it works the best in conjugation with other market/product - level specified models.","[Viksne, Kaspars; Salkovska, Jelena; Gaitniece, Elina; Puke, Ieva] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Viksne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Salkovska, Jelena/AAV-8159-2021","Salkovska, Jelena/0000-0003-1328-0614",,,,,11,3,4,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,231.0,238.0,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200028,0

I review these contributions in the light of the implications for economic ontology, i.e. the question what the fundamental constituents of real world economic phenomena are. I argue in favor of the 'naturalization' of economic ontology, using the phenomenon of economic growth as my workhorse, and I explore the implications for the cross-disciplinary foundations of ecological economics. The paper shows how economic growth can be conceived as a 'natural' process that is driven by fundamental physical forces. The argument proceeds in three steps. After a short review of recent research on the linkage between energy and growth, I establish the connection with bioeconomic theories about evolution that allow restating the role of Lotka's Maximum Power Principle (MPP) as a property of open non-equilibrium flow systems with sufficient degrees of freedom of structural adaptation. The MPP is then related to the recent literature on Maximum Entropy Production (MEP), especially as deployed in the Earth Sciences. Economic growth can be seen as resulting from evolutionary adaptations of flow gradients in economic systems that increase throughputs of exergy and generation of work, and which thereby enhance the capacity of the Earth System to maximize entropy production. This framework offers fresh perspectives on a number of issues in research and policy, which I discuss in the conclusion.

Current uptake rates of AEA for montado conservation are very low. The study's main objective is to assess how varying the institutional-economic terms and conditions underlying current contract design can increase this uptake. We find demand for AEA inside and outside the currently designated protection areas, but there exist clear trade-offs between willingness to accept financial compensation and opportunity costs measured through varying cattle and oak tree density levels. Also contract duration plays a significant role. Minimum willingness to accept financial compensation for a hypothetical scenario representing the current contract conditions in the region is more than six times higher than the actual payment levels under the existing agri-environmental agreements.

However, despite a number of ESV-inspired sustainability initiatives since the 1990s, global ecological degradation continues to accelerate. This suggests that ESV has fallen far short of its goals of sustainable social transformation a failure which has generated considerable criticism. This paper reviews three prominent lines of ESV criticism: 1) the neo-Marxist criticism, which emphasizes the fictitious character of ecosystem commodities; 2) the liberal criticism through Friedrich Hayek's concept scientistic objectivism; and 3) the pragmatist criticism of value monism. Although each form of criticism provides insight into the limitations of ESV, all share ESV's inability to discern what kind of social transformation is possible. Unable to provide an account of their own immersion in social and historical context, these approaches operate in the hypothetical.

First, we develop a theoretical model emphasizing a substitution effect between seigniorage and deforestation revenues. Second, a panel-data econometric analysis over the 1990-2010 period confirms our findings. Consequently, a tighter monetary policy hastens deforestation. Third, we extend the theoretical model and show that international transfers dedicated to forest protection can upturn the positive link between tighter monetary policies and deforestation, and then discuss the relevance of this finding with respect to recent institutional arrangements.

However, typical IAMs do not explicitly represent the role of natural capital. In this paper, the DICE model by Nordhaus (2008) is expanded with a natural capital variable that is affected both by climate change and by depletive effects of economic activity. Due to a synergy between the two effects, the optimal policy of the expanded model features more and earlier abatement of CO2 emissions than DICE. Interestingly, the policy implications are different from what follows if one tries to capture the depletive effects on natural capital by simply reducing factor productivity growth in DICE. Acknowledging considerable uncertainty, simulations show that climate- and savings rate policies from the expanded model are more robust in the long term than policies that do not consider non-climatic depletion effects on natural capital.

Some of these challenges relate to differences in ontological commitments due to theory orientation of individual disciplines. Frameworks, understood as boundary objects, have been suggested as tools for dealing with this type of challenge. This paper investigates this capacity of frameworks taking Elinor Ostroms' SES-Framework as an example. To this aim, we developed a generic approach (the SES-TheOr approach) to promote disclosure and bridge differences in ontological commitments in SES research. We then applied it for examining the use of the SES Framework as boundary object within a small cross-disciplinary research team. We found that the SES Framework provided a useful common reference and starting point for discussing variables but could not fully deal with theory orientation. We conclude by suggesting that this may partly arise due to a tension between two competing SES Framework aims: on the one hand bridging differences in ontological commitments, and on the other hand ensuring a comparative function across cases.

It makes use of a new dataset comprising all patents granted in Italy in five benchmark years: 1864-5, 1881, 1891, 1902, and 1911. The following exercises are carried out. First, an examination is undertaken of the shares of independent, corporate, and foreign inventions and their evolution over time and across industries. Second, by exploiting the peculiarities of Italian patent legislation, which was characterized by relatively cheap fees and a flexible renewal scheme, the relative quality of independent and corporate patents is assessed. The results indicate that in Italy independent inventors made an important contribution to technological change in terms of number of patents, but the quality of their patents was significantly lower than that of firms and of foreign patentees.","[Nuvolari, Alessandro] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy; [Vasta, Michelangelo] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Siena,"Nuvolari, A (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy.",,"vasta, michelangelo/ABC-5933-2021; Nuvolari, Alessandro/F-3151-2011","Nuvolari, Alessandro/0000-0002-7275-4827; vasta, michelangelo/0000-0002-8683-8095",,,,,77,19,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

From the 1780s this innovation increased sailing speeds of British slave ships by about a sixth, prolonged the ships' lives by at least a half, and reduced the death rates of slaves on the middle passage by about half. It was, above all, the fall in death rates, and possibly the improved condition of surviving slaves, that made the investment so compelling. Copper sheathing may have paid for itself in a single voyage, even though it was usually good for several. By the 1790s few slave ships, even if making only a single voyage, were uncoppered. These results confirm that copper sheathing was one of the major improvements in shipping productivity before the use of iron and steam in the mid-nineteenth century.","[Solar, Peter M.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Solar, Peter M.] Vesalius Coll, Brussels, Belgium; [Solar, Peter M.] Univ St Louis Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Roennbaeck, Klas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; University of Gothenburg,"Solar, PM (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,53,18,19,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Important open questions concern the link between the stringency of protection and park effectiveness. How do mixed-use parks that allow sustainable extractive activities perform relative to strictly protected parks? And what types of mixed-use management perform best? In addressing these questions, it is particularly important to control for nonrandom siting, since different management regimes tend to be sited in areas with different preexisting characteristics. To date, most rigorous studies of this issue have focused on scores of parks in one or multiple countries, a strategy that in principle could be undermined by unobserved park heterogeneity. This paper uses high-resolution 2001-2006 land cover data derived from satellite images along with statistical techniques that control for nonrandom siting to examine the relative effectiveness of strict and various mixed-use protection strategies in a single large park: the two-million-hectare Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. Our results comport with the emerging consensus that on the whole, mixed-use protection in this park has been more effective in stemming deforestation than strict protection because of the performance of forest concessions within the multiple-use zone. However, we also find that mixed-use protection has had smaller, more heterogeneous effects than indicated by simple methods that do not control for nonrandom siting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The school district budget is allocated between the central administration and the constituent schools, who can spend these funds on personnel and non-personnel. We model this allocation problem as a network data envelopment analysis problem which solves for the technically efficient allocation of the budget within the district. The goal is to identify the allocation which yields the best aggregate performance for each school district in our sample. In our examination of 70 school districts in the Dallas, Texas area we find that test scores could be increased by approximately five normal curve equivalent (NCE) points by campuses reducing technical inefficiency and by an additional four NCE points by optimally reallocating the school district budget. Our illustrative model suggests that school districts could increase achievement test scores if more of their budgets were spent on campus personnel like teachers and less on non-personnel items like supplies, and if personnel resources were reallocated from the secondary to the elementary level. Furthermore, while the average school district in our sample allocates 21 % of their budget to the central office, our network model indicates that if resources were optimally allocated, the average school district would allocate only 16 % of their budget to the central office.","[Grosskopf, Shawna] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hayes, Kathy] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Taylor, Lori L.] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Taylor, Lori L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Weber, William] SE Missouri State Univ, Econ & Finance, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA",Oregon State University; Southern Methodist University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Grosskopf, S (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",shawna.grosskopf@orst.edu,"Taylor, Lori/AAH-2766-2019",,,,,,46,6,8,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Average commute time rises by 7.7 percent with each cross-sectional doubling of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) jobs. Using the RELU-TRAN structural computable general equilibrium model of the Chicago MSA, we simulate the equilibrium effects of a 24 percent population increase projected from 2000 to 2030 by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. If no new road capacity is added, then congestion per mile increases. Although the urbanized land area increases by 19 percent, indicating sprawl, the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per car-trip decreases by 1.31 percent and the VMT per car-trip to work decreases by 2.78 percent. Car travel time increases by only 6.25 percent and commuting time by only 4.54 percent, from 30.3 minutes in 2000 to 31.7 in 2030 or 3.4 seconds per year. We further explore the effects of new road capacity, gasoline prices, public transit speed, fuel economy gains, limits on suburban construction, and importantly, the cross-elasticity of public transit use with respect to car times. The availability of public transportation, economizing on nonwork travel, and land use adjustments that increase job-residence proximity keep times stable.","SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Anas, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, 415 Fronczak Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",alexanas@buffalo.edu,,,"United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2004 Science to Achieve Results (STAR) competition [RD-83184101-0]; Multi-campus Research Program and Initiative (MRPI) grant from the Office of the President, University of California [142934]","United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2004 Science to Achieve Results (STAR) competition; Multi-campus Research Program and Initiative (MRPI) grant from the Office of the President, University of California","The author acknowledges the support of research award RD-83184101-0 from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2004 Science to Achieve Results (STAR) competition, and the Multi-campus Research Program and Initiative (MRPI) 2009 grant from the Office of the President, University of California award number 142934.

The food production and processing is often not configured to supply agro-residues for production of bioenergy needed in food processing. The feasibility of utilising agro-residues through advances in postharvest technology for sustainable bioenergy conversion is reviewed. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Agro-residues from maize, sugarcane and potatoes in five African countries were assessed from secondary data to identify suitable conversion technologies, energy products and configurations of bioenergy plants for applications in postharvest food processing. Findings - Strategic alignment of postharvest technology to bioenergy production systems is vital to advancing both food production and bioenergy that benefit rural communities in Africa. High economic returns are possible when the bioenergy plants are either annexure to existing agro-processing operations or operate as a biorefinery. Research limitations/implications - Assessment of energy self-sufficiency of food production and processing systems is required. Practical implications - Agro-residues for bioenergy production require investments in infrastructure for storage, transportation and processing of the residues, and development of new risk management techniques. Social implications - The rural communities will be energy secure resulting in food security through reduced postharvest losses and increased agricultural productivity. Originality/value - The study stimulates innovative thinking in establishing sustainable bioenergy systems for food processes.","[Chimphango, Annie F.

Previous focus group research with minority consumers identified food handling and purchasing practices which might increase their risk for foodborne illness. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether practices identified in focus groups were common among a larger sample of the population. Design/methodology/approach - A survey including focus group-derived, culturally themed questions about food handling was developed and administered. Phone surveys were administered in English, Spanish, and Chinese from September-November of 2011 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Findings - Minority consumers were significantly more likely than Caucasian consumers (p < 0.05) to purchase live poultry and to purchase eggs unrefrigerated. Minority consumers were also more likely to report cooking offals and cooking a whole turkey overnight. Washing raw poultry was found to a prevalent behavior (85.7-89.1 percent) among Caucasians as well as minority consumers (95.0-97.9 percent). Research limitations/implications - This research surveyed consumers in a limited geographic area therefore results may not be generalizable to other geographic areas. Originality/value - The existence of unique unsafe food handling practices among minority consumers highlights the need for researchers to understand food handling practices of minority consumers in their countries. It also highlights the need to develop culturally appropriate safe food handling messages for immigrant and minority consumers. Additionally there is a need to better advise all consumers not to wash raw poultry.","[Henley, Shauna C.] Drexel Univ, Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Henley, Shauna C.] Univ Maryland, Family & Consumer Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Stein, Susan E.] Drexel Univ, Culture & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Quinlan, Jennifer J.] Drexel Univ, Nutr Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Drexel University; Drexel University,"Quinlan, JJ (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Nutr Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jjq26@drexel.edu,,,"USDA-CSREES [2009-51110-05853]; NIFA [2009-51110-05853, 581670] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA-CSREES(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This research was supported by USDA-CSREES grant: 2009-51110-05853.,,45,17,19,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using convenience sampling method. Initially exploratory factor analysis was performed to extract the key dimensions of service quality and then structural equation modeling was employed to verify the causal relationships between the dimensions of service quality and service quality itself. chi(2) test was used to determine whether any association exists between service quality or demographic variables and choice of channel types. Cramer's V was performed to measure the strength of association. One-way ANOVA was carried out to identify significant impact of demographic variables on perception of service quality. Findings - The research findings indicated that personal interaction, appearance, reliability, policy, and problem solving are the key determinants of service quality in terms of beverage industry in Bangladesh. It is observed that customers preferring factors like personal interaction and problem solving intend to purchase beverage items from super shop. Customers who are deemed socioeconomically high taking profession and monthly income into account prefer shopping at super shop. Customers who are female or married with no kid or service holders showed better satisfaction with service quality. Research limitations/implications - Due to money and time constraints the study could not cover up the whole country. Conclusions and predictions to be applied to consumers in general may not be appropriate entirely since specific age group was deemed, given that the subject was beverage products. Practical implications - The model proposed in this study will help managers and suppliers understand how consumers assess the quality of services. In order to strengthen brand and create brand loyalty, marketing planners, managers, and suppliers must be aware of the dimensions of service quality, and consumers' characteristics. Selecting an optimal sales channel is imperative for suppliers in order to make their products reach to target consumers. Originality/value - Service quality plays crucial role in ameliorating customer satisfaction and creating competitive advantage whereas sales channels have impact on sustaining the long-term profitability of the company. This paper has contributed significantly to these issues and sought consumers' characteristics and preference as well.","[Khudri, Md.

Since oil is the most important natural resource of the present day, we have focused on studying the role of oil in secessionist conflicts. For a conflict to be designated as secessionist, certain prerequisites have to be fulfilled: a region that has certain uniqueness and an identity felt by the majority of its population, different in some way from the rest of the territory that makes up the state. The identity that is different from the identity of the space surrounding the region can be a product of a different nationality, religion, culture and/or history. If this particular region is abundant with resources, chances for a secessionist conflict with resources playing a strong role i.e. a resource conflict that involves an attempt or attempts for secession (or at least a politico-territorial and economic autonomy) from the state rise significantly. Theoretical perspectives consulted for the purpose of this paper are mostly socioeconomic by their character. They are focused on the socio-economic aspects of the resource conflicts, and mostly quantitative. Secessionist conflicts represent a constant reality of the contemporary world. Interests of developed states and emerging economies, which lie in insuring the continuous, undisturbed flow of natural resources (oil and strategic minerals particularly) from the resource rich, albeit mostly poor and unstable countries represent an important factor of the prolongation of resource conflicts.","[Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Hunjet, Anica; Kozina, Goran] Univ North, Varazhdin, Croatia",University North - Croatia; University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; anica.hunjet@unin.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,35,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,74.0,84.0,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500009,0

Results shows that: most vegetable growers think that vegetable prices should rise and would continue to rise, and that vegetable prices would increase their revenue, thus in the coming year they would expand the planting scale of vegetable variety whose increase rate is the largest in this year. But because of the increase of logistics costs and production costs, some farmers benefit very little from the rising trend of vegetable prices. Most farmers expect too much in the trend estimation of the prices of vegetables and also lack of planning and forward-looking in production, thus the planting area of single variety is often decided by the market of previous year. According to analysis of the impact of the rise in vegetable prices on vegetable producer behavior, this paper gives the following suggestions to increase revenue of vegetable producers: change the mode of thinking, improve rural information platform, and increase capital investment for vegetable production base.","[Liu, Pan; Ma, Jinggui] Yangtze Univ, Coll Econ, Jingzhou 434023, Hubei, Peoples R China",Yangtze University,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Yangtze Univ, Coll Econ, Jingzhou 434023, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,4,15,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-2424,,,SHS WEB CONF,,,2015,17.0,,,,,,,,1011.0,10.1051/shsconf/20151701011,0.0,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1US,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358377900011,0

The authors therefore try to measure the effect of each quality attribute on consumer choice. Design/methodology/approach - As a theoretical basis, two principal quality attributes emphasised in the literature on consumer behaviour were analysed and adjusted to the specific fruit features. The empirical strategy was carried out by administering a telephone questionnaire survey of 270 interviewees who consume cactus pears in Italy. The questionnaire, consisting of 14 items expressed on a metric scale (five-point Likert scale), was used to rate the importance of cactus pear fruit quality attributes. An ordered logit model was employed for data analysis. Findings - The results show that consumption of cactus pear fruit is mainly based on credence and experience attributes, which have different effects on the consumer decision to consume cactus pear fruit. Among experience quality attributes, the colour red, a low quantity of seeds, and being peeled are the attributes with major effects, following by credence attributes such as environmental sustainability, healthiness, and Italian origin. Research limitations/implications - The research was based on a particular fruit, and further comparative research is clearly needed. In fact, further advancement in cactus pear research would require that the validity of the empirical findings and their degree of generalisation be examined in other geographical areas. Practical implications - The results of this study could help to identify some factors on which business could intervene to create a more effective consumer-based approach. Originality/value - This study contributes to a better definition of cactus pear fruit quality for consumers with the aim of developing marketing strategies to increase farm business. To the best of the knowledge, no study has ever measured the effects of cactus pear fruit quality attributes on consumer choice.","[Migliore, Giuseppina; Galati, Antonino; Romeo, Pietro; Crescimanno, Maria; Schifani, Giorgio] Univ Palermo, Agr & Forest Sci, Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Galati, A (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Agr & Forest Sci, Palermo, Italy.",antonino.galati@unipa.it,"Schifani, Giorgio/AIF-4239-2022; Migliore, Giuseppina/H-6334-2019; Galati, Antonino/H-5838-2012","Schifani, Giorgio/0000-0003-1055-929X; Migliore, Giuseppina/0000-0002-1889-0625; Galati, Antonino/0000-0003-0753-2934",,,,,72,29,32,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Tensions, fierce discussions and uncertainties in the political arena, prominent during vigorous and contentious election processes, divide the electorate between two main segments of Conservative Democrats and Secular Republicans with their own sub-groups. Those conditions obviously affect consumers like anyone else. Today, a consumer is not only an individual who benefits from the products and services provided. As a consequence of sharpened political fault lines and social polarization, rising economical welfare due to the growth of the middle class and rise of the social media due to the proliferation of the Internet, consumers of today are transformed into a constituency who perceive the corporations as political players and desire to grab the power and to peruse the brands as a means to express their own identities. In Turkey, under the circumstances described above, the brands have to determine their attitude and course of action very cautiously as soon as a new political etat des affaires emerge. Since the consumers perceive the brands as a vehicle to reflect their identity and being, they tend to be driven into polarization, express radical reactions and their attitudes and criticisms could get rough easily towards the brand. Vast majority yearn for and award neutral and unbiased brands that could haul them to the new situation. These expectations have pressured most corporate and brand managers for their way of action under the existing political situation and forced them to find methods to remove that restraint. Literature review show there are three possible approaches of attitudes and conducts the managers could adopt on corporation/brand-politics: (1) affirmation, (2) neutrality and (3) opposition. Managerial responses and current attitudes of opposing corporate and brand managers in the face of the current events as a new political situation arise, were evaluated. Corporate and brand managers have to understand current and potential customers' political behavior, attitudes and tendencies correctly, and have to analyze well the positive and negative possible outcomes of any of those three methods above and develop appropriate marketing and reputation management strategies. Otherwise, they will not be able to prevent the potential risk and negative consequences. In this context, the above-mentioned three executive responses are studied conceptually and theoretically. This study is an explanatory approach including the conceptual discussion on Brand-Politics. It aims to establish the subject matter and action path to prepare for future research, applications and comprehensive analyses and to provide further suggestions and a conceptual and theoretical scope. In an effort to establish within the conceptual scope, a) the conceptual foundations for brand-politics relationship; b) the methods for brand managers to tackle the problem; and finally c) the most possible feasible path; suggestions were aimed to be clarified in this study (by utilizing the existing albeit limited research available in literature). In the section where the findings are discussed, it has been suggested that corporate and brand managers, when they face the consumer, should not act on their own political standing or bias to benefit their long-term relation with the customers and the sustainable brand image they would create. In the context of three general executive attitudes possible, neutrality would be the most appropriate. In the relation between corporation (brand) and politics (ideology), to remain neutral and impartial would be the most suitable approach. Instead of a risky discourse and action in brand communications, marketing management should be able to see that non-discriminatory, funny, merry, free and all-embracing language is the most favorable and should be able to establish a mutual, circular, uninterrupted and interactive communications strategy using open, honest, and assuring content. Accordingly, the main suggestion: In a market where political polarization and tension is high and political bearings span a comparatively wide range, and where there is mass production and mass consumption like Turkey, corporate and brand managers should adopt a stance which would not allow the rise of current polarization has been presented, supported by other subsuggestions.","[Odabasi, Yavuz] Anadolu Univ, Eskisehir, Turkey",Anadolu University,"Odabasi, Y (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Eskisehir, Turkey.",yodabasi@anadolu.edu.tr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,66.0,73.0,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500008,0

It also compares the variation between global and local fast food chains as the products offered are culturally different. Design/methodology/approach - A variety of variables used to gain a holistic view, which includes factors such as quality, price, food and demographic profile of consumers affecting loyalty of fast food chains. The study adopts the theory and method of the trust-commitment-loyalty explanation chain and examines the consumer survey adapted from Fast food by Sahagun et al. (2014). The present analyses 542 filled questionnaires in which systematic sampling is used. Systematic sampling procedure is adopted. Findings - Indians prefer global fast food chains compared to Indian fast food chains. Loyalty towards global brands is higher than that for Indian brands because they are found to be of better quality which leads to higher frequency of visit and recommendation of the brands to their friends and colleagues. There are ethnic variations towards global and Indian fast food chains. Global brand of food chains generated more good word of mouth publicity compared to Indian food chains. Demographic factors play a role in the patronage of fast food chains. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this research is the study adapts the theory and method of the trust-commitment-loyalty explanation chain and examines the consumer survey adapted from a study of Sahagun et al. (2014) on fast food for emerging markets. Only India is studied, but the addition of other countries like Brazil, China, Russia and South Africa can add value. Practical implications - Fast food managers had to illustrate the satisfaction on affective response, such as quality of food, convenient location, variety, service and value for money. Demographic variables like gender, age, education, income and ethnicity, global and local Brand will affect the perceptions. Originality/value - This is the first attempt to study the loyalty of consumers in emerging markets, which is witnessing the entry of many fast food global chains. It studies the demographic variables effect on the loyalty and the behaviour of consumers and compares to local and global brand fast food chains.

It focuses on Botswana, a case where the post-independence diamond-led economy has been considered an economic success story, despite its high levels of inequality. Here it is argued that this pathway of rapid resource-driven growth combined with increasing socio-economic inequality had already started during the time of the colonial cattle economy, and that this older case is equally relevant for understanding long-term growth-inequality trends in Botswana and other natural-resource-dependent economies. Six social tables, covering the period 1921 to 1974, are constructed using colonial archives, government statistics, and anthropological records. Based on the social tables, income inequality is estimated in the colonial and early post-independence eras, capturing both the formal and informal sectors of the economy. The article demonstrates how the creation of a cattle export sector in the 1930s brought new opportunities to access export incomes, and how this led to a polarization in cattle holdings and increasing income inequalities. Further, with the expansion of colonial administration, government wages forged ahead, increasing income inequality and causing a growing income divide between public and private formal employment.","[Bolt, Jutta] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Hillbom, Ellen] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",University of Groningen; Lund University,"Bolt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",,"Hillbom, Ellen/AAU-6436-2020","Hillbom, Ellen/0000-0002-0820-2729",Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Hillbom acknowledges funding and contributions from colleagues within the Swedish Research Council sponsored project 'Tracing the institutional roots of economic development: the impact of colonial extraction'.

To allow for changes in relative prices, GDP benchmark years in national accounts are periodically replaced with new and more recent ones. Thus, a homogeneous long-run GDP series requires linking different temporal segments of national accounts. The choice of the splicing procedure may result in substantial differences in GDP levels and growth, particularly as an economy undergoes deep structural transformation. An inadequate splicing may seriously bias the measurement of GDP levels and growth rates. Alternative splicing solutions are discussed in this paper for the particular case of Spain, a fast-growing country in the second half of the twentieth century. It is concluded that the usual linking procedure, retropolation, is seriously flawed as it tends to bias GDP levels upwards and, consequently, to underestimate growth rates, especially for developing countries experiencing structural change. An alternative interpolation procedure is proposed.","[Prados de la Escosura, Leandro] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Prados de la Escosura, Leandro] CEPR, London, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"de la Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;de la Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",leandro.prados.delaescosura@uc3m.es,"de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/H-9476-2015","de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/0000-0002-2362-4305",ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,9,9,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2016,10.0,3,,,,,251.0,275.0,,10.1007/s11698-015-0131-4,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DR9NS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380224000001,0

An analysis of a 12-year panel of the U.S. technology hardware and equipment industry illustrates the usefulness of the proposals. Findings reveal wider gaps between better and worse performers following economic distress.

It demonstrates that Denmark's take-off at the end of the nineteenth century was relatively energy dependent. This is related to Denmark's well-known agricultural transformation and development through the dairy industry, and thus the article complements the literature which argues that expensive energy hindered industrialization, by arguing that similar obstacles would have precluded other countries from a more agriculture-based growth. The Danish cooperative creameries, which spread throughout the country over the last two decades of the nineteenth century, were dependent on coal. Although Denmark had next to no domestic coal deposits, this article demonstrates that Danish geography allowed cheap availability throughout the country through imports. On top of this it emphasizes that another important source of energy was imported feed for cows.","[Henriques, Sofia Teives] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Sharp, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",Lund University; University of Southern Denmark,"Henriques, ST (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,"Teives Henriques, Sofia/HNT-0686-2023; Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019","Teives Henriques, Sofia/0000-0002-3175-8370; Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106",Carlsberg Foundation; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Per Boje, Ingrid Henriksen, Morten Hviid, Peter Sandholt Jensen, Astrid Kander, Markus Lampe, Hana Nielsen, Bent Sorensen, Paul Warde, and participants at conferences and seminars where we have presented this work for helpful comments and suggestions.

While it is crucial to demonstrate that such environmental flows produce the desired hydro-ecological results, allocation of environmental water is also influenced by perceived social values of this water. This research draws on the sub-field of socio-hydrology to track two-way feedbacks between humans and environmental flows and shows why and how social responses to river restoration can be monitored. Media coverage, posted comments and in-person interviews were used to track the responses of stakeholders who 'chased' the progress of the 2014 pulse flow down the Colorado River. These data framed in the cultural ecosystem systems typology revealed the temporal patterns and dynamics of dramatic shifts in socio-hydrologic processes and highlight the value of understanding the human wellbeing benefits and complex social values that are affected by freshwater restoration. This experimental and mixed evidence approach is useful for contexts where multiple stakeholders shape water resource management and we suggest it can be used by water decision-makers in their efforts to understand and appropriately respond to the social-ecological dynamics of a changing river system.

In most regions, producers of pollinator dependent crops end up benefiting because direct output losses are outweighed by increased prices, while non-agricultural sectors experience large adverse indirect impacts, resulting in overall losses whose magnitudes vary substantially. By comparison, partial equilibrium analyses tend to overstate the costs to agricultural producers, understate aggregate economy-wide losses, and overstate the impacts on consumers' welfare.

First, the liveability of modern cities depends to a large extent upon urban and ped-urban ecosystems and their services. Second, these services are not only a gift of nature, but co-produced by human labour. Ecosystem services, in other words, are not just natural; they are also the outcome of historical, political, economic and social endeavours. We support our case with a study of the city of Barcelona and the adjacent Collserola Natural Park. Through an inter-disciplinary project combining biophysical, historical, and archival research, interviews and activist research we show that, first, the liveability of Barcelona highly improves because of the services provided by the ecosystem of Collserola. Second, that Collserola was not originally a pristine forest; it became one after agricultural abandonment institutional interventions and the action of social movements. If ecosystem services are co-produced by human action, and social struggles, as we argue is the case of Collserola, then this has implications for the ways ecological economists think about ecosystem services, their value and valuation. Whereas the social production of ecosystem services may seem an obvious and intuitive idea, it certainly challenges the foundational aspects of monetary valuation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The received empirical literature on the measurement of productive efficiency has paid relatively little attention to the difference between these two components. Ahn and Sickles (Econ Rev 19(4):461-492, 2000) suggested some approaches that pointed in this direction. The possibility was also raised in Greene (Health Econ 13(10):959-980, 2004. doi:10.1002/hec.938), who expressed some pessimism over the possibility of distinguishing the two empirically. Recently, Colombi (A skew normal stochastic frontier model for panel data, 2010) and Kumbhakar and Tsionas (J Appl Econ 29(1):110-132, 2012), in a milestone extension of the stochastic frontier methodology have proposed a tractable model based on panel data that promises to provide separate estimates of the two components of efficiency. The approach developed in the original presentation proved very cumbersome actually to implement in practice. Colombi (2010) notes that FIML estimation of the model is 'complex and time consuming.' In the sequence of papers, Colombi (2010), Colombi et al. (A stochastic frontier model with short-run and long-run inefficiency random effects, 2011, J Prod Anal, 2014), Kumbhakar et al. (J Prod Anal 41(2):321-337, 2012) and Kumbhakar and Tsionas (2012) have suggested other strategies, including a four step least squares method. The main point of this paper is that full maximum likelihood estimation of the model is neither complex nor time consuming. The extreme complexity of the log likelihood noted in Colombi (2010), Colombi et al. (2011, 2014) is reduced by using simulation and exploiting the Butler and Moffitt (Econometrica 50:761-764, 1982) formulation. In this paper, we develop a practical full information maximum simulated likelihood estimator for the model. The approach is very effective and strikingly simple to apply, and uses all of the sample distributional information to obtain the estimates. We also implement the panel data counterpart of the Jondrow et al. (J Econ 19(2-3):233-238, 1982) estimator for technical or cost inefficiency. The technique is applied in a study of the cost efficiency of Swiss railways.","[Filippini, Massimo] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland; [Greene, William] NYU, Dept Econ, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; New York University,"Filippini, M (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Filippini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland.",mfilippini@ethz.ch,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,34,135,136,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Specifically, it examines the consensus-making politics, in the case of negotiating historical responsibility within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In doing so, analytical concepts from the discourse theory of Laclau and Mouffe are utilized to look for rationales that underpin discursive structures as well as agreement. To conclude, three rationales have dealt with conflicts over historical responsibility. While the first rationale hid conflict behind interpretative flexibility, the second reverted to reasoned consensus, excluding perspectives commonly understood as political rather than scientific. The third rationale has enabled equivocal use of the concept of historical responsibility in several parallel discourses, yet negotiators still stumble on how to synthesize these with a potential to foster future, more policy-detailed, consensuses with higher legitimacy. Understanding the history and current situation of negotiations on historical responsibility from this perspective can help guide policy makers toward decisions that avoid old pitfalls and construct new rationales that generate a higher sense of legitimacy.","[Friman, Mathias] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Friman, Mathias] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Friman, Mathias] Linkoping Univ, Water & Environm Studies, Dept Themat Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Linkoping University,"Friman, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",mathias.friman@liu.se,,,Formas [2011-779]; Swedish Energy Agency [P35462-2]; Swedish Energy Agency (SEA) [P35462-2] Funding Source: Swedish Energy Agency (SEA),Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Swedish Energy Agency (SEA)(Swedish Energy Agency),"This work was supported by Formas (grant no. 2011-779), and the Swedish Energy Agency (grant no.

Specifically, we examine whether (1) strong legality mandated by a treaty such as precisely stated obligations, strong monitoring/enforcement mechanisms, and dispute resolution procedures, and (2) high domestic constitutional hurdles such as requirements for explicit legislative approval deter countries from ratifying a treaty. To test our theoretical claim, we use a new time-series-cross-sectional dataset that includes information on the ratification behavior of 162 countries with respect to 220 MEAs in 1950-2000. We find that treaties that are characterized as 'hard' indeed deter ratification.

Our main finding is that it was not necessarily the broad structure of corporate ownership that mattered for performance, but whether family blockholders had a governance role. Large active blockholders tended to increase operating performance, implying that they reduced managerial expropriation.

Exploiting a fixed-effects model that relies on within-county variations, relative to the corresponding changes in other counties, I find that while individuals are likely to experience worse self-reported mental health when local house prices decline, this association is most pronounced for individuals who are least likely to be homeowners. This finding is not consistent with a prediction from a pure wealth mechanism but rather with the hypothesis that house prices act as an economic barometer. I also demonstrate that the association between self-reported mental health and local house prices is not driven by unemployment or foreclosure.

This is commonly referred to as the horsemeat scandal. The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers' preferences across Europe for a selected ready meal, ready to heat (RTH) fresh lasagne, to consider whether the effects of potential food frauds on consumers' choices can be mitigated by introducing enhanced standards of RTH products. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was administered to 4,598 consumers of RTH lasagne in six European countries (Republic of Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Norway), applying discrete choice experiments to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for enhanced food safety standards and highlight differences between countries. Findings - Many similarities across countries emerged, as well as some differences. Consumers in Europe are highly concerned with the authenticity of the meat in ready meals and strongly prefer to know that ingredients are nationally sourced. Strong regional differences in price premiums exist for enhanced food safety standards. Originality/value - This research adds relevant insights in the analysis of consumers' reaction to food fraud, providing practical guidelines on the most appropriate practices that producers should adopt and on the information to reduce food risk perception among consumers. This would prove beneficial for the food processing industry and the European Union. The survey is based on a representative sample of European consumers making this the largest cross-country study of this kind.","[Agnoli, Lara] Grp ESC Dijon Bourgogne, Sch Wine & Spirits Business, Dijon, France; [Capitello, Roberta] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy; [De Salvo, Maria] Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Catania, Italy; [Longo, Alberto] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Global Food Secur, Gibson Inst, Sch Biol Sci,UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth NI, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Longo, Alberto] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Pais Vasco, Spain; [Boeri, Marco] RTI Int, Hlth Preference Assessment Grp, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Boeri, Marco] Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth NI, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Verona; University of Catania; Queens University Belfast; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Research Triangle Institute; Queens University Belfast,"Boeri, M (通讯作者)，RTI Int, Hlth Preference Assessment Grp, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.;Boeri, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth NI, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",mboeri@rti.org,"DE SALVO, MARIA/F-6460-2014; Agnoli, Lara/H-5347-2019; De Salvo, Maria/AAR-9115-2021; De Salvo, Maria/AFW-2130-2022; Boeri, Marco/D-9656-2011; Capitello, Roberta/K-5605-2015","DE SALVO, MARIA/0000-0001-6328-7254; Agnoli, Lara/0000-0003-1136-8014; De Salvo, Maria/0000-0001-6328-7254; Boeri, Marco/0000-0001-7346-2132; Capitello, Roberta/0000-0003-0530-9085","EC; Framework Programme 7 [289262]; UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Northern Ireland MRC [MR/K023241/1]; Financial Aid Programme for Researchers of BIZKAIA: TALENT Transportation Policies: Emissions Reductions, Public Health Benefits, and Acceptability; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52587-R]; MRC [MR/K023241/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_CF023241, MR/K023241/1] Funding Source: researchfish","EC(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Framework Programme 7; UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Northern Ireland MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Financial Aid Programme for Researchers of BIZKAIA: TALENT Transportation Policies: Emissions Reductions, Public Health Benefits, and Acceptability; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This research is part of the output of the project STARTEC - Decision Support Tools to ensure safe, tasty and nutritious Advanced Ready-To-Eat foods for healthy and vulnerable Consumers, funded by the EC, the Framework Programme 7 (Grant No: 289262).

Currently, most food safety education is delivered through reading materials. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of food safety education utilizing three interventions: PD, personal story reading and reading standard material. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 89 pregnant women and 93 people with diabetes received food safety information through one of three intervention methods: PD, reading standard educational material (Standard) and reading material presented in a story format (Story). A survey assessed self-reported risk and food safety knowledge and personal hygiene before and after the interventions. Take-home assignments allowed participants to practice recommendations. Post class interviews and survey assessed knowledge gained and reported behavior change. Findings - Compared to those who merely read educational information, participants in a PD Intervention had higher knowledge scores and adopted more safe handling recommendations. Involvement of the participants and the length of information exposure likely contributed to the significant difference between the interventions. This suggests that food safety education is most effective when delivered in a supportive discussion format. Health education programs for these vulnerable groups should endeavor to deliver safe food handling guidelines through a PD approach. Originality/value - Previous research demonstrated the effectiveness of PD when delivering nutrition education. This is the first paper that explored the effectiveness of a PD intervention in delivering safe handling recommendations.","[Feng, Yaohua; Bruhn, Christine] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Food & Sci Technol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Marx, David] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Feng, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Food & Sci Technol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",yhfeng@ucdavis.edu,,"Feng, Yaohua/0000-0003-3012-1930","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2012-68003-30155]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, under award number 2012-68003-30155.",,39,12,14,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The duty would allow to capitalize on the consumption of these products as well as limiting the consumption itself. However, this excise duty can cause several complications such as financial pressure on not-well-off households. Placing the excise duty on products would consequently increase the price of the product, which would in turn increase the sales revenue of cross border trade. Recent studies have discovered that the consumer react to increased prices of the domestic product, by purchasing the goods in other countries to minimize his/her expenditures. Since the prices of grocery products are already higher than in the neighbouring countries - Lithuania and in specific cases Estonia, this increase in the price could cause the shopping abroad to become a really hot topic. Since the excise duty is a custom administrated tax, there has to be extra control on Russian and Belarus borders, as well as informing the general public about which products the excise duty has been imposed on. If the imported product exceeds the allowed quantity, these products should be taxed separately. Since the excise duty is a consumption tax, it will directly affect lower income citizens, as they spend the majority of their income on grocery products. The process will expand the income inequality in Latvia even more, despite the fact that it is already one of the highest in the European Union.","[Juruss, Maris; Seile, Elza] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Juruss, M (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",,"Seile, Elza/JTU-8190-2023; Juruss, Maris/JMR-3805-2023","Juruss, Maris/0000-0002-4022-5031",,,,,17,0,0,1,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,266.0,273.0,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200032,0

The two companies will get zero profits if they make price according to the principle that market price is equal to marginal cost. If there is different in marginal cost of the two companies, one of them will occupy the whole market so long as the marginal cost is lower than the other's. Results show that only the two companies compete with each other at a reasonable price, change the development strategy of the cash subsidies, and seek new business model to make profit.

This paper focus on the problems of psychological distress, reasons and thoughts during the process of power rent -seeking of leading cadres, and its purpose is to wish everyone to pay enough attention to the psychological distress that power rent seeking brings to leading cadres and explore the root of corruption.","[Tang, Jian] Chengdu Univ Technol, Engn &Tech Coll, Dept Management, Leshan City, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China",,"Tang, J (通讯作者)，Chengdu Univ Technol, Engn &Tech Coll, Dept Management, Leshan City, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China.",46851059@qq.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,297.0,300.0,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200053,0

Railway construction often required financial support from local governments, which depended on their fiscal capacity. However, since the main government revenues were trade-related, this generated a two-way feedback between government revenues and railways, with a potential for multiple equilibria. The empirical tests in this article support the hypothesis of such a positive two-way relationship. The main implication of our analysis is that the build-up of state capacity was a necessary condition for railway expansion and also, to a large extent, for export expansion in Latin America during the first globalization.","[Bignon, Vincent] Banque France, Paris, France; [Esteves, Rui] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",European Central Bank; Bank of France; University of Oxford; University of Barcelona,"Bignon, V (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,"Esteves, Rui/JWO-4978-2024; Bignon, Vincent/JYP-2587-2024; Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso/L-2473-2014","Esteves, Rui/0000-0002-1966-7214; Herranz-Loncan, Alfonso/0000-0002-4921-2640",,,,,110,17,19,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Over the very long run, the Canadian forestry sector was not immune from the negative effects of commodity price volatility. However, the long run averages mask dynamic and asymmetric patterns in the sector's responses to price volatility. The supply of investment funds from formal-external sources was suppressed during episodes of high and rising commodity price volatility, but insensitive to low and falling volatility. These effects weakened as the economy matured. The accumulation of reproducible and natural capital was affected by commodity price volatility through an investment supply channel that was also asymmetric, but in this case, the effect was strongest during low and falling volatility. These results show how a maturing economy with diversified investment opportunities can become increasingly immune from the negative effects of commodity price volatility.","Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Keay, I (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",ikeay@econ.queensu.ca,,,SSHRC [410-2007-0323]; Corporate Policy and Portfolio Coordination Branch of Natural Resources Canada,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Corporate Policy and Portfolio Coordination Branch of Natural Resources Canada,"I would like to thank Andre Bernier, Herb Emery, Richard Hornbeck, David Jacks, Frank Lewis, Gregor Smith, and Jeffrey Williamson for taking time to comment on earlier versions of this paper.

Yet some fundamental questions about parish-level provisioning remain hard to answer. These include the amount that people received from the parish, from all sources, each week; how the balance between types of payments shifted over the period, and (correspondingly) within the individual life-course; the range of services or supplements that such individuals received, from the parish, over the course of their lives; and how this spectrum of relief adjusted to the massive macro-level changes that we know occurred in the poor relief system between the 1760s and 1834. This study attempts to answer these questions in new depth, by employing a dataset that encompasses all payments to named individuals within the Essex parish of Terling between 1762 and 1834, totalling 143,801 payments to 1,508 recipients. Analysis of this dataset provides new insights into the size, scope, changes, and significance of poor relief in labouring families' lives in southern England in this period.","Univ Exeter, Hist, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"French, H (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Hist, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",,,"French, Henry/0000-0002-5101-4782",British Academy [SG091025],British Academy,"Research for this article was funded by a British Academy Small Grant SG091025.

Yet, the causal evidence is lacking because there may well be omitted variables that cause individuals to attain more education and also cause individuals to be environmentally conscious. We implement a regression discontinuity design to estimate the increase in educational attainment due to changes in compulsory education laws in 20th century Europe. This allows us to overcome the identification problem of endogenous educational attainment. Using two waves of Eurobarometer surveys, we find a positive local average treatment effect for 7 of the 8 pro-environmental behaviors. An analysis of related questions on the survey supports the notion that education causes individuals to be more concerned with social welfare and to accordingly behave in a more environmentally friendly manner.

The index has the proper homogeneity properties of a total factor productivity index. One input, cost, and six output categories of the main service activities carried out by tax offices, are specified. A bootstrap approach is applied to establish confidence intervals for the individual indices enabling an identification of units that have significant productivity decline, growth, or no change. A novel visual test groups units into these three possible categories. This way of showing consequences of uncertainty should facilitate more tailor-made policies to promote efficiency and productivity improvements. Productivity changes are distributed from a 26 % decline to a 35 % increase over the three-year period with an average growth of 4 %. Inspecting individual unit results, the confidence intervals tend to be wider the larger the units, thus providing more accurate insights than point estimates for actions to improve productivity. Looking at positive and negative changes in cost and productivity together the development of offices is classified into four categories of interest to policymakers; efficient cost increase, efficient cost saving, inefficient cost saving, and inefficient cost increase.","[Forsund, Finn R.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Forsund, Finn R.; Kittelsen, Sverre A.

We argue that two main patterns of population movements are evident. In food-deficit areas, a search for food security typically led to large net inflows to main urban centres. By contrast, an urban exodus dominated in food surplus regions because the chief risk was to personal safety, especially from Japanese and Allied bombing. Black markets were ubiquitous, and essential to sustaining livelihoods in cities with food-deficit hinterlands. In Rangoon and Manila, wartime population fluctuations were enormous. Famines in Java and northern Indochina severely impacted Jakarta and Hanoi through inflows of people from rural areas. In most countries, the war's aftermath of refugees, revolution, and political disruption generated major rural-urban population relocations. Turmoil in the 1940s had the permanent consequences of augmenting the primacy of Southeast Asia's main cities and promoting squatter settlement.","[Huff, Gregg] Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Huff, Gillian] Univ Oxford, Dept Hist, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Huff, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-062-23-1392]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005389/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Campbell Leith for comments and owe a considerable debt to three anonymous referees for extensive and detailed comments.

B. Haas; Knowledge,,"Many global environmental agreements have shown diverse changes in their long-term implementation. Comparative studies on international regimes are limited, and research on change in such regimes is not well developed. A comparative typological study of change in global environmental regimes is presented in this paper. Ernst B. Haas's three models of change is chosen as a framework to explain change in the regimes. The models are (1) incremental growth, (2) turbulent nongrowth, and (3) managed interdependence. They reflect the shift of power balance among member states and their knowledge of policies. The models are applied to five case studies covering the Ramsar, CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna), Basel, Ozone, and Climate regimes, which have been in effect for over 15 years. The three models help explain diverse changes in those regimes. Five factors, (1) shift of power balance and political leadership, (2) the scope of the regime (narrow or wide), (3) institutional legacy, (4) consensual knowledge and conflict of political value, and (5) learning between rival groups, have made major contribution to the change in those regimes.","Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan",University Shiga Prefecture,"Kamigawara, K (通讯作者)，Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, 2500 Hassaka Cho, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan.",2t95f6@bma.biglobe.ne.jp,,"Kamigawara, Kenji/0000-0002-5704-6603",,,,,40,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We perform this analysis for several European countries (France, Germany, UK, and Spain) and the USA, extending Coe and Helpman's (Eur Econ Rev 39:859-887, 1995) empirical specification to include human capital. We use a new dataset of patents data for the past 150 years to calculate the stock of knowledge using the perpetual inventory method. Our time series empirical analysis confirms the heterogeneous relationship between innovation variables (domestic stock of knowledge, imports of knowledge, and human capital) and productivity. Our results reveal the extent to which observed differences in technology adoption patterns and the levels of endowment of such resources can explain differences in TFP dynamics across countries. The estimated coefficients confirm the considerable gap that still exists between the European countries and the USA in innovation-related variables. Furthermore, we obtain a finding that may have important implications for innovation policies: the higher the levels of human capital and domestic knowledge stocks, the higher will be the response of TFP to a 1 % increase in any of the aforementioned variables.","[Sanchis, Teresa; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.; Esteve, Vicente; Cubel, Antonio] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchis, Teresa] Inst Figuerola, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] ERI CES, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Sanchis, T (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",m.teresa.sanchis@uv.es,"Esteve, Vicente/B-1507-2010; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./K-8923-2014; Cubel, Antonio/Q-9397-2018","Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./0000-0001-9664-4668; Cubel, Antonio/0000-0002-0722-4934","Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Economicas; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2011-25033, ECO2011-30323-C03-02, ECO2012-39169-C03-02]; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) [ECO2011-30260-CO3-01]; Fundacion Seneca-Regional Agency of the Regional Government of Murcia [15363/PHCS/10]; Generalitat Valenciana [GVPROMETEO2009-098, PROMETEO/2009/068]; Department of Education and Science of the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha [PEII09-0072-7392]; GLOBALEURONET program from the European Science Foundation",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Economicas; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad)(Spanish Government); Fundacion Seneca-Regional Agency of the Regional Government of Murcia; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Department of Education and Science of the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha; GLOBALEURONET program from the European Science Foundation,"Financial support from the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Economicas, the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Projects ECO2011-25033; ECO2011-30323-C03-02; and ECO2012-39169-C03-02), MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Project ECO2011-30260-CO3-01), Fundacion Seneca-Regional Agency of the Regional Government of Murcia (Project 15363/PHCS/10), the Generalitat Valenciana (Project GVPROMETEO2009-098), the Department of Education and Science of the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha (Project PEII09-0072-7392), and the Generalitat Valenciana (Project GVPROMETEO2009-098 and PROMETEO/2009/068), and the GLOBALEURONET program from the European Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

We investigated Danish forest owners' preferences for conditional contracts for the provision of ecosystem services in Natura 2000 policies in a sample covering 12.5% of the total private forest area. This involves allowing old trees to decay naturally, setting aside forest areas, accepting a fixed percentage of broadleaves and increasing access for the public. Forest owners may already provide some of these, e.g., if they derive private benefits from them, in which case additionality becomes an issue. This study investigates the link between forest owners' current management and their willingness to accept (WTA) payments for providing specific ecosystem services by eliciting current practice prior to a choice experiment on contracts. For most of these ecosystem services, owners differentiate their WTA significantly according to their current management. Owners who did not provide extended access had a mean WTA of (sic)14/ha/year for accepting access up to 15 m from roads and paths and (sic)28/ha/year for accepting access everywhere in their forest. However, forest owners who already allow extended access have a mean WTA around zero. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is conducted using secondary data from Euromonitor International. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has been calculated for analyzing the market trends in terms of type, category and prime positioning and market competition has been analyzed using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Analysis of variance has been used for analyzing the statistical difference in market competition. Findings - Consumer purchase behavior for food is significantly changing across the world and consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the health enhancing properties of food. With growing incidences of problems like obesity, diabetes, coronary heart diseases and foodborne diseases, consumers are becoming aware of the role of food in ensuring health and well-being. There have been significant structural changes in the health and wellness food market compositions and India has huge market potential for health and wellness food products with a market size of Rs. 435 billion in 2013 and growing at a significantly high annual growth rate of about 13.8 percent during 2002-2013. HHI results clearly indicate that there is significant competition in the health and wellness food market with average HHI of 0.19. However, the structure of market competition shows a varied trend across the types, categories, prime-positioning and distribution channels of health and wellness food products. Practical implications - Results of the study provide a better understanding of temporal as well as intra-category changes in market size of health and wellness food products and the competitiveness of the health and wellness food market, providing valuable insights to the companies involved in producing and marketing of health and wellness food products in India.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the Portuguese knowledge and attitudes towards seafood and relate it to consumers' environmental conscious. Design/methodology/approach - Using an internet-based survey the authors investigated the relation of socio-demographic variables to consumption frequency and how knowledge about seafood is associated with interest in different information when purchasing seafood products. Findings - Results demonstrate consumption of a high diversity of species. Tuna and cod are the top species related to convenience and food traditions. There is a preference to consume seafood mostly at home and prepared grilled. Differences between higher and lower knowledgeable consumers' related to seafood, show that the first ones have a more diversified use of species and high prevalence of small pelagic fish. Research limitations/implications - The findings are influenced by the sample obtained, which over-represents well- educated and higher income people. Moreover the self-reported consumption can be biased by individuals own perceptions and different seafood products. Better estimations of consumption frequency could result from asking more detailed information, as such as by species or meal occasions. Practical implications - Portuguese consumers have high knowledge about seafood but it is not necessarily related to sustainable choices. To help in sustainable seafood choices it might be more effective to promote existing habits based on Portuguese traditions that still are good alternatives for the marine environment.

Design/methodology/approach - The survey was conducted on 220 consumers in different food outlets (supermarkets and local fishmongers) during their purchases of fish. Only those who have already had experience of eating or handling and preparing a freshwater fish were selected for the study. Findings - According to result of factors analysis test, the low consumption of freshwater fish is linked to three factors: sensory barriers (28.54 percent), convenience barriers (22.83 percent) and quality barriers (19.65 percent). These factors explained about 71.04 percent of the total variance of the research variables. Sensory attributes constitute a major barrier for freshwater fish consumption. Most consumers revealed that freshwater fish has a muddy-earthy taste, bad texture, unpleasant appearance and with numerous bones. Not surprisingly, convenience orientation is cited as a barrier by the most respondents. They reported that freshwater fish will require more effort, time and/or skills at different stages of the provisioning process which includes acquisition, preparation, eating and cleaning up. Quality attributes (place, freshness and knowledge about freshwater fish) has also an influence on fish's value and acceptance. It is considered a negative characteristic of freshwater fish. Originality/value - Little is known on consumer attitude toward barriers of fish consumption in Morocco. This study is a preliminary one investigating the barriers affecting consumer purchasing decision of freshwater fish.","[Badr, Laamiri Mohamed; Ahmed, Yahyaoui] Mohamed V Agdal Univ, Dept Biol, Rabat, Morocco; [Salwa, Oufrid] Chouaib Doukkali Univ, Dept Biol, El Jadida, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat; Chouaib Doukkali University of El Jadida,"Badr, LM (通讯作者)，Mohamed V Agdal Univ, Dept Biol, Rabat, Morocco.",laamirimb@gmail.com,,"yahyaoui, ahmed/0000-0001-7469-0639",,,,,48,9,9,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the fascia brand of a retail chain has the power to positively or negatively skew prevailing opinions concerning the quality of its own merchandise range, beyond the set of product-specific intrinsic benefits. Design/methodology/approach - A within-subject two-phase research design was adopted, intially using an experimental approach and thereafter modeling the cognitive effect with the inclusion of a moderator variable (brand interaction). Paired sample t-tests were used to assess differences in mean ratings and partial least squares analysis was implemented in order to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - In the experiment phase, both products were rated equally at the outset in unsighted conditions, however, ratings diverged when brand name was introduced. Here, the high-end private label brand was scored considerably better than in its unsighted condition, while the low-end brand suffered a marginal decline in rating. In the modeling phase, two iterations of the conceptual model were run, considering the high-end and low-end brands seperately. The results were mutually reinforcing. A strong relationship, significant at the one percent level, was found to exist between brand name and perceived quality for both the lower-and higher-end brands, whereas no moderation effect was found to exist. This suggests that entrenched views of the brand strongly determine the perceived quality thereof, with operational and day-to-day fluctuations having little bearing on this. Research limitations/implications - This study focusses solely on South Africa, an emerging market within the BRICS consortium. To this end, the results are not transferable to other markets. The context of the study pitted a top tier retail brand against a mid tier retail brand. In accordance with this eventuality, lower income consumers, and retail chains catering to this market segment, do not constitute components of this particular study. Originality/value - While the relationship between store image and perceived quality of private label merchandise is well documented, this study considers the effect through an experimental design. Here, perceived quality was measured both with and without brand cues evident. Thus, the results are likely to be more accurate than those acquired through strictly survey research. As a defining feature, the study points to the brand name as being a supremely powerful extrinsic cue, and hinting at the fact that it is long term influences that create a distinct brand aura, with these being largely undisturbed by short term fluctuations.","[Beneke, Justin; Trappler, Emma] Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Beneke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",justin.beneke@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,82,3,3,7,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 200 children (ages eight to 11), half with ADHD and the other half healthy, participated in the study. A three-day food consumption record was taken and evaluated based on energy and macro-micro nutrient requirements. Weight, height, waist, hip, mid-upper arm circumferences and hand grip strength were measured. Findings - Energy, protein, fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrate, niacin and zinc intakes were found significantly lower than healthy controls for female participants and all nutrient intakes were found significantly lower than healthy controls for male participants ( p < 0.05). Children with ADHD had lower anthropometric measures (p > 0.05). Research limitations/implications - The study sample size was too small to make results general and subtypes of ADHD and medication types were disregarded during the data collection process which limited the interpretation of the study results. Originality/value - There are only a few researches about nutritional status of children with ADHD in Turkey. In this study, the authors found that children with ADHD have inadequate and unbalanced diet. Because of this result it is important to evaluate and monitor the nutritional status and habits of children diagnosed with ADHD for a healthy growth and development.","[Energin, Esma] Ankara Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Rakicioglu, Neslisah] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ankara, Turkey; [Kilic, Birim Gunay] Ankara Univ, Sch Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University; Hacettepe University; Ankara University,"Energin, E (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Dept Nutr & Dietet, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",esmaenergin@hotmail.com,"Kılıç, Birim Günay/V-9691-2019; Asil, Esma/AAF-8031-2020; Asil, Esma/E-5494-2017","Kılıç, Birim Günay/0000-0002-4566-2564; Asil, Esma/0000-0003-0809-4008; Rakicioglu, Neslisah/0000-0001-8763-7407",,,,,40,0,0,0,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive analysis (DA) was conducted using trained panelists. Acceptability was measured by consumers, researchers and experts. The results of DA and acceptability were analyzed using partial least square regression. Findings - There was no strong relationship among the three groups in their rating patterns for the samples (r = -0.342-0.445). The liking factors for each group were as follows: consumers (rice cake flavor and moisture), researchers (wet wood flavor and whiteness) and experts (wet wood flavor and size of rice). The disliking factors for each group were as follows: consumers (wet wood flavor and brown particle), researchers (moisture) and experts (old rice aroma). The consumers, researchers and experts seemed to have different acceptances and key descriptive attributes for aseptic-packaged cooked rice. Research limitations/implications - The consensus by researchers during the product development process required caution with regard to the fact that the evaluation by the researchers could be different from what consumers or experts prefer.

First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in practice. Over half of the 153 billion of estimated global pollination service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with.

The huge problem of Lithuanian crop insurance system is the low rate of farmer's participation and problems arising in defining insurance premiums. However, there are noticeable substantial climate changes during the last 20 years, and agricultural sector in future will be more affected by unfavourable climatic conditions and such natural disasters require the Government to provide assistance to farmers. The amount of insurance premiums for crop insurance are relatively high, because a single Insurance Company does not accumulated sufficient statistics, so farmers rarely use its services: now there are insured only 7% of insurable crop areas in Lithuania. Consequently, negotiating takes place between farmers, Insurance Company and Government concerning compensation for crop yield losses. The aim of paper is to analyze the advanced experience of other countries, to evaluate principles of crop insurance in order to give proposals for all negotiating parties. Methods of the investigation are comparative analysis of the problem, descriptive approach, synthesis, modeling. The results and conclusions of the paper suggest to modify the principles of crop insurance driving to, low-premium,, wide coverage system, to increase the transparency of damage evaluation and payment of insurance claims and to be more focused on trends of climate change in future.","[Peleckis, Kestutis; Peleckiene, Valentina; Peleckis, Kestutis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Peleckiene, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",Valentina.Peleckiene@vgtu.lt,"Peleckienė, Valentina/JXN-9424-2024",,,,,,8,4,4,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-187-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,37,,,,,15.0,25.0,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360011300001,0

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, data were collected from steakhouse consumers using a convenience sample (n = 386). Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the survey data. Findings - The results reveal that service-brand awareness and brand image produce considerably dissimilar effects on consumer-perceived food value and risk. Brand awareness positively affects consumer-perceived food value but does not influence perceived physical risk. By contrast, brand image negatively influences perceived physical risk and positively affects brand preference, but it does not add perceived value to the food product.

This may raise global awareness on their importance in macro-and micro-economics. Design/methodology/approach - The relationship of FRs with human life was analyzed through literature review to illustrate their real value. Association of FRs production with the probability of becoming a high income country was estimated by analyzing the relevant data published by FAOSTAT, World Bank and United Nations to illustrate their value in macro-economy. Analyzing the interrelationship of prices with their attributes through literature review and the correlation of the relevant data published by FAOSTAT and OECD was undertaken to create a mathematical model for pricing FRs. Findings - The real value of FRs is unaccountable, which makes their economic value (price) be not always determined on market. Increase in the probability of becoming a high income country with increase in FRs production indicates that their shortage may bottleneck macro-economic development. A mathematical model has been created for estimating the economic value of FRs. Practical implications - These findings are applicable for managing (or administrating), pricing or evaluating FRs, analyzing their economic status, developing business and predicting tendency in micro-economy.

We first demonstrate a new set of conditions for the identification of agents' time preferences. Then we prove conditions under which the per-period utilities are identified for all actions in the agent's choice-set, without having to normalize the utility for one of the actions. Finally, we develop a computationally tractable semiparametric estimator. The estimator uses a two-step approach that does not use either backward induction or forward simulation. Our methodology can be implemented using standard statistical packages without the need to write specialized computational routines, as it involves linear (or nonlinear) projections only. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate the superior performance of our estimator compared with existing two-step estimation methods. Monte Carlo studies further demonstrate that the ability to identify the per-period utilities for all actions is crucial for counterfactual predictions. As an empirical illustration, we apply the estimator to the optimal default behavior of subprime mortgage borrowers, and the results show that the ability to identify the discount factor, rather than assuming an arbitrary number as typically done in the literature, is also crucial for obtaining correct counterfactual predictions. These findings highlight the empirical relevance of key identification results of the paper.","[Bajari, Patrick] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bajari, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chu, Chenghuan Sean] Facebook, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Park, Minjung] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Bureau of Economic Research; Facebook Inc; University of Virginia; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bajari@uw.edu; seanchu@gmail.com; denis.nekipelov@gmail.com; mpark@haas.berkeley.edu,"Park, Minjung/R-7774-2017","Park, Minjung/0000-0002-5693-9370",,,,,50,12,12,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We find them compatible and their output more comprehensive compared to traditional valuation based on one value perspective. The public participatory softGlS survey delivers information on the perception of urban green spaces, which we use as a criterion for dividing green space categories in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the perception expressed in the survey is generally consistent with the impact on property prices in the case of formal green spaces. However, it is inconsistent when it comes to informal ones: places identified as lacking well-maintained greenery exert a positive influence on property prices, while positively evaluated informal green spaces had no impact at all. We identify the latter as a typical trade-off between different value perspectives: informal green spaces are perceived differently following a monetary and a non-monetary approach.

We review or method through a comparison to existing aesthetic value mapping approaches and verify the results through a comparison to a revealed landscape preferences indicator. Disagreenient between the methods arises from many factors, including the type of ecological/landscape features that are assumed to contribute to the provision of aesthetic values, the use of context-specific or generic aesthetic value estimates, the scale of landscape evaluation and the level of integration of the landscape preference analysis. We argue that the approach presented here is a suitable generically applicable methodology for context-sensitive mapping of aesthetic landscape values for a number of reasons: (i) a careful and transparent selection process of landscape attributes, (ii) the use of primary preference data, (iii) an integrated evaluation of landscape attributes introducing trade-offs between specific features in the agricultural landscape and (iv) application of visual landscape scale manipulated photographs for the elicitation of preferences as a surrogate for a real landscape experience.

But relatively little empirical work has quantitatively examined how land-use fragmentation, population density and compactness determine individual wellbeing. We analyse the relationship between these aspects of urban structure and life satisfaction in 33 cities distributed across five OECD countries. We create a unique dataset merging a household survey on environmental attitudes and behaviours in these countries with geospatial data on a number of indicators related to urban structure. In support of standard urban economic theory, we find a life satisfaction trade-off in terms of households' home sizes and distances to the urban core. A novel finding from the analysis is that the degree of local land-use fragmentation around households' residence is associated strongly and negatively with life satisfaction. We also find suggestive evidence that city centralization (the relative proportion of the population living in the core) decreases life satisfaction on average for individuals residing both within and outside the core.

Institutional interaction within the MEA system raises issues of environmental policy integration (EPI), i.e. balancing different environmental objectives and considerations. Mainstream proposals for enhancing EPI in environmental governance build upon the assumption that environmental institutions are fragmented. However, recent research reveals that the MEA system has been defragmenting over the years such that EPI is less a problem of institutional fragmentation than of effective management of institutional interplay. This paper examines the factors affecting EPI among MEAs by looking at experiences in the cluster of biodiversity-related multilateral agreements. The analysis is based on a series of interviews with MEA secretariat officials and international experts conducted between September 2011 and January 2012. The paper identifies institutional, political and cognitive barriers constraining interplay management efforts. While some have proposed regulatory changes in the cluster, national-level co-ordination appears to be the best way to advance EPI.","[Velazquez Gomar, Jose Octavio] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Gomar, JOV (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ee08jovg@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,13,15,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Considering that there is a lack of studies about green purchase behavior and its determinants in all European Union countries (EU), the aim of this paper is to evaluate the main determinants of green purchase behavior by applying the Theory of Planned Behavior. Referring to Hostefe's cultural dimensions we revealed how cultural aspects contribute to purchase behavior. The results showed that there were observed big differences in terms of green purchase behavior in the EU countries and it did not depend on economic development significantly. The subjective norms and interaction of knowledge and confidence in green products significantly determined the green purchase behavior in all countries. According to the cross-culture studies, all cultural dimensions did not have significant influence on green purchase behavior. However, cultural dimensions are related to factors which directly influence green purchase behavior. Therefore, due to the process of the EU cultural convergence and economic crisis, it could have indirect impact on green purchase behavior. These findings have important implication for marketers and policy makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article reassesses the role of the loans issued with the support of the League of Nations. These long-term loans constituted the financial basis of the League's strategy to restore the productive basis of countries in central and eastern Europe in the aftermath of the First World War. In this article, it is argued that the League's loans accomplished the task for which they were conceived because they allowed countries in financial distress to access capital markets. The League adopted an innovative system of funds management and monitoring that ensured the compliance of borrowing countries with its programmes. Empirical evidence is provided to show that financial markets had a positive view of the League's role as an external, multilateral agent, solving the credibility problem of borrowing countries and allowing them to engage in economic and institutional reforms. This success was achieved despite the League's own lack of lending resources. It is also demonstrated that this multilateral solution performed better than the bilateral arrangements adopted by other governments in eastern Europe because of its lower borrowing and transaction costs.","[Zendejas, Juan H.

The structure of the Electoral College concentrates spending in battleground states, such that a majority of voters are ignored. We estimate an equilibrium model of multimarket advertising competition between candidates that allows for endogenously determined budgets. In a Direct Vote counterfactual, we find advertising would be spread more evenly across states, but total spending levels can either decrease or increase depending on the contestability of the popular vote. Spending would increase by 13 % in the extremely narrow 2000 election, but would decrease by 54 % in 2004. These results suggest that the Electoral College greatly increases advertising spending in typical elections.","[Gordon, Brett R.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hartmann, Wesley R.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University,"Gordon, BR (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Hartmann, WR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",b-gordon@northwestern.edu; wesleyr@stanford.edu,"Gordon, Brett Russell/KCX-9518-2024","Gordon, Brett Russell/0000-0001-9081-569X",,,,,46,14,21,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this context variable message signs (VMS) play a major role in providing drivers with useful information during their trips. In this paper we consider the problem of finding the optimal location of a set of portable VMS on an urban network where flow patterns change during a time horizon. We propose two original solving approaches based on flow intercepting facility location ILP models. The paper presents an application of the proposed approaches to real-like test networks and discusses the results obtained providing some indications on their practical applications.

It promises to give respondents a better basis for decision-making by exposing them to a more diverse set of knowledge, arguments and opinions through group discussion. However, under certain conditions, small groups may fail to effectively pool the individual knowledge of their members. This paper examines the impact of the initial distribution of individual preferences in discussion groups on the outcome of deliberative choice experiments. Drawing on a deliberative monetary valuation study of forest ecosystem services in West Saxony, Germany, it is shown that the initial preference distribution in groups influences both the diversity of arguments exchanged during group discussions and respondents' consideration of the costs of environmental policies. Furthermore, results indicate that respondents' post-discussion willingness-to pay is affected by the initial preference distribution in groups, though these changes were not statistically significant. The choice certainty of respondents was found to remain largely unaffected. Overall, the empirical findings of this study provide preliminary evidence about the need to conduct future deliberative monetary valuation studies with groups with heterogeneous initial preferences as this may provide respondents with a more complete set of decision-relevant information.

The empirical study focusses on small Finnish food companies that export to German and Chinese markets. Design/methodology/approach - The research method of this study is qualitative. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews with six respondents presenting exporting companies and export consultants. Findings The paper provides an empirical contribution to the food internationalization debate. First, the paper discusses the definitions of export intermediaries and their role in export based on the literature. Second, by examining how Finnish food companies experience the role of export intermediaries, the paper contributes to the current discussion on internationalization modes. The empirical results highlight that export companies need transaction -creating services from intermediaries especially when entering physically and culturally distant markets like China. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the research generally relate to the use of a small case sample. Practical implications The paper holds a number of relevant insights for food companies seeking to enter to German and Chinese markets. Identifying the export services needed by small food companies might help export intermediaries a.nd public policy agencies to better focus their supporting initiatives. Originality/value - The findings add to the current body of knowledge on the key influence on internationalization modes within the food sector.","[Lehtinen, Ulla] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Management & Int Business, Oulu, Finland; [Ahokangas, Petri] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, SF-90100 Oulu, Finland; [Lu, Jinghui] Oy Nord Node Ltd, Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Oulu,"Lehtinen, U (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Management & Int Business, Oulu, Finland.",ulla.lehtinen@oulu.fi,"Ahokangas, Petri/AAH-9632-2021","Ahokangas, Petri/0000-0002-2351-8473",,,,,55,9,9,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The intent is also to understand the function of packaging as a marketing tool. The outcome of the study is expected to contribute to the link between packaging and marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach - The case study method was chosen in order to assess and investigate how packaging can be used in marketing. The study focuses on narrating the use of packaging for different customer applications and the unit of analyses was the packaging product. In order to analyse the five sub-cases or corporate stories a cross-case analysis was used and the analysis of data was carried out in different stages. This approach treats each sub-case as a separate entity and the analysis reveal both similarities and differences among the sub-cases. Findings - The present study demonstrates that packaging has become an important tool in marketing of different products either this is for end-consumers, or customers in a supply chain. This has become more essential as more products are introduced on a market. The study shows the significance of linking packaging to marketing strategy. An important ingredient for that is the use of packaging design for differentiation purposes. The results support also that packaging has become an essential factor for a secure and efficient distribution in a food supply chain. In addition, packaging and packaging design is contributing to value creation for different actors in a food supply chain. Practical implications - The managerial implication from the case study shows that packaging can be used together with the product concept to create a competitive offering in a market. This gives managers the possibility to differentiate their products from competitive offerings by using packaging and packaging design in a creative manner. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for contributions to more research on packaging and marketing strategy.

Previous research on CCs experiences from different countries provided evidences about social capital improvement, introducing CCs as sustainability tools. This research uses the theoretical frameworks of social capital and complex adaptive systems to approach concepts like sustainability, networks, trust, norms, participation and cooperation. Statistical analysis of the data collected in June 2013 through online survey explores social capital and resilience indicators among the Spanish exchange community users, conduding that Spanish CCs systems improve community social capital through the proposed dimensions, although they are in an early stage and several weakness need to be corrected. The values, motivations, attitude and positive perception of their members suggest that CCs could be appropriate tools for sustainability due its potential to improve social capital and resilience. Detected weakness may affect the interests and commitment of their members. Therefore experience from senior currency systems may help them to face adversities and fully develop their potential for sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Associative entrepreneurship - collective action - has been proposed as a scheme that would bring cleaner technologies to miners, in order to reduce the harmful effects of using mercury in the gold recovery. In this paper we investigate the extent to which miners can establish and sustain an association that aims to fulfill these goals. This is done by conducting a framed experiment with small-scale gold miners in Colombia. We test the effect of two institutional arrangements on associative entrepreneurship; exclusion and co-management. We found that miners made contributions that did not allow a sustained acquisition of the technology. However, we found that under co-management players could achieve long-lasting and efficient levels of individual contribution; but, conversely, exclusion did not trigger this kind of collective action. Policy implications of our results and avenues for further experimental research are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While the trend towards private standards established by developed country or 'Northern' actors has received significant attention in the literature, recently an emergent counter-trend can be observed which manifests in the development of standards by Southern producer country actors. This may be attributed to the perceived lack of legitimacy of global standards, especially from a Southern perspective. The paper therefore applies a legitimacy perspective to analyse the emergence of new Southern standards in Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil, Brazilian soy and South African fruit production. The analysis reveals that Southern standards both target different audiences to obtain legitimacy and rely on different sources of legitimacy as compared to established Northern standards. This is done explicitly in order to create cognitive and moral distance to Northern standards and ultimately to reclaim the issue areas occupied by Northern standards. The paper discusses and reflects on the implications of the emergence of Southern standards for sustainability governance and concludes with the identification of future research opportunities on Southern standards.

In recent years, several sets of urban sustainability indicators and indices have been developed. However, only a few consider the complex multi-scale interactions between the urban activities and the environment. Furthermore, most existing indices use a relative evaluation approach instead of an absolute approach that is needed when dealing with ecological thresholds. The paper introduces a new urban biophysical sustainability index whose framework includes: the city environmental quality, use of natural resources, and GHG emissions. Each contains topics for assessment related to local, regional and global scales and associated indicators. Standard and optimum values were determined for each indicator and a formula is provided for grading each indicator measurement. The integration of those grades allows for generation of a compound score of each topic, category, spatial scale and the entire urban biophysical sustainability performance. It then demonstrates the index in three major Israeli cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present a novel empirical analysis using interviews and Q Methodology to examine how conservation practitioners and organisations are interpreting and using ES concepts and associated approaches. We find that these concepts are being adopted for instrumental imperatives to broaden constituencies and with an expectation of extending funding sources. We uncover concerns within conservation that the utilitarian emphases of ES concepts may compromise the ability to make non-utilitarian arguments for nature in the future. In relation to changing practice, we examine shifts in partnerships and funding, where ES ideas provide a shared language about flows of value, apparently accelerating the integration of conservation and the private sector. Whilst many respondents noted the significance of shifts related to ES ideas, some attempted to play these down, presenting their organisation's adoption of these ideas as just a rhetorical tool'. However, we argue that the adoption of ES concepts cannot be presented as solely rhetorical, given that these increasingly underpin and inform planning tools and policy instruments.

These developments will also limit access to common-pool resources (CPRs). This study uses the sustainable livelihoods framework to identify the conditions under which a development strategy will improve livelihood outcomes in the region. Analysis of original household survey data, in-depth interviews, and field observation reveals that households depend on CPRs for a range of market and non-market benefits. Low-income households depend on CPRs for up to 60% of their total income. OLS regression estimates show that households in villages farthest from market centers have a higher income dependence on CPRs and are more likely to participate in forest use activities. A majority of households report that there are few available substitutes. To improve livelihood outcomes, a development strategy should secure access to market benefits from CPRs, or wage income must increase in proportion to lost CPR income and affordable substitutes must be provided. Access to non-substitutable components of CPRs must be secured, and the distribution of changes in access to natural capital and new wage opportunities must be accounted for. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the idea that volunteerism and satisfaction with the programme's outcome are two important components of the programme's viability, we successively analyse the intensity of households' participation in the programme and their reported satisfaction with its economic achievement, which we relate to their stated volunteerism. We show that households' participation intensity in the SLCP is primarily driven by land and location characteristics, and that these findings hold true whether or not the households voluntarily enrolled in the programme. Moreover, as far as participants' satisfaction can be interpreted as an indicator of potential long-term support for the programme, our findings also support plausible sustainability for the programme.

Consequently, the long debated question of whether or not foreign aid enhances economic growth and efficiency in resource use received renewed attention. However, consensus has still eluded researchers and policy makers. In spite of numerous studies, there is little evidence of a significant positive effect on the long-term growth of poor countries. While most previous studies have relied on simple cross country regressions, this study suggests a new approach, evaluating country performance in a production theory context using productivity as a measure, applying the non-parametric Malmquist Productivity Index and then linking this country performance to amount of foreign aid received. A balanced panel of 89 low and middle income countries from five different geographical categories is studied over a period of 11 years. By use of a novel visual test the countries are grouped into three categories, significant productivity decline, growth or no change. The different categories are based on confidence intervals resulting from bootstrapping. When linking country performance to aid in a more traditional way, a significant, but weak correlation is found.","Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Veiderpass, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",Ann.Veiderpass@economics.gu.se,,,,,,,30,4,5,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

However, using social transfers as an indicator of redistribution and three alternative proxies for inequalitythe top income shares, the ratio of the GDP per capita to the unskilled wage, and the share of non-family farmsthis article shows that inequality did not favour the development of social policy between 1880 and 1930. On the contrary, social policy developed more easily in countries that were previously more egalitarian, suggesting that unequal societies were in a sort of inequality trap, where inequality itself was an obstacle to redistribution.","[Espuelas, Sergio] Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Barcelona, Spain; [Espuelas, Sergio] Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Espuelas, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Barcelona, Spain.",,,"Espuelas, Sergio/0000-0003-1771-6307",Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Campmany; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2009-13331-C02-02]; Xarxa d'Economia i Politiques Publiques,Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Campmany; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); Xarxa d'Economia i Politiques Publiques,"I am very grateful to Alfonso Herranz for his valuable comments and advice.

A handful of studies can be found in the discrete choice literature that take this dependency explicitly into account at the estimation stage. But there is only limited research that investigates how the choice complexity affects the efficiency of the choice design. In this research we propose choice designs in order to estimate the heteroscedastic mixed logit model which is parametrized to model the preference heterogeneity as well as the scale heterogeneity due to the choice complexity. The heteroscedastic model assumes that the scale factor is an exponentiated linear function of some complexity measures. An increase in choice complexity leads to an increase of the error variance, hence of the choice inconsistency. We generate sequential designs, heterogeneous semi-Bayesian designs and homogeneous semi-Bayesian designs considering and ignoring the choice complexity. This way we can examine the advantage of taking the choice complexity into account at the design stage in each design approach. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential design which takes the choice complexity into account outperforms all other designs we considered. It turns out that the sequential approach generates choice sets with a constant, relatively low complexity level. As the respondents can easily cope with these choice sets, they give consistent choices and these choice sets appear to be most informative about the individual preferences.","[Danthurebandara, Vishva; Yu, Jie; Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Vandebroek, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",Vishva.Danthurebandara@kuleuven.be; Jie.Yu@kuleuven.be; Martina.Vandebroek@kuleuven.be,"Vandebroek, Martina L./J-9103-2015","Vandebroek, Martina L./0000-0002-0317-1986",,,,,26,3,4,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered from 1,698 consumers of a supermarket chain in the northeast region of the USA using a web-based experiment. Findings - Results of this study support the superiority of a positively framed message over a negatively framed message in persuading consumers to buy organic food. In addition, this effect of framing on persuasion is contingent upon different levels of consumer purchase-decision involvement as well as PCE concerning organic products. Practical implications - This study offers managerial implications for marketers and retailers, messages appealing the environmental and health benefits of organic seafood consumption (positively framed arguments) would be more persuasive to increase consumer purchase intention than negatively framed ones. In addition, individual characteristics of their target market should be taken into account in communication design and implementation. Originality/value - This survey research offers insights into the organic food consumption literature by validating the applicability of message framing in the organic seafood labelling setting and identifying consumers' individual characteristics (purchase-decision involvement regarding organic seafood and PCE) moderating the message framing effectiveness.","[Cucchiara, Courtney; Kwon, Soyeon] Purdue Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ha, Sejin] Univ Tennessee, Dept Retail Hospitality & Tourism Management, Knoxville, TN USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Ha, SJ (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sha5@utk.edu,"Ha, Sejin/AAZ-9778-2021","Ha, Sejin/0000-0001-7915-7286",,,,,53,19,23,5,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main results from this research - not all of the countries interpret the concept of internal control in the same way - some countries have special independent internal control institutions, in some countries, decentralised system of internal control is embedded and forms an integrated part of the administration. More and more countries also require top managers to apply systems for managing or mitigation of the risk of not achieving set objectives.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on USDA healthy eating standards, a menu comprising seven healthy and seven unhealthy meal options were presented, once unlabeled as control (n = 214) and once labeled with healthy and non-healthy nutrient icons as an intervention test menu (n = 212). Findings - Findings demonstrate that despite a positive observed trend, there were no significant differences between healthy selection of labeled and unlabeled dishes (p = 0.16). Practical implications - Providing nutritional information in student cafeterias may be challenging but helpful. However, more strategies need to be developed with student input to provide nutrition data on menus in an informative, comprehensive, yet friendly way that encourages healthy eating in campus foodservices. Social implications - No labeling system or legislation can control choices made by individuals, so the responsibility for a healthy selection must always remain personal. However, consumers should have input on menus as they have a stake in the outcome of the products. Originality/value - This novel study tested a student-designed menu to assess whether user input can influence food choice.","[Feldman, Charles H.; Brusca, Joseph; Zhao, Hang] Montclair State Univ, Dept Hlth & Nutr Sci, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Hartwell, Heather] Bournemouth Univ, Int Ctr Tourism & Hospitality Res, Foodserv & Appl Nutr Res Grp, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Su, Haiyan] Montclair State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Montclair, NJ USA",Montclair State University; Bournemouth University; Montclair State University,"Feldman, CH (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Hlth & Nutr Sci, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",feldmanc@mail.montclair.edu,,"feldman, charles/0000-0002-1742-7831",,,,,48,7,8,1,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews of a cluster random sample of meat-purchasing consumers in Taiwan. The study data are analysed in light of grounded theory, to provide a clearer understanding of interviewees' sustainability concerns arising from meat consumption. Findings - Results indicate that consumers do make meat-purchasing decisions based on to their sustainability concerns, and that there are a wide variety of such concerns, which can be broadly categorised as food security, animal welfare, and the environment. These implicate a variety of factors including ways of selling (e.g. fresh or frozen), the provision of information about production methods, certification, and traceability. By comparing consumers in supermarkets and traditional markets, the paper identifies divergent perspectives on food security in the context of local dining culture, and concludes that trust is a significant factor influencing purchasing behaviour. Originality/value - Prior research about consumers' meat-purchasing habits and sustainability concerns is limited and de-contextualised. The present findings have implications for future communications to consumers, in that greater emphasis should be given to the local cultural contexts of food. It will be valuable to academics, livestock producers, consumer organisations, and policymakers interested in enhancing communication and trust between and among producers, consumers, retailers and government agencies.","[Jen, Meng Yuan] Wageningen Univ, Educ & Competence Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wang, Shun-mei] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Environm Educ, Taipei, Taiwan",Wageningen University & Research; National Taiwan Normal University,"Jen, MY (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Educ & Competence Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",mong0418@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,3,4,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As consumers' opinion is very important in identifying development strategy for food industry it seems justified finding out if geographical region had an influence on consumers' opinion. Furthermore, this is the topic that is still under researched. The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers' perception of functional food (FF) relative to geographical region. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire based survey was conducted on a representative national sample with participants aged 18 and older (n = 687). Participants were divided according to their place of residence taking into account difference in dietary habits, which created two geographical sets: Coastal (Adriatic) Croatia and Continental Croatia. Data were analyzed using univariate statistics and multivariate analysis as exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Findings - The results indicate that Croatian consumers are familiar with the term FF and that there are significant differences between two geographical sets of respondents (Coastal Croatia and Continental Croatia) in their willingness to pay for FF. Furthermore, research showed that there is a general lack of confidence in the information provided on the product labels especially in the continental region. The results have shown that taste and price quality ratio are the most important features in choosing the FF and are equally important to the consumers' in both geographical region. Practical implications - Research results indicate a need for development of consumers' confidence and need to focus mainly on educating consumers in label comprehension. This is particularly true for the Continental Croatia. Targeted advertising should take into account consumers' preferences, confidence and label comprehension according to their geographical regions. Originality/value - The case study represents consumers' opinion coming from different geographical regions (Coastal Croatia and Continental Croatia) regarding FF. In this research the most important attributes in choosing the FF were extracted.","[Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos] Univ Zagreb, Dept Proc Engn, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Lab Measurement Regulat & Automatisat, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Cacic, Jasna] Croatian Assoc Drink Producers, Zagreb, Croatia; [Misir, Andreja] USDA, US Embassy Zagreb, Foreign Agr Serv, Buzin, Croatia; [Cacic, Drazen] Croatian Agr Extens Serv, Velika Gorica, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Cacic, J (通讯作者)，Croatian Assoc Drink Producers, Zagreb, Croatia.",jasna.cacic@giupp.hr,"Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/AAD-2935-2021; Misir, Andreja/AFQ-4878-2022","Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/0000-0001-6657-7337; Misir, Andreja/0000-0002-2023-4117",,,,,52,22,22,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted through an online questionnaire distributed at Bath Spa University. The approach included asking respondents why they watched programmes featuring celebrity chefs; to select a named celebrity chef whom they thought had most influenced their food habits, and to name particular chefs relating to campaign descriptions. Findings - A significant proportion of the study group watched television programmes fronted by celebrity chefs (84 per cent); the main reason for watching was for entertainment. Overall, reported influence was insignificant, though Jamie Oliver was selected as the chef with most influence on the respondent's food habits. Jamie Oliver's campaign to improve school dinners was also the most recognised, and celebrity chefs were generally viewed positively. Research limitations/implications - The study population was quite specific in its gender, age and ethnicity, and therefore might not be representative of wider society. Further work could consider gender differences in chef influence, as well as different forms of exposure. Originality/value - Despite their ubiquity, academic research into the role of the celebrity chef in modern society is limited, where very few studies have assessed the influence of named chefs or the public perception of these figures. This paper gives an insight into this under-researched field.","[Lane, Samantha Rosemary; Fisher, Stephanie Margaret] Bath Spa Univ, Dept Sci, Bath, Avon, England",Bath Spa University,"Lane, SR (通讯作者)，Bath Spa Univ, Dept Sci, Bath, Avon, England.",s.lane@bathspa.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,21,22,0,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis based on secondary data sources and interviews with people involved when the dominant meat co-operative in Sweden underwent major changes. Findings - The decline in the Swedish meat industry is interpreted using the theory of institutional change presented by Aoki (2007, 2011). The country's former national agricultural policy created a specific set of norms and values. Co-operatives were considered to be indispensable. The co-operative sector was large and hierarchically organised. Therefore, external signals did not create sufficient endogenous processes within the co-operatives. Co-operative adaptation to rising competitive pressure took place only reluctantly and belatedly. Hence many farmer-members defected and the major co-operative faced finally insurmountable problems. A strong ideological conviction caused the once dominant co-operative to collapse and much of the Swedish meat industry to disappear. Originality/value - This study shows that strong ideology (here a conviction about the advantages of politically governed co-operatives) can hamper endogenous processes within an organisation. Management may ignore outside influences, to the extent that even a large industry is impaired. Other large, hierarchically structured and top-governed organisations with a strong ideology may behave in a similar way.","[Nilsson, Jerker] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lind, Lena W.] Minist Enterprise & Innovat, Rural Growth Div, Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Nilsson, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",Jerker.Nilsson@slu.se,,,,,,,33,9,9,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper focuses on the impact of social workers called Homen iin on reducing the infant mortality rate in inter-war Tokyo. These social workers were in charge of the medical casework and provided access to medical treatment for low-income households under the District Committees System. To examine how the activities of these social workers influenced infant mortality, this paper analyses panel data for Tokyo between 1926 and 1937. By employing the dynamic panel quantile regression approach, it is found that the activities of social workers played a vital role in mitigating the risk of infant mortality, especially in areas that had a higher infant mortality rate.","[Ogasawara, Kota] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Social Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Kobayashi, Genya] Chiba Univ, Fac Law Polit & Econ, Chiba, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology; Chiba University,"Ogasawara, K (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Social Engn, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",ogasawara.k.ab@m.titech.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [13J06738, 13J09772, 26885029] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,79,11,11,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2015,9.0,1,,,,,97.0,130.0,,10.1007/s11698-014-0110-1,0.0,,,34,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AX8GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347147700005,0

Design/methodology/approach - Children aged 11-12 years old were recruited to complete an adapted free association test (n = 89). Each participant was exposed to four pictures of dishes that included combinations of the experimental food items served with potatoes and sauce.

Evoked associations were coded and categorized before the relationship between the expected liking of the dishes and the associations were visualized based on correspondence analysis. Findings - The authors found that the expected liking of the dishes was significantly affected by the composition of the dish, that the associations related to the meal changed when the vegetable component changed, and that children's associations to food are quite similar to what previous studies have found for adults. Originality/value - How children categorize complex dishes and how their mental representation explains expected liking has rarely been investigated before.

The results show that economic growth and structural change towards material-intensive counties explain most of the growth in global material use. Slight gains in material efficiency and falling importance of material-intensive sectors have decelerating effects. The country-level analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity. Some nations exhibit stable or falling material use, while it increases notably in most countries.

Design/methodology/approach - A new emotional model in which cognitive factors influence emotional factors from the bottom-up was made and the validity of the model was tested. A social survey was conducted in Tokyo, Japan, among 120 female undergraduate students. Findings - The results showed that the new emotional model had a higher validity than the conventional emotional model, in which emotional factors influence cognitive factors. Research limitations/implications - The reliability and validity of the present models should be reconfirmed with a sample of more than 200 subjects in the future. The sample comprised only Japanese female undergraduate students and additional studies be conducted with diverse samples to ensure that the proposed model is valid and reliable across multiple settings. Future studies should verify whether the use of other topics would produce the same results. Practical implications - As it is often difficult to directly affect consumer's emotions by providing information and education for only a short period of time, it may be advisable to try to change consumer's cognitions about the perceived risks and benefits through information and education instead. Social implications - The greater significance of the current study is the suggestion that the influence of perceptions on emotions should also be considered when evaluating consumer's acceptance. Originality/value - This study showed that the influence of cognitive factors, such as perceived risk and perceived benefit, is also effective in an emotional model. This importantly suggests that consumer's emotions like anxiety and anger can be changed by altering consumer's cognitions or perceptions.","[Tanaka, Yutaka] Osaka Gakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan; [Kitayama, Masaya; Arai, Sho; Matsushima, Yuki] Ueno Fine Chem Ind Ltd, Osaka, Japan",,"Tanaka, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Gakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan.",yutanaka@ogu.ac.jp,,,,,,,42,5,5,2,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This needs consumers' knowledge of the logo. According to earlier research consumers' knowledge of the EU organic logo is low. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to elicit consumers' attitudes towards organic certification and labelling and to develop recommendations on how to improve consumers' knowledge of the EU organic logo. Design/methodology/approach - By means of an online survey with 3,000 participants in six European countries, knowledge of the logo and attitudes towards organic farming and European labelling, as well as organic food purchase behaviour and socio-demographic indicators were elicited. Factor and cluster analysis based on several statements on the test persons' attitudes towards organic farming and corresponding EU legislation were conducted in order to segment consumers. Findings - The results indicate that knowledge of the logo is low. Only about 15 per cent of all respondents knew its meaning. Four clusters of consumers could be identified: Committed organics, Pragmatic organics, Organic sceptics and Organic disinterested'. With reference to the EU organic legislation's aim of promoting the organic market, particularly Organic sceptics should be addressed by emphasising the trustworthiness of the organic certification and labelling system. Originality/value - Segmenting consumers according to their attitude towards organic farming, its labelling and certification allows for targeted and efficient communication and organic market development.","[Zander, Katrin] Thuenen Inst, Thuenen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany; [Padel, Susanne] Elm Farm, Organ Res Ctr, Newbury, Berks, England; [Zanoli, Raffaele] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Marche Polytechnic University,"Zander, K (通讯作者)，Thuenen Inst, Thuenen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany.",katrin.zander@ti.bund.de,"Padel, Susanne/M-7044-2017; Zander, Katrin/H-8803-2016; Zanoli, Raffaele/I-4476-2012","Padel, Susanne/0000-0001-7762-5592; Zanoli, Raffaele/0000-0002-7108-397X",,,,,51,30,32,5,61,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Fiscal priorities made it impossible to fully compensate the hikes by raising energy subsidies. This paper examines the potential impacts of a limited deregulation of the petroleum price on the income distribution in Malaysia, paying specific attention to differences in impacts on major ethnic groups. We introduce an extended social accounting matrix (SAM) model, which not only incorporates substitution possibilities among production inputs and consumption goods, but also allows for the exogenous determination of the price of intermediate inputs. The results of simulations indicate that distributional impacts of rising petroleum prices tend to be regressive, affecting poor people more severely than richer people. All ethnic groups experience income loss with the real incomes of Malay households (which are relatively poor, on average) more than the Chinese and Indian households (which are the generally richer).

Most (94%) of these plants were outdoor-grown, and 46% of those were discovered on federal lands, primarily on national forests in California, Oregon, and Washington. We developed models that reveal how drug markets, policies, and environmental conditions affect grow siting decisions. The models were built on a rational choice theoretical structure, and utilized data describing 2322 cannabis grow locations (2004-2012) and 9324 absence locations in the states' national forests. Predictor variables included cannabis market prices, law enforcement density, and socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental variables. We also used the models to construct regional maps of grow site likelihood. Significant predictors included marijuana street price and variables associated with grow site productivity (e.g., elevation and proximity to water), production costs, and risk of discovery. Overall, the pattern of grow site establishment on national forests is consistent with rational choice theory. In particular, growers consider cannabis prices and law enforcement when selecting sites. Ongoing adjustments in state cannabis laws could affect cultivation decisions on national forests. Any changes in cannabis policies can be reflected in our models to allow agencies to redirect interdiction resources and potentially increase discovery success.

The search process is usually not observed, which creates econometric challenges. I show that inventory and the availability of different package sizes create new sources of variation to identify search costs in storable goods markets. To evaluate the importance of costly search in these markets, I estimate a dynamic choice model with search frictions using data on purchases of laundry detergent. My estimates show that consumers incur significant search costs, and ignoring costly search overestimates the own-price elasticity for products more often present in consideration sets and underestimates the elasticity of frequently excluded products. Firms employ marketing devices, such as product displays and advertising, to influence consideration sets. These devices have direct and strategic effects, which I explore using the estimates of the model. I find that using marketing devices to reduce a product's search cost during a price promotion has modest effects on the overall category revenues, and decreases the revenues of some products.","[Pires, Tiago] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Pires, T (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",tpires@email.unc.edu,,,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/43857/2008]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/43857/2008] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"I am especially indebted and grateful to Aviv Nevo for his advice, guidance and support.

We find that the equilibrium distribution of polluting firms differs from the social optimum when they generate a large amount of stationary pollution and have much higher or lower productivity than clean firms. In these cases, conventional pollution control approaches generally do not bring about an optimal distribution.

Ecosystem services are now generally used in identifying an appropriately wide range of environmental variables for policy and management as well as better understanding the benefits provided by those aspects of the environment. A review of the dominant definitions of ecosystem services reveals the term is comprehensive in its scope and requires further specification for most purposes. Analysis further reveals that there are four main categories of conceptual definitions. The paper concludes that ecosystem services can be identified at various points along the spectrum of nature-human interaction depending on which specific definition is chosen and that the term was not created to identify a novel set of environmental objects or processes.

We investigate a case of mixed pricing across a large subset of products on a major e-commerce website.

Past decades have seen the development and applications of various methods for CO2 emissions allocation. This paper provides a literature review of CO2 emissions allocation with emphasis on the evolution of allocation methods used. It begins with a summary of the most popular allocation principles and criteria that lay a foundation for the development of allocation methods. We then classify the existing allocation methods into four groups, namely indicator, optimization, game theoretic and hybrid approaches. The main features and findings of past studies are identified and summarized. While the fairness principle prevails in earlier studies, the efficiency principle has been found to receive increasing attention recently. We also present a comparison of the empirical results based on ten popular indicator methods to show how indicator choice affects the allocation results. Issues related to selecting appropriate methods in CO2 emissions allocation are finally discussed. Further research may be carried out to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency so that the allocation results become more widely acceptable and economically feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental approaches to two-stage network data envelopment analysis are the multiplicative and the additive efficiency-decomposition approaches. Both they assume a series relationship between the two stages but they differ in the definition of the overall system efficiency as well as in the way they conceptualize the decomposition of the overall efficiency to the efficiencies of the individual stages. In this paper, we first show that the efficiency estimates obtained by the additive decomposition method are biased, by unduly favouring one stage against the other, while those obtained by the multiplicative method are not unique. Then, we present a novel approach to estimate unique and unbiased efficiency scores for the individual stages, which are then composed to obtain the efficiency of the overall system, by selecting the aggregation method a posteriori. Within the particularity of two-stage processes emerging from the conflicting role of the intermediate measures, we develop an envelopment model to locate the efficient frontier whose derivation from our primal multiplier efficiency assessment model is effectively justified. The results derived from our approach are compared with those obtained by the aforementioned basic methods on experimental data as well as on test data drawn from the literature. Similarities and dissimilarities in the results are rigorously justified.","[Despotis, Dimitris K.; Koronakos, Gregory; Sotiros, Dimitris] Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Despotis, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",despotis@unipi.gr,"Sotiros, Dimitrios Georgios/AEW-1906-2022; Despotis, Dimitris/AAR-2021-2021; Koronakos, Gregory/I-2130-2016","Sotiros, Dimitrios Georgios/0000-0002-9995-3906; Despotis, Dimitris/0000-0003-2515-093X; Koronakos, Gregory/0000-0002-6170-3725",European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES-Investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund,European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES-Investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund,"The authors wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, which helped us improve the quality of the paper.

The purpose of this paper is to quantify the perceived contribution of strategies to the performance of three honey value chains in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - The value chain structure-conduct-performance (SCP) framework was used to select strategies and two performance indicators, honey production growth and local value-added. In a conjoint study, experts were asked to judge the contribution to the two performance indicators of several hypothetical combinations of value chain strategies. Findings - According to the experts, adoption of specialised technical assistance, sharing resources at the production step, increase in exports, and organic certification were the strategies which contributed the most to performance. Simulations suggested that some honey value chains could have greatly increased their performance with these higher pay-off strategies. Research limitations/implications - Quantifying the perceived impact of individual strategies contributes to improved evaluation of development interventions. Practical implications - Outcomes also show that conjoint analysis is a useful method for policy evaluations in data scarce situations. Originality/value - The paper combines an extended SCP framework for strategy selection and conjoint analysis for strategy evaluation of value chains.","[de Figueiredo, Hugo Santana, Jr.; Meuwissen, Miranda P.

Moreover, we undertake a comparative analysis between the performances of fully hedged versus fully unhedged portfolios. More specifically, we derive efficient frontiers for both hedged and unhedged portfolios diversified among US and European emerging markets stocks. The purpose of this paper is to give an insight on currency exposure and hedging policies in recent times for a US investor, so the period taken into consideration is January 2013-December 2015. Moreover, by comparing the currency movement exposure and the performance of different hedging policies in the last three years versus the Global Financial Crisis and pre-crisis periods, characterized by different global macroeconomic developments and financial markets evolutions, we want to emphasize the trend in hedging policies during recession times and to compare the optimal hedging policy in normal versus financial turbulent periods. We consider as the pre-crisis period the period between August 2005 and July 2007 and as the crisis period the period between August 2007 and April 2009. The main findings of the paper indicate that hedged portfolios outperform the unhedged ones for high values of risk, when the pre-crisis period is taken into consideration. The period of high turbulences during the Global Financial Crisis reveals a different behaviour of portfolios diversified among US and European emerging markets stocks, the results indicating that the unhedged portfolios outperform the hedged ones, for moderate and high values of risk. In the recent period, during January 2013 and December 2015, we deal with a mix in optimal hedging policies. For very low values of risk, the unhedged portfolios outperform the hedged ones. For moderate values of risk, the US investor obtains a slightly higher return for hedged and unhedged portfolios. Therefore, the optimal hedging policy clearly changes over time. Hedging currency risk is a better option for the US investor when taking into consideration the pre-crisis period, while letting the diversified portfolio unhedged in times of crisis and in recent times, in the last three years, is more profitable in terms of returns.","[Horobet, Alexandra; Turbatu, Ioana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Int Business & Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Horobet, A; Turbatu, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Int Business & Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",alexandra.horobet@rei.ase.ro; ioana.a.turbatu@gmail.com,"Horobet, Alexandra/D-2301-2010","Horobet, Alexandra/0000-0001-5821-0244",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-267-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,7.0,16.0,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8MB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392431400001,0

A fair value of the firm is equally important in its survival, growth, M&A, privatization or liquidation and all the determining factors should be carefully considered (financial indicators such as turnover, dividends paid, profit, investments, assets, PER, or other components such as size, firm's age and history, market share, goodwill, costs, R&D, innovations, etc.). For the Romanian top 10 listed companies, I use the market capitalization (multiplication of the value of a stock by the number of outstanding stocks). I found that no. 1 in the top 10 transactions at Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) is a bank announcing organic growth of over 10% in its lending, over 19% in new deposits, and a successful merger. The total return to stocks is the sum of the capital gain and dividends paid. My econometric model estimates how the value of a company varies depending on the announced results (acquisitions, dividends paid, or costs); the starting point is a time series of prices of shares converted into series of (unit-free) returns. Log-returns can be interpreted as continuously compounded returns, and so the frequency of compounding of the return does not matter and thus returns across assets can be compared.","[Ion, Madalina Viorica] Acad Econ Studies, Finance Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ion, MV (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mvmadalina@yahoo.com,"Manu, Mădălina Viorica/N-9722-2019","Manu, Mădălina Viorica/0000-0002-1516-3668",,,,,8,0,0,0,7,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-267-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,45.0,47.0,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8MB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392431400004,0

The purpose of this paper is to estimate existence of buyer power in the Italian market of fresh milk. The sector is characterised by high industrial and retail firms concentration and a significant gap between the downstream and upstream prices exists. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied the first-pass test proposed by Lloyd et al. (2009) on a set of monthly price indexes series from 2000 to 2013 in order to estimate if a buyer power exists in this sector. This in order to verify how prices are transmitted along the supply chain and to determine if buyer power contributes in conditioning the retail-producer price spread. Findings - Estimated results suggest that buyer power exists in the Italian fresh milk supply chain and oligopsonistic behaviour affects the spread between downstream and upstream prices. Originality/value - The paper gives a contribute on estimation of buyer power in the agro-food supply chains. However, more research needs to be carried out in order to precisely evaluate the nature and the causes of presence of buyer power.","[Madau, Fabio A.; Furesi, Roberto; Pulina, Pietro] Univ Sassari, Dept Sci Nat & Environm Resources, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Madau, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Sci Nat & Environm Resources, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",famadau@uniss.it,"Pulina, Pietro/AAY-1005-2021","PULINA, Pietro/0000-0003-1147-6891; Madau, Fabio/0000-0003-3661-3194",,,,,30,9,10,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The rampant use of pesticides and chemical-based fertilizers in agriculture has, increased the productivity but at the same time they have created an alarming situation for the environment. The demand of the hour is to therefore to encourage organic farming and offer a better choice to consumers as well as save the environment. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the factors affecting perception of consumers on organic food products in Indian context. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a structured survey of 150 respondents covering Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) of Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad (India). Exploratory research was used to know the variables from the literature that affect the perception of consumers regarding organic food. Descriptive research was used to understand the demographic profile of the organic food consumer's. Conclusive research design was used to test the hypotheses based upon the motivating and inhibiting factor in the growth of organic food. Findings - The data collected from the survey were analyzed using t-test, chi(2) test, factor analysis and multiple linear regression tests. Results indicated that the intention to purchase organic products was impacted by the consumer's belief on the safety and health aspect of the product, trust and certification, information and availability and lifestyle and are hence drivers of growth. And certain impeding factors were identified like doubt in the professed quality of organic food, lack of awareness and price parity. Social implications - There are enough evidences of fertile land being converted into wasteland because of use of agro-chemical-based fertilizers in farming. There are also enough incidents of polluted water (ground and surface) due to agrochemical-based farming. Heavy use of pesticides leads to adverse effect on the health of farmers also. There were many reports of farmers committing suicide because of debt due to heavy investment on pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farming is a win-win proposition for environment, farmers and consumer's. Originality/value - The study was an effort to understand awareness and perception of organic food consumers in urban India post-agriculture revolution. The result would help the organic food producing and marketing companies to understand the factors that influence the belief of consumers when they purchase organic food and henceforth they can formulate communication strategies and marketing policy based on consumer's expectations.","[Misra, Richa; Singh, Deepak] Jaipuria Inst Management, Noida, India",,"Misra, R (通讯作者)，Jaipuria Inst Management, Noida, India.",richa.misra@jaipuria.ac.in,"SINGH, DEEPAK/AAB-5894-2021","SINGH, DEEPAK/0000-0003-1516-8589; Misra, Richa/0000-0003-2851-7215",,,,,53,45,46,3,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study design using both semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires was used. The study was conducted in the Eastern part of Kenya and included 600 smallholders. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings - The results show that price fairness, price reliability, and relative price are dimensions of price satisfaction that affect producers' trust in the buyer. Moreover, trust between the producer and the buyer is found to he a strong mediator between price satisfaction and producer loyalty. The findings support recent studies about trust and its mediating role. Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on a cross-sectional study design, limiting the causal inferences which can be drawn. Producers' preferences change with time and future studies should be based on longitudinal designs. Originality/value - This paper shows the relationship between the multi -dimensional nature of price satisfaction and producer loyalty with trust as a mediating variable in the business-to-business (B2B) context, Although B2B relationships have been shown to be of great importance for smallholders in enhancing business performance with their buyers, little attention has been given to the role of trust as a mediator. This study offers interesting insights into the how trust plays a mediating role between price satisfaction and loyalty in a developing country context.","[Mutonyi, Sarah; Beukel, Karin; Hjortso, Carsten Nico] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gyau, Amos] World Agroforestry Ctr, Dept Markets Policy & Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Copenhagen; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Mutonyi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",sarah@ifro.ku.dk,"Hjortsø, Carsten N/IZE-4157-2023; Hjortsø, Carsten N/I-5548-2013; Mutonyi, Sarah/N-6254-2016","Hjortsø, Carsten N/0000-0002-2365-8740; Hjortsø, Carsten N/0000-0002-2365-8740; Mutonyi, Sarah/0000-0002-0010-3726",,,,,76,12,13,0,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Adolescents' vistas on food competences in a convenience context,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competences; Food consumption; Adolescents; Convenience foods; Social practices,CONSUMERS; CHOICES,"Purpose - Adolescents are at a stage in their life course in which they increasingly become choosers, buyers and preparers of food. Hence, they develop and employ required competences. Current food-related competences of adolescents are shaped in an environment with an abundance of convenience foods. Simultaneously food education has been limited in many western countries. The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize how young practitioners engage with the notion of convenience in a context with a strong presence of convenience foods. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical data for this paper have been collected in a Dutch high school context following a participatory approach in focus group discussions. Data have been gathered from different food-related exercises within a classroom context. Findings - The findings indicate that adolescents' food competences and meanings are heavily shaped by the abundant presence of convenience foods. Adolescents perceive a nuanced picture of a skilful consumer that incorporates convenience foods in ways that minimize time efforts, preserves some preparatory tasks for fun cooking and has knowledge about health effects of fatty and salty foods. Originality/value - The investigation takes a novel look on convenience food consumption from a practice perspective scrutinizing competences through the lens of adolescent practitioners. The authors make a plea for tapping into the potential of research on children and adolescents as novice performers of practices to understand how practices are shaped and changed and how practices recruit new practitioners.","[Wahlen, Stefan; van der Horst, Hilje; Pothoff, Roosje] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Wahlen, S (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands.",stefan.wahlen@wur.nl,"Wahlen, Stefan/A-2241-2015","Wahlen, Stefan/0000-0003-4564-9412",,,,,39,3,4,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These pressures range from obligatory forces to voluntary measures. Environmental pressures traditionally influenced organizations to seek reactive and internal practices. The adopted environmental management (EM) practices have evolved to be more proactive and external as the focus has shifted to supply chains. This paper aims to further understand the driving mechanisms for EM practices under various external pressures. To meet this research goal, this study extends the theory of dynamic incentives of environmental policies and institutional theory to develop environmental pressures. Using an empirical study of 422 Chinese manufacturers covering all 31 provinces and provincial cities, an exploratory factor analysis reveals four EM practices factors and four pressures (drivers) factors. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis show that coercive pressures positively relate to more reactive, internal EM practices. Less coercive pressures positively relate to more proactive, external, and green supply chain management practices. The empirical findings provide further support that voluntary regulatory measures can help motivate companies in extending their EM efforts to supply chains. The work also provides insights into how organizations may respond to evolving regulatory regimes, dynamic incentives of environmental regulatory policy, and various institutional pressures.

We ask if resource scarcity in the past, due to its effects upon past behaviors, influences current other-regarding behaviors. Contrasting theories and empirical findings on scarcity motivate our framed field experiment. Participants are rural Colombian farmers who have experienced scarcity of water within irrigation. We randomly assign participants to groups and places on group canals. Places order extraction decisions. Our treatments are sequences of scarcities: 'from lower to higher resources' involves four rounds each of 20, 60, then 100 units of water; from higher to lower resources' reverses the ordering. We find that upstream farmers extract more, but a lower share, when facing higher resources. Further they take a larger share of higher resources when they faced lower resources in earlier rounds (relative to when facing higher resources initially). That is inconsistent with leading models of responses to scarcity which focus upon one's own gain. It is consistent with lowering one's weight on others to, for instance, rationalize having left them little. Our results suggest that facing higher scarcity can erode the bases for collective actions. For establishing new institutions, timing relative to scarcity could affect the probability of success.

We argue that, despite recent advances, PES research remains weakly theorized in social and political terms, resulting in a merely superficial understanding of the role of culture, agency, social diversity and power relations in the shaping of PES institutions and their outcomes. Building on critical insights from the social sciences, we qualify some of the common assumptions underlying current mainstream and alternative conceptualizations of PES and identify crucial topics for future research. More specifically, we explore three key challenges in current PES research, associated with prevailing tendencies (1) to assume that institutions can be designed to 'fit' specific human-nature problems; (2) to oversimplify culture and social diversity through the apolitical concept of 'social capital'; and (3) to conceptualize human agency, collective action, and institutional change either through overly-rational or overly-structuralist models. We argue that an expanded actor-oriented, socially-informed and power-sensitive conceptualization of PES can help generate novel insights in the power geographies underlying institutional logics, and the complex ways in which PES policies are shaped and experienced in the field.

This approach may be advantageous across a wide range of non-market valuation settings. We use angling survey data that includes bimonthly data on angler demand, water quality and fish weight in the Rotorua Lakes and compare our results with those obtained using attribute data averaged over the year. Estimates of marginal willingness to pay for catching fish based on annual data are 5 times higher than those based on bimonthly data. Likewise, the estimated welfare gain from a 1 m increase in water clarity is 1.5 times higher in models using annual data. We find that within-season variability in recreational site attributes can have a statistically significant effect on welfare estimates. The effect of seasonal variation in site attributes has rarely been accounted for in travel cost random utility models of recreation. We conclude that appropriate treatment of temporal variability can assist environmental managers to design more cost-effective policies based on improved estimates of welfare gains.

These methods describe certain aspects of the biophysical basis of society, which comprises in-use stocks and the processes and flows that maintain and operate these stocks. Despite this commonality, the methods are often developed and applied in isolation, which dampens scientific progress and complicates communication between scientists and decision makers. As research on socioecological systems matures, more structure and classification are needed. We argue that the concept of socioeconomic metabolism (SEM), which was developed in material flow analysis and material flow accounting, is a powerful boundary object that can serve as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human society. A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. We refine the notion of SEM, clarify the relation between SEM and the economy, and provide a list of features that we believe qualifies SEM as research paradigm. We argue that SEM as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts, suggest analogies that make the concept more accessible, and discuss its limitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The barriers that they identified are grouped into three categories. Context factors are embedded in the policy context and agendas that shape the environment in which an indicator percolates, indicator factors depend on specific characteristics of the indicators, while user factors relate to the level of experience and expertise of the users of indicators and the institutional culture in which they operate. Drawing on the different barriers that are reported, we identify four opportunities to increase the policy value of alternative measures of economic welfare: harmonizing and updating the methodological framework, extending macroeconomic models to include a wider range of welfare-related items, improving the communication around these indicators and promoting indicator and researcher entrepreneurship. These opportunities should be regarded as recommendations to the scientific community that works on these alternative measures. The process of overcoming the different barriers listed in this paper should not be insurmountable, as there is clear international public support for using health, social and environmental statistics as well as economic statistics to measure societal progress and human well-being.

Despite SGD's socioecological salience, few peer-reviewed, empirical studies document the distribution of positive and negative effects. The City of Denton, Texas has similar to 280 active gas wells and over a decade of SGD. Here we use an environmental justice framework to analyze the distribution of SGD's costs and benefits within Denton. Using data on mineral property values from 2002 to 2013 and gas well locations, we ask: who owns Denton's mineral rights (i.e. the greatest financial beneficiaries) and how does this ownership pattern relate to who lives near gas wells (i.e. those who shoulder the nuisances and health impacts)? Our results show that Denton's mineral wealth is widely distributed around the U.S., residents own 1% of the total value extracted, and the city government is a large financial beneficiary. In addition to distributional inequities, our analysis demonstrates that split estate doctrine, legal deference to mineral owners, and SGD's uniqueness in urban centers create disparities in municipal SGD decision-making processes. The environmental justice issues associated with fracking in Denton also provide one possible explanation for residents' November 2014 vote to ban hydraulic fracturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, little is known about how ordinary individual investors managed risk within this framework. Using a newly constructed dataset of share ownership for those joint-stock companies listed in the financial press of the day, we reconstruct individual portfolio holdings for investors in these companies. We examine individual portfolio holdings first for the decade after the Glorious Revolution and then for the years around the South Sea Bubble. Despite a fivefold increase in the number of unique individuals in the market between the 1690s and the 1720s, we find that in each period roughly 80 per cent of those active in the equity market held shares in only one company, even though many shareholders had the capacity or wealth to diversify share portfolios. These outcomes suggest diversification against idiosyncratic liquidity risk. Overall, however, there is limited evidence that individuals were using their financial portfolios to protect against diversifiable shocks. For many, we argue, company-specific voting and firm governance rules drove market activity.","[Carlos, Ann M.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Fletcher, Erin] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA USA; [Neal, Larry] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Lafayette College; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Carlos, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,49,20,22,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Very few proposals, however, have been as focused and developed as the just transition strategy proposed by global labour unions. Yet, labour unions are remarkably absent from discussions of the transition towards a green economy. This is surprising as labour unions are arguably the largest organizations in the world fighting for basic rights and more just social relations. This paper tries to advance the potential contribution of labour unions in this arena by asking: what is the full scope of just transition today and how have labour unions developed and refined it over the years to render the move towards a green economy both environmentally and socially sustainable? The concept of just transition is hotly debated within labour unions and has different interpretations, and hence different strategies. The last section assesses these interpretations by means of a normative framework, which seeks to fuse political economy and political ecology. Empirically, we add to the growing literature on labour environmentalism, as well as transitions more generally. Analytically, our goal is to place the various approaches to a just transition within a heuristic framework of environmental justice that is explicit about power relations when demanding justice, two themes central to this special issue.","[Stevis, Dimitris] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Felli, Romain] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",Colorado State University; University of Geneva,"Stevis, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dimitris.stevis@colostate.edu; romain.felli@unige.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [PBLAP1-134448]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PBLAP1-134448] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors would like to thank the referees as well as the guest editors of the special issue for their helpful comments.

Such flow-based energy resources that rely on solar energy are supposed to lead us toward a sustainable energy future. However, because of their high capital intensity, renewable technologies require large amounts of matter, including both common and rare metals. These metals require energy for their production, and more specifically for their extraction. The energy cost associated with metal extraction is linked to mineral ore grade, meaning that as depletion progresses, energy cost increases. In addition, renewable energy resources deliver less net energy to society compared to fossil fuels, because of their diffuse nature. It is therefore easy to see that a close relationship exists between energy and metal sectors. In this article, we describe more precisely this relationship by investigating how the energy requirement associated with metal extraction could impact the energy-return-on-investment (EROI) of different renewable and nuclear technologies. More precisely, we present a methodology that can be used to calculate the sensitivity of the EROI of a given technology to a specific or to multiple metal ore grade degradation. We found that if considered separately, the qualitative depletion of a given metal has no significant impact on the EROI of renewable and nuclear technologies, unless its concentration approaches very low grade. However, if all metals are considered together, the EROI of these same technologies could be importantly diminished, especially if they tend to very low concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although the stochastic frontier (SF) model with sample selection has been investigated in Greene (J Product Anal 34:15-24, 2010), we intend to extend the model in several directions in this paper. First, we extend the distribution of the inefficiency from the half normal to truncated normal distribution. Second, we discuss the likelihood estimation method for the SF model with sample selection and also its most common incarnation, endogenous switching. Third, we suggest a simple framework to derive the closed form of the likelihood function using the closed skew-normal distribution. Fourth, we propose the estimator for the technical efficiency index due to Battese and Coelli (Empir Econ 20(2):325-332, 1995) based on the sample selection information. Finally, we also demonstrate the approach using the Taiwan hotel industry data.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Lai, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,10,12,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The pollution haven effect may be offset, however, when endogenous technical change and factor reallocation can compensate increased compliance cost. This paper identifies the overall effects on industrial activities from provincially differentiated regulation of energy saving in China. Econometric specifications take into account the workings of different policy instruments, quantity and revenue-based measurement of output, policy-induced price effects, and alternative measurement of productivity and competitiveness. Results indicate that an introduction of energy-saving policies leads to loss of output and productivity in energy-intensive industries initially, which is passed on to other industries via markets of capital and energy-intensive goods. Under higher regulation, energy-intensive industries become more capital-intensive, regain productivity more quickly, and increase export rates; other industries become more labor-intensive, recover more slowly, and decrease export rates. Through capital investment and factor reallocation, China's policy has been effective in improving industrial energy efficiency without causing competitive loss or carbon leakage. An incentive-based instrument of differential electricity prices leads to similar effects on industries, implying the possibility for more efficient policy-making. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The obligation for application of customs regulations in line with the EU Legal Acquest has arisen. Bearing in mind that the trade of local goods between the EU member countries is exempt from customs formalities and control, forwarding companies lose a large portion of their business. Most of international forwarding companies had to commit themselves to carrying out other general and specific lines of work instead of import duties, in order to compensate for the loss of the market space. The EU membership has brought the duty of Intrastat reporting, i.e. statistical research of trade in goods between the EU members. In this way, there arises the opportunity for authorized customs representatives to perform a new type of business, if the business entities delegate their duty of Intrastat reporting to the customs broker. In this way the international forwarding companies can compensate for the market space they lost when Croatia entered the EU. The goal of this paper is to give basic insights into the international forwarding companies' features, specificities of their business activities and their emergence as authorized representatives in Intrastat reporting on dispatches and arrivals of goods for the EU customers. This paper will serve as a guide to better understanding the role of international forwarders in reporting on dispatches and arrivals of goods in the European Union through Intrastat, as well as give a clearer picture of the future international forwarders are facing.","[Bendekovic, Jadranka; Naletina, Dora] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bojic, Aida] Metro Sped Doo Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bendekovic, J (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",jadranka.bendekovic@efzg.hr; dora.naletina@efzg.hr; aidabojic@yahoo.com,"Naletina, Dora/AAX-3207-2020","Naletina, Dora/0000-0002-6275-7039",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,301.0,310.0,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500032,0

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of funding upon competition in the sector and the entrepreneurial characteristics of microbrewers. With an emphasis on rural-based businesses, the local economic impacts are also examined. Design/methodology/approach - The research is informed by analysis of trends in both the brewing and public house sectors in the UK. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with microbrewers, including five who had received funding to support their development. These were supplemented with three days of participant observation at collaborative brewing events with 26 microbrewery owners and three microbrewery managers. Findings - The findings indicate that the value attached to microbreweries extends beyond their economic contribution with wider outcomes including training and job creation, the preservation of listed buildings and the enhancement of rural tourism. Funding stimulated entrepreneurial responses but support for these wider outcomes ran the risk of distorting competition. Originality/value - As competition increases in the sector, microbrewery owners need to become more entrepreneurial to maintain their market position. Competition is heightened by a number of lifestyle enterprises that can survive with lower profit levels while routes to market are limited by a decline in the public house sector. In such a pressured market, there is a need for clearer assessments of the impacts on local economies and entrepreneurship when grant funding is provided.","[Ellis, Victoria; Bosworth, Gary] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln Business Sch, Lincoln, England",University of Lincoln,"Ellis, V (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Lincoln Business Sch, Lincoln, England.",vellis@lincoln.ac.uk,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022","Bosworth, Gary/0000-0001-5381-4399; Ellis, Victoria/0000-0002-1074-3567",,,,,56,27,28,4,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted by applying interviews with the individuals in charge of the supply from a group of ten plants in this region that compete both for land for planting and for sugarcane itself. Findings - The findings show that plurality was observed in different levels of analysis (clusters): first, the plurality of transactions of sugarcane with different agents; second, plurality in hybrid arrangements or contracts; and finally, plurality in the same transaction. The reasons for the maintenance at Level 1 are various but, balancing the risks of the structures was an important motivator for this decision, while at Levels 2 and 3, the plural forms proved transitory, given the time of the contract and payment methods. Originality/value - One of the contributions of this study is to determine that generalizations about the transience or stability of plural forms are not appropriate. Another contribution of the research is the observation that in Sao Paulo's western region the singular forms of governance in sugarcane supply are not the most common for entrepreneurs who wish to work in sugar and/or alcohol production. Plural forms, as previously postulated in the literature, are more common.","[Feltre, Cristiane] Pontifical Catholic Univ Campinas PUC CAMPINAS, Ctr Accounting Econ & Adm, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [de Oriani e Paulillo, Luiz Fernando] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCAR, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Feltre, C (通讯作者)，Pontifical Catholic Univ Campinas PUC CAMPINAS, Ctr Accounting Econ & Adm, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",crisfeltre@yahoo.com,"Feltre, Cristiane/E-9726-2013","Feltre, Cristiane/0000-0002-0180-2916",Federal University o Sao Carlos,Federal University o Sao Carlos,Acknowledgments to Federal University o Sao Carlos for financial support in language translation.,,49,6,7,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The strategies and their determinants from the pricing environment are derived from an inductive sequential case study of certified food products, such as organic and fair trade products. Data are collected through desk research and interviews. Findings - The results reveal six different strategies that build on three basic mechanisms: cost-based pricing in combination with price fairness, increasing willingness to pay through perceptions of quality and/or price, and price stability in which costs are compensated for by scale and/or learning effects. Research limitations/implications - The framework can help companies that offer sustainable products strengthen their market positions and it can help policy makers that partly rely on markets to achieve sustainability objectives.

Austria serves as a case study in which impacts, trade-offs, and synergies of ES and ED are assessed for different agricultural policy pathways and regional climate change scenarios. Agricultural intensification and incentivized use of provisioning ES (e.g. biomass production) lead to higher macro-economic output (e.g. GDP) but usually reduce ES related to regulation and maintenance (e.g. ecological integrity, climate regulation), as well as cultural services (landscape diversity). We revealed both synergies for certain ES (e.g. biomass production and soil organic carbon stocks) as well as large spatial deviations from the national mean across the heterogeneous agricultural landscapes in Austria. Climate change scenarios (i) lead to substantial variation in ES and ED indicators and (ii) usually amplify trade-offs by stimulating land use intensification. Our findings depict the complex relationship between different ES and ED indicators as well as the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and regional climate change. This assessment can help to improve targeting of agri-environmental schemes in order to provide a more balanced and efficient supply of ES and to foster rural development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Given the fact that ethnic restaurants involve a number of peculiar elements that are not present when visiting regular local restaurants, the purpose of this paper is to identify the key determinants of choosing a particular ethnic-themed restaurant, as well as factors that have an impact on an ethnic restaurant's perceived image. Design/methodology/approach - Research was done by conducting two separate studies. The first study identified factors that were generally the most significant to respondents when making a choice of an ethnic restaurant in which to dine. For the second study, a new sample of respondents - consisting of those who had just visited such an establishment - was used in order to determine which factors have the most significant impact on creating an image of ethnic restaurants. The research was therefore directed toward those restaurants where the customers can experience a unique atmosphere and ambiance that are synonymous within a given culture. Findings - The results obtained from the first study show that quality of food and price are the two most significant factors that determine which restaurant will be visited. On the other hand, the interior and exterior ranked as the two least important factors. In addition, the second study revealed that following the visit, the strongest impact on the restaurant's image was its interior. Following interior, service quality surfaced as the most important antecedent of perceived image, while the impacts of price and exterior were weaker, but still statistically significant. Research limitations/implications - The study itself was done in two stages. In the first stage the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) model was used for ranking factors significant for choosing an ethnic restaurant, while in the second stage, structural equation modeling (SEM) model was used to identify triggers of perceived image after a visit to an ethnic restaurant. Future research should utilize both models to determine antecedents of the variables used. Apart from this, it is recommended to employ new variables that further explore the uniqueness of the ethnic restaurants. Originality/value - One of the main contributions of this work is related to combining of the AHP and SEM models, with the objective of completing a comparative results analysis, identifying in the process the positive aspects of both models and building a foundation for their coordination in terms of future use. This is significant, given that only a few prior studies have used such synergy.","[Marinkovic, Veljko; Mimovic, Predrag] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Management & Business Adm, Kragujevac, Serbia; [Senic, Vladimir] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Hotel Management & Tourism, Management & Business Adm, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Kragujevac; University of Kragujevac,"Marinkovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Management & Business Adm, Kragujevac, Serbia.",vmarinkovic@kg.ac.rs,"Mimović, Predrag/D-3492-2017","Mimović, Predrag/0000-0003-0323-8033; Senic, Vladimir/0000-0003-3543-0249; Marinkovic, Veljko/0000-0003-4749-7053",Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development [41010],"Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This research has been supported by the Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development - Grant number 41010.,,60,17,20,1,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Structured and semi-structured interview data responses were themed using an open coding system. This data were critically evaluated against both competition data, participant experience and relevant academic literature. Findings - This paper shows how the team's desire to highlight its national identity through food in the competition resulted in problematic experiences that were compounded by a tyranny of distance. However, these challenges were overcome through the creative dynamic the team developed and the networking benefits which the competition provided. These experiences added value not only to the team competitors but also the culinary and pastry practitioners in New Zealand's hospitality community. Originality/value - The research offers unique insights into how a representative pastry team from the New World negotiated international competition set in and heavily influenced by the Old World of culinary tradition.

We employ the concept of Shapley value from the area of cooperative game theory to measure a node's leadership and to develop the leader's overthrow algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a quantitative approach to analyze prospective structural modifications in social networks to make the initially identified network leader less influential. The resulting mechanism is based on the symbiosis of game-theoretic and algorithmic concepts.

This study employs a time-varying stochastic frontier approach for firm level panel data of Indonesian manufacturing industry and performs a non-parametric test of the closeness of two distributions. The results demonstrate that foreign firms achieve higher productivity but less efficient than domestic firms. Increasing degrees of foreign ownership is negatively related to firms' productivity but positively related to firms' efficiency. There are positive horizontal spillover effects of foreign direct investment on the firms' productivity and efficiency. The backward spillovers have positive impact on firm's efficiency, and the forward spillovers have positive impact on firm's productivity. However, there are negative backward spillover effects on firms' productivity and negative forward spillover effects on firms' efficiency. Besides that, within the same market technology spillover from FDI are smaller with higher level of labour quality. In the upstream market, the degree of absorptive capacity of suppliers has a negative impact on firms' productivity but have a positive impact on reducing inefficiency. In the downstream markets, the greater ability of the buyers to identify, assimilate and exploit knowledge spillovers, the greater the impact on increasing productivity but the lesser the impact on reducing inefficiency. Finally, this study finds that all components of productivity; technological progress, technical efficiency change and scale efficiency change significantly contribute in explaining the TFP growth.","[Sari, Dyah Wulan] Airlangga Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Jl Airlangga 4, Surabaya 60286, Indonesia; [Khalifah, Noor Aini] Natl Univ Malaysia, UKM, Dept Econ & Management, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Suyanto, Suyanto] Univ Surabaya Raya Kalirungkut, Dept Econ & Business, Surabaya 60293, Indonesia",Airlangga University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universitas Surabaya (UBAYA),"Sari, DW (通讯作者)，Airlangga Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Jl Airlangga 4, Surabaya 60286, Indonesia.",dyah-wulansari@feb.unair.ac.id,"suyanto, suyanto/B-4381-2016","suyanto, suyanto/0000-0001-9084-8379","Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business Airlangga University","Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business Airlangga University","This work was partially supported by the Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business Airlangga University.

The Committee's sectoral reports list the 900 or so manufacturing firms that it surveyed and that together accounted for more than half of Irish manufacturing employment. From a range of archival sources, this article identifies the nationality of ownership of most of these firms, alongside their date of establishment and level of employment in 1960. Industrial grants data are used to strip out export-oriented businesses that began to arrive in the 1950s. This makes it possible to estimate the employment share and sectoral presence of tariff-jumping foreign firms. The latter is analysed through the lens of modern perspectives on foreign direct investment.

We identify two similar referenda in 2004 and 2012 and estimate a first difference spatial regression model that seeks to understand the determinants of changes in support over time. Controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and political ideology, we find that referenda support is growing in densely populated communities relative to sparse ones, and there is a multiplicative effect of rapidly growing dense areas. This implies urban areas are becoming critical supporters for the preservation of farm, forest and open space lands, despite being non-proximate to lands at risk of development.

In this study the link between household water consumption and wellbeing is assessed via a household survey conducted in southern England and actual water consumption data for the same households received from their water supply company. While the study revealed a few correlations, in general no link was found between actual water use and wellbeing. This suggests that high wellbeing is attainable regardless of low water use (assuming, basic needs are met). In fact, when assessed through individual rather than composite measures of wellbeing, a weak but statistically significant link was shown between higher water use and some indicators of low wellbeing. Our results also show that actual water use appears to be unlinked to environmental attitudes, attitudes to water use or willingness to adopt water saving measures. This suggests that seeking a sustained reduction in water consumption via attitudinal change, alone is unlikely to be effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We argue for the need to properly conceptualise colonial settlement as an endogenous development process shaped by the interaction between prospective settlers and indigenous peoples. We conduct three comparative case studies in West, East and Southern Africa, showing that the success or failure of colonial settlement critically depended on colonial government policies arranging European farmer's access to local land, but above all, local labour resources. These policies were shaped by the clashing interests of African farmers and European planters, in which colonial governments did not necessarily, and certainly not consistently, abide to settler demands, as is often assumed.","[Frankema, Ewout] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Green, Erik; Hillbom, Ellen] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Sch Econ & Management, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Green, Erik] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Wageningen University & Research; Lund University; Stellenbosch University,"Frankema, E (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",ewout.frankema@wur.nl; erik.green@ekh.lu.se; ellen.hillbom@ekh.lu.se,"Hillbom, Ellen/AAU-6436-2020; frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015","Hillbom, Ellen/0000-0002-0820-2729;","School of Economics and Management, Lund University; European Research Council under the European Community (ERC) [313114]; Dutch Science Foundation (NWO VIDI) [016.124.307]; Swedish Research Council [2014-1509]","School of Economics and Management, Lund University; European Research Council under the European Community (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Dutch Science Foundation (NWO VIDI); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council)","Received 21 May 2015.

In such a setting biodiversity conservation organisations have two main options: (1) The 'buy alternative' where they buy the area of interest and either carry out the necessary land-use measures themselves or hire firms to do so, or (2) the 'borrow alternative' where they 'borrow' the land for conservation from private landowners who agree to carry out biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures over a certain period while the conservation organisation compensates them for their opportunity costs. Comparing both alternatives raises the question of budget efficiency, i.e. which alternative will lead to a higher level of biodiversity conservation for a given financial resources? In this paper we present a conceptual ecological-economic model, and then apply the model to analyse how changes in ecological and economic parameters influence the relative efficiency performance of the two alternatives.

Regarding the first question, progress on the ground has been slow, but important principles have been agreed within the convention on biological diversity (CBD) and its Nagoya Protocol (NP). Although domestic legislation is adopted, key user countries remain reluctant. They argue that the ABS regime needs to be supplemented with sector approaches within forums such as the Food and Agriculture Organization. In principle, this may sound logical, but sector approaches may risk undermining the ABS regime of the CBD/NP. The principle of access is more user-oriented and benefit sharing is weaker in the relevant FAO negotiations. Against this background, the future practical significance of the ABS regime remains uncertain. Norway has played an important leadership role in ABS within the CBD/NP framework. This stems in part from 'fortunate circumstances', as Norway has relatively few stakes in this issue area, but also includes strong normative elements: Norway's inclination to support weaker part, the South. The Norwegian position has also been solidified by good coordination and strong institutional capacity among the actors involved. However, there are indications of a growing split in the Norwegian position along sector lines. We do not yet have sufficient empirical evidence that this is the case-but if it is, achieving an effective ABS regime may be even more difficult.","[Rosendal, Kristin; Andresen, Steinar] FNI, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Rosendal, K (通讯作者)，FNI, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",kristin.rosendal@fni.no,,"Rosendal, Kristin/0000-0001-7956-3495",Norwegian Research Council [220630],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors would like to thank Morten Walloe Tvedt and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on previous versions of this paper.

In this paper, we collected data from hedonic property value studies and merged these data with ancillary spatial data describing forest and socio-economic characteristics surrounding each study area to conduct a meta-analysis of the impact of tree canopy cover on the value of residential properties. The meta-analysis suggests that property-level tree cover of about 30% and county-level tree cover of about 38% maximize the implicit price of tree cover in property values. Currently, tree cover in the original study areas was about 14%, on average, around or near study properties. The empirical results, therefore suggest under investment of tree cover on private property from the perspective of individual property owners and from a societal perspective. The findings also have implications for community forest programs regarding planting trees and protection of mature trees to address potential changes in tree abundance, species diversity and stand age due to development and climate change.

Sustainability transitions will be easier to implement if they also increase individuals' well-being. We investigate the relation between the ecological footprint and the subjective well-being at the individual level, using a questionnaire carried out in Flanders (Belgium). Our results suggest that a lower footprint does not reduce well-being in the sense that we find no significant correlation. In a next step, we investigate the direct impacts of the different ecological footprint components on subjective well-being. Switching to a more environmentally friendly diet and not using electricity for domestic heating create win-win situations as these actions decrease the ecological footprint while increasing reported levels of well-being. Finally, we investigate the socio-demographic determinants of the ecological footprint and subjective well-being to look for indirect impacts. Having a relationship and being a house owner increase subjective well-being and decrease the ecological footprint. Better social life and health and living in a pleasant environment increase subjective well-being with no cost in terms of ecological footprint. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The demand regime is modified by taking into account Porter's hypothesis, which suggests that environmental innovations, spurred by environmental policies, can foster competitiveness. As a result, the equilibrium BOP constrained rate of growth increases, leading to a different version of Thirlwall's Law, which opens room for analyzing the impact of environmental innovations on convergence between developing and developed economies. The productivity regime in turn considers the growth and employment implications of innovations in labor productivity (standard innovations) and environmental efficiency (environmental innovations). It is argued that the fiscal policy and composition of public expenditure matter for long run growth, employment and sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey and the Canadian Institute for Health Information to estimate the relationship between per capita provincial health care expenditures and both self-assessed health status and the Health Utility Index. Our sample includes all individuals who were 18 years old or over at the beginning of the survey in 1994. We use random effects ordered probits for self-assessed health status and quantile regressions for the Health Utility Index (HUI). Our results show that provincial health care expenditures have a limited effect on self-rated health status and the HUI. It may be that self-rated health status and the HUI are noisy measures of heath status and as such, combined with the small variation observed in health care expenditure trends over the period, make the magnitude of the relationship between health care expenditures and health difficult to estimate.","[Pierard, Emmanuelle] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Pierard, Emmanuelle] Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pierard, Emmanuelle] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Waterloo,"Piérard, E (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.;Piérard, E (通讯作者)，Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Piérard, E (通讯作者)，Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy.",epierard@uwaterloo.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Statistics Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Statistics Canada,"This research was supported by funds to the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Statistics Canada.

In this article, occupational statistics from Protestant marriage registers of historical Kampala are used to investigate the hypothesis that African gender inequality and female disempowerment are rooted in colonial times. We find that the arrival of Europeans in Uganda ignited a century-long transformation of Kampala involving a gender Kuznets curve. Men rapidly acquired literacy and quickly found their way into white-collar (high-status) employment in the wage economy built by the Europeans. Women took somewhat longer to obtain literacy and considerably longer to enter into white-collar and waged work. This led to increased gender inequality during the first half of the colonial period. However, gender inequality gradually declined during the latter half of the colonial era, and after Uganda's independence in 1962 its level was not significantly different from that of pre-colonial times. The data presented here also support Boserup's view that gender inequality was rooted in indigenous social norms: daughters of African men who worked in the traditional, informal economy were less well-educated, less frequently employed in formal work, and more often subjected to marital gender inequality than daughters of men employed in the modernized, formal economy created by the Europeans.","[Selhausen, Felix Meier Zu] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Weisdorf, Jacob] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",Utrecht University; University of Southern Denmark,"Selhausen, FMZ (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,,University of Southern Denmark; Danish Research Council [DFF 4003-00088],University of Southern Denmark; Danish Research Council(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"We would like to thank Jorg Baten, Angus Crichton, Davide Cantoni, Dieter von Fintel, Gareth Austin, Johan Fourie, Ewout Frankema, Leigh Gardner, Jan Kok, Alexander Moradi, Kim Ooesterlinck, Kevin O'Rourke, Eric Schneider, Gaaitzen de Vries, Jan Luiten van Zanden, and three anonymous referees, as well as the seminar participants at the universities of Groningen, Nijmegen, Stellenbosch, Pisa, Utrecht, and Wageningen, and conference participants at the 8th African Economic History Workshop (Lund), 10th Swedish Economic History Meeting (Lund), 4th European Congress of World and Global History (Paris), the Crossroads in African Studies Conference (Birmingham), the 2nd CEPR Economic History Symposium (Vienna), the NWO ClioInfra Workshop (Barcelona), and the Impact of Family and Demography on Labour Relations Worldwide, 1500-2000 Workshop (Amsterdam) for helpful in-depth comments and suggestions.

This division was based on the share of global companies (trans-national corporations) in the value of sales revenues in individual branches of the food industry. Then, the author compared the groups with the use of traditional factors (labour productivity, land productivity) and multi-dimensional productivity factors from the Data Envelopment Analysis. The research indicates that the sectors with very high and high degrees of globalization report definitely higher labour productivity and wages and salaries, with a slightly higher DEA-measured productivity but lower fixed asset productivity.","[Baran, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Baran, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.",joanna_baran@sggw.pl,"Domagała, Joanna/AAR-8194-2020","Domagała, Joanna/0000-0001-9801-4344",,,,,19,3,3,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,200.0,206.0,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700028,0

The aim of the study was to gather initial information about creative learning and creative teaching environment in Latvia. The study outlines problems in the area of creative teaching environment in education system of Latvia, simultaneously viewing education policy documents and inspecting the actual situation in education institutions of Latvia. The study uses qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews and content analysis. In Latvia, creativity is defined as individual self-expression, ability to create new opportunities. Creativity is mostly developed by linking theory with practical activities, with everyday processes. Creativity is believed to be a mandatory skill necessary for every cycle of human life. Creativity is related to all individuals as attainable and developed skill. The main stimuli and initiators of creativity are different social agents in the environment of formal and informal education, local government, projects etc. that promote cooperation as essential prerequisite of creativity. These few 'key' people are essential, since they initiate and develop different activities, and different understanding of parties involved, acknowledgment and implementation of their opportunities and competencies are very important for reaching of common goals. The main obstructing factors are related to the lack of common understanding, goals and cooperation between parties involved.","[Bite, Dina; Kronberga, Ginta; Kruzmetra, Zenija; Janmere, Lana] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Bite, D (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Jelgava, Latvia.",Dina.Bite@llu.lv,"Bite, Dina/AAG-3835-2019","Bite, Dina/0000-0003-1589-3676",,,,,3,1,1,0,4,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,16.0,24.0,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200001,0

The results may be helpful in understanding to what extend North America consumers appreciate Parmesan cheese and brands, Parmesan consumption and price while recognizing market segments according to consumer awareness, involvement and covariate effects. Design/methodology/approach - A class of mixture models, known as combination uniform binomial (CUB), is applied to survey data collected in USA and Canada. A questionnaire, filled out by 540 restaurant customers, collects opinions about consumption, purchase features and price. The CUB model estimates the two latent variables, known as feeling and uncertainty, explaining the respondent's behavior as awareness and involvement variability while the CUB clustering procedure detects market segments. Findings - CUB results show that the Parmesan is a well-known cheese but also that a small share of consumers look for the place of origin. The model detects market segments where consumers express better awareness on taste, price and origin while the knowledge of imported Parmesan brands is lacking. Most of consumers, not paying attention to the origin, would hardly switch to the imported Parmesan because of higher price or because they are already satisfied of the domestic cheese. Research limitations/implications - The results suffer some restrictions in the sample representativeness. A further analysis, where the survey is done at retail and advances in CUB models, may improve the market segmentation procedure allowing a better generalization of results. Practical implications - The survey results highlights the appreciation and consumption of Parmesan cheese, especially for its taste, as well as a low perception of Italian brands. Consequently, trade companies should focussed their communication strategy on activities encouraging North American consumers to taste Italian Parmesan brands (e.g. tasting sessions, price promotions) instead of costly and less effective advertising campaigns. Social implications - Parmesan brand misunderstandings are often associated with market information asymmetry. The paper results show a market segmentation where purchases are mainly driven by Parmesan taste regardless of domestic or imported brands. Likely, the consumption of domestic Parmesan is well consolidated and it is not a consequence of brand information asymmetry. Originality/value - The CUB model is an innovative and flexible no parametric approach for evaluating consumer behavior and for segmenting the market while dealing with complex problems of food knowledge.","[Boatto, Vasco; Rossetto, Luca; Arboretti, Rosa] Univ Padua, TeSAF Dept, Legnaro, Italy; [Bordignon, Paolo; Salmaso, Luigi] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Boatto, V (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, TeSAF Dept, Legnaro, Italy.",vasco.boatto@unipd.it,"Arboretti, Rosa/AAY-6499-2020","ARBORETTI GIANCRISTOFARO, ROSA/0000-0003-1263-0440",European Rural Development Plan of Veneto Region (Italy),European Rural Development Plan of Veneto Region (Italy),"This study comes from the research project Innovative Patterns for Grana Cheese (Italian acronym, TIFG) which received a grant from the European Rural Development Plan of Veneto Region (Italy).

Design/methodology/approach - Given that different indicator variables were used to measure apple quality, the authors employed a principle component analysis method to reduce the measurement dimension. An ordinary least square regression was employed to analyse the effects of member size and selective incentives of agricultural cooperatives on product quality. Findings - The empirical results show that member size and cooperative's product quality bear an inverse U-shape relationship, and food safety certification and target market variables tend to positively and significantly influence cooperative's product quality. In particular, the cooperatives with more food safety certificates and targeting supermarkets and export enterprises are more likely to supply high-quality products.

Findings - The application of time and form postponement was verified in the companies studied, and the implementation of the postponement strategy led to changes in the productive process of tomato-derived products. These changes involved the movement of the decoupling point and the increase in the make-to-order production, which had positive impacts on the businesses. Research limitations/implications - This paper analyzed the application of postponement in a specific sector of the food industry. Future research must analyze the application of this strategy in other segments of the food industry and other sectors as well.

However, it has been observed that consumption of these foods is declining. The purpose of this paper is to establish the determinants of consumption intentions of MP's in Kenya using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Design/methodology/approach - A stratified random sample of 319 respondents drawn from Nairobi County was surveyed using a self-completion instrument, Partial least squares analysis was used to test the hypotheses regarding the relationship between the predictor constructs (namely; personal attitude towards AIFs, subjective norm, and perceived behaviour control) and consumption intentions. Findings - All the predictor constructs were found to positively influence consumption intention and collectively explained 62,3 per cent of the variance in consumption intention for AIFs. There is a discrepancy between our findings on intention to consume AIFs and the reported declining consumption. Marketers and policy makers should address factors in the intention-consumption behaviour relation in addition to focusing on the antecedents of intention.

Identification of these characteristics will provide a decision-making tool for continuing the effective development of the value chain process. Design/methodology/approach - Key characteristics necessary to develop strong relationships were identified from the literature. These characteristics will assist the relationship to evolve into a long-standing mature relationship. An expert panel evaluated four value chain analysis (VCA) case studies against these characteristics in order to identify patterns in relationships that could explain the varied performance of these cases. Findings - In total, 15 relational characteristics were identified that must be present in the engagement stage before initiating the next step in the VCA process. An assessment of the activities associated with pre-relationships and early relationships within the value chain provide a strong indication of the chains ability to conduct successful VCA. Research limitations/implications - This research furthers the understanding of value chains and adds an important and novel contribution of relationship characteristics to the early stages of relationship development within value chains. Originality/value - The application of relationship development to the engagement of value chains is an extension to the VCA literature. Relationships are a proven foundation component of successful value chains, and yet relationship development research from business-to-business marketing has not been well incorporated into the value chain literature. The framework proposed in this paper facilitates an assessment on the level of chain engagement and readiness to take the next step in the value chain process, thus making a valuable practical contribution.","[Hastings, Kathleen; Lawley, Meredith] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Howieson, Janet] Curtin Univ, Ctr Excellence Sci Seafood & Hlth, Bentley, WA, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; Curtin University,"Lawley, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",mlawley1@usc.edu.au,"Caiazza, Rosa/C-6138-2015","Caiazza, Rosa/0000-0001-6067-9973",Australian Government's CRC Programme; Fisheries RD Corporation,"Australian Government's CRC Programme(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Fisheries RD Corporation","This work formed part of a project of the Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre, and received funds from the Australian Government's CRC Programme, the Fisheries R&D Corporation, and other CRC participants.",,92,17,18,2,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The data set was collected through a survey at the 2014 Salon du Chocolat in Brussels, Belgium. The authors distributed 700 copies and received 456 complete responses (65 percent response rate). Choice experiments were used to estimate the relative importance of different chocolate characteristics and to predict respondents' willingness to pay for marginal changes in those characteristics. The authors estimate both a conditional logit model and a latent class model to take possible preference heterogeneity into account. Findings - On average, respondents were willing to pay 11 euros more for 250 g fairtrade labeled chocolate compared to conventional chocolate. However, taste clearly dominates ethical considerations. The authors could distinguish three consumer segments, each with a different tradeoff between taste and fairtrade. One group clearly valued fairtrade positively, a second group valued fairtrade to a lesser extent and a third group did not seem to value fairtrade. Originality/value - Chocolate can be seen as a self-indulgent treat where taste is likely to dominate other characteristics. Therefore it is unsure to what extent ethical factors are included in consumer decisions. Interestingly the results indicate that a significant share of chocolate buyers still positively value fairtrade characteristics when selecting chocolate varieties.","[Poelmans, Eline; Rousseau, Sandra] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Rousseau, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Brussels, Belgium.",sandra.rousseau@kuleuven.be,"Rousseau, Sandra/C-8723-2011","Rousseau, Sandra/0000-0001-8948-8644; Poelmans, Eline/0000-0002-2008-8682",,,,,75,34,37,3,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The correlation and determination coefficients, calculated in a regression analysis of the productivity and cost of labour in Latvia, indicate a medium strong linear relationship between the variables.","[Saulaja, Inese; Zvaigzne, Anda] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia; [Mietule, Iveta] Rezekne Acad Technol, Rezekne, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Rezekne Academy of Technologies,"Saulaja, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",saulaja.inese@gmail.com,"Mietule, Iveta/AAM-4272-2020; Zvaigzne, Anda/AAZ-7057-2020; Mietule, Iveta I/A-5299-2016","Zvaigzne, Anda/0000-0001-5762-8622;",,,,,11,4,4,0,5,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,150.0,156.0,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700021,0

The spatial MDCP model is capable of predicting both the type and intensity of urban development patterns over large geographic areas, while also explicitly acknowledging geographic proximity-based spatial dependencies in these patterns. At a methodological level, the paper focuses on specifying and estimating a spatial MDCP model that allows the dependent variable to exist in multiple discrete states with an intensity associated with each discrete state. The formulation also accommodates spatial dependencies, as well as spatial heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity, in the dependent variable, and should be applicable in a wide variety of fields where social and spatial dependencies between decision agents (or observation units) lead to spillover effects in multiple discrete-continuous choices (or states). A simulation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach to recover parameters from a cross-sectional spatial MDCP model. The results show that the MACML approach does well in recovering parameters.

We simultaneously estimate a cost function for biodiversity conservation and the production set of biodiversity output and timber, while controlling for conservation measures. We show strong substitutability between biodiversity conservation and timber production. Estimate results on the cost-elasticity of biodiversity conservation also suggest the possibility of more ecologically ambitious contracts with lower average costs. Results also show that public owners are able to bear higher opportunity costs than private owners.

Much analysis in the development-climate literature has framed development as a co-benefit, while the objective has been climate stabilization. This misses the point that development drives emissions, not vice versa. A different approach must address low-emission technologies, but also the high-emission parts of 'development'. Politically, climate change must be understood as a development problem. In this conception, a key task for climate policy is to explore different development paths, with the difference in emissions being a result. Development goals need to be represented as explicit objectives, both in analytical modelling and as political goals. Methods that treat climate policy as a self-control mechanism in the development system, or back-cast from development goals, need to be improved. The article further considers levers to change development paths, considering lessons on how to influence change in complex systems. The obsession of the existing economic order is with economic growth and development; what needs to be considered is the quality of development and what it means to live well. A social contract for low-carbon development requires the rich to pay for mitigation, use less, and assist the poor; lift the poor out of poverty; and change the aspirations of the middle class. Such a contract requires thinking beyond short-term political and economic time frames, with much longer-term thinking and vision.","[Winkler, Harald; Boyd, Anya; Gunfaus, Marta Torres] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Raubenheimer, Stefan] SouthSouthNorth, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Winkler, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, Private Bag UCT, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",harald.winkler@uct.ac.za,"Winkler, Harald/AAF-6226-2020","Winkler, Harald/0000-0002-5826-4071",,,,,65,19,21,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While past studies have focused on visual attention to nutrition information, no study has investigated the visual attention paid by consumers to the sustainability information on food. Our study contributes to the need to better understand consumers' attention to sustainability information when making food choices. The objective was to explore the importance that consumers attach to sustainability attributes and investigate how this relates to the visual attention paid to these attributes during the choice decision and to willingness-to-pay (WTP). Visual attention during the decision making process was measured in terms of fixation time and fixation count, which were then analyzed in relation to the stated attribute importance. Our results suggest that consumer segments with differences in stated attribute importance, visually attend differently to these attributes.

The policy, under which the charge revenues are refunded back to the regulated firms in proportion to energy output, was explicitly designed to affect investment in NOx-reducing technologies. The main finding is that REP had a significant effect on the adoption of post-combustion technologies. Moreover, we also find some indications that the effects of REP have been enhanced by the existing system of individual emission standards. In particular, the effect of REP speeding up the pace of adoption of post-combustion technologies is considerably larger in those counties where stringent standards are in place.

A microeconomic analysis of Swedish consumption behavior,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Engel curve; Greenhouse gas emissions; Rebound effect; Re-spending; Sustainable consumption; Vegetarianism,FOOD-CONSUMPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; REQUIREMENTS; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; OPTIONS; CHOICES,"Sustainable diets, in particular vegetarianism, are often promoted as effective measures to reduce our environmental footprint. Yet, few conclusions take full-scale behavioral changes into consideration. This can be achieved by calculating the indirect environmental rebound effect related to the re-spending of expenditure saved during the initial behavioral shift. This study aims to quantify the potential energy use and greenhouse gas emission savings, and most likely rebound effects, related to an average Swedish consumer's shift to vegetarianism. Using household budget survey data, it estimates Engel curves of 117 consumption goods, derives marginal expenditure shares, and links these values to environmental intensity indicators. Results indicate that switching to vegetarianism could save consumers 16% of the energy use and 20% of the greenhouse gas emissions related to their dietary consumption. However, if they re-spend the saved income according to their current preferences, they would forego 96% of potential energy savings and 49% of greenhouse gas emission savings. These rebound effects are even higher for lower-income consumers who tend to re-spend on more environmentally intensive goods. Yet, the adverse effect could be tempered by purchasing organic goods or re-spending the money on services. In order to reduce the environmental impact of consumption, it could thus be recommended to not only focus on dietary shifts, but rather on the full range of consumer expenditure.

The paper extends the existing focus of stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) on production and cost functions by considering additional inter-relationships which may exist between a public service provider's funding level, input prices, clientele characteristics and the level and quality of the output they achieve in different relevant directions. The potentially large multiplier effects which these additional relationships generate from efficiency and effectiveness improvements are incorporated into the analysis and the estimation process by extending the standard notion of a production possibility frontier to the more general concept of an achievement possibility frontier. The paper also generalises SFA's use of a univariate half-normal density function by deploying a multivariate skew-normal density function in the stochastic structure of these multiple inter-relationships, thereby permitting correlations to exist between the efficiency and effectiveness deviations for individual producers across these different inter-relationships, while including a half-normal marginal distribution for production efficiency deviations as a special limiting case. This approach also generates point estimates for the cumulative effectiveness coefficient of each individual public service producer that generalise the earlier results based on a half-normal distribution. In doing so, the paper extends the analysis of SFA of feasible increases in an individual producer's output to important contexts in which the endogeneity of key variables needs to be taken into account.","Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Mayston, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",david.mayston@york.ac.uk,,"Mayston, David/0000-0001-5115-3240",,,,,30,8,8,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Currently, several U.S. federal agencies and international institutions are incorporating the ecosystem services approach into their decision-making processes. Since 1999, the concept has been included in guidance documents for environmental impact assessments under the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). More recently, the U.S. Forest Service approved a Planning Rule to include ecosystem services in Forest Plans. However, some people already describe the U.S. Forest Service NEPA process as cumbersome, which might be compounded by adding new layers of analysis. To assess the potential of incorporating ecosystem services into land management decisions, we surveyed over 500 U.S. Forest Service professionals about incorporating ecosystem services in environmental impact analysis processes. Our goal was to determine (a) whether and how the ecosystem services concept is currently used in Forest Service NEPA analyses, (b) staff perceptions about how influential NEPA guidance documents are, and (c) whether respondents think that the ecosystem services concept is useful in NEPA processes (and more broadly in environmental decision-making). Forty-one percent of respondents were unfamiliar with ecosystem services, but a majority of the respondents thought that ecosystem services could be helpful in the NEPA process. Opinions were divided about whether or not ecosystem services would improve communication with stakeholders. One finding with potentially broad implications for executive branch policy-making is that survey results indicate that U.S. Forest Service staff found Environmental Protection Agency and Council on Environmental Quality guidance documents less influential than internal Forest Service directives. At the same time, the guidance documents that include ecosystem services language were the least influential among the guidance documents listed in the survey. Applying the results as a case study to advance ecosystem services scholarship, we suggest clarification of the ecosystem services framework, metrics, and guidance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We provide an example of how EPA is applying structured decision-making (SDM) as a framework for guiding development of scientific information, data, and models to support watershed and marine-based management in coastal communities. In particular, we have been using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model as a tool in the SDM process to identify and assemble a broadly applicable suite of information with relevancy for coastal management, including 1) development of conceptual models to clarify the decision context 2) identification of measurements of ecosystem attributes, ecosystem goods and services, and their connection to stakeholder objectives, 3) elaboration of potential decision alternatives, and 4) identification of ecosystem production and valuation functions for modeling consequences of decision alternatives on benefits derived from coral reefs. Finally, we overview how this information is being applied for two case studies: development of water quality criteria and watershed management to protect coastal resources. We posit that applying a systems thinking framework, such as DPSIR, within a structured decision-making approach will better enable marine ecosystem managers to utilize scientific information toward more sustainable decision-making.

If grazing pressure is very strong, the grass biomass becomes depleted and more herders choose to move their animals to an alternative rangeland. These herders may return to the focal rangeland when the quantity and quality of the grass improve. Our model assumes that herders tend to choose the foraging site that gives the higher payoff in a manner described by stochastic best response dynamics. In the model, this social dynamics is coupled with the dynamics of the grass biomass. The resulting system generates typical non-linear behaviors. For example, it may exhibit bistability, with two distinct locally stable equilibria suggesting a strong dependence on the initial condition, or perpetual large-amplitude fluctuation: Implications for rangeland management are discussed.

Although addressing a series of issues, Dobado mainly questions our use of the welfare ratio methodology to assess standards of living in colonial Spanish America. In this article we explain how, despite its limitations, this methodology provides a solid, transparent metric to compare economic development across space and time. In particular, welfare ratios present more economically relevant information on living standards than the commodity wages that Dobado prefers (Dobado Gonzalez and Garcia Montero 2014). We argue that Dobado fails to offer convincing evidence against our findings; hence, we stand by these results, which suggest that the divergence between North and Latin America began early in the colonial period.","[Allen, Robert C.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Murphy, Tommy E.] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy; [Schneider, Eric B.] Univ Sussex, Dept Hist, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England",New York University; Bocconi University; University of Sussex,"Allen, RC (通讯作者)，Fac Social Sci, A5 169,POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",bob.allen@nyu.edu; tommy.murphy@unibocconi.it; e.b.schneider@sussex.ac.uk,,"Schneider, Eric/0000-0001-7682-0126",,,,,43,11,15,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Area estimates from land cover maps may be biased by misclassification error resulting in flawed assessments and inaccurate valuations. Adjustment for misclassification error is possible for maps subjected to a rigorous validation programme including an accuracy assessment. Unfortunately, validation is rare and/or poorly undertaken as often not regarded as a high priority. The benefit of map validation and hence its value is indicated with two maps. The International Geosphere Biosphere Programme's DISCover map was used to estimate wetland value globally. The latter changed from US$ 1.92 trillion yr(-1) to US$ 2.79 trillion yr(-1) when adjusted for misclassification bias. For the conterminous USA, ecosystem services value based on six land cover classes from the National Land Cover Database (2006) changed from US$ 1118 billion yr(-1) to US$ 600 billion yr(-1) after adjustment for misclassification bias. The effect of error-adjustment on the valuations indicates the value of map validation to rigorous evidence-based science and policy work in relation to aspects of natural capital. The benefit arising from validation was orders of magnitude larger than mapping costs and it is argued that validation should be a high priority in mapping programmes and inform valuations.

I find that there were inter-religious differentials in reaping the benefits (or losses) of industrialization.

The main objective is to evaluate the impact of land tenure systems and agricultural practices on these values. Data on 338 parcels, located in the Pampas region, are analyzed. The tenure appears to be a particularly important variable. We find that plots rented either by physical persons or by companies are negatively valued in relation to plots owned. Results also highlight the importance, though not to a large degree, of a diversified cropping pattern compared to soybean monoculture. Soil quality, location of the plots, distance to markets, as well as to the nearest city, were also found to affect land values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we develop and apply ecological economic and econometric frameworks to evaluate these potential risk-reducing effects of species diversity in terms of yields and their temporal stability from a farmer's perspective. Our empirical analysis is based on a rich panel dataset obtained from a diversity experiment covering in total 60 species and a period of 6 years. We find empirical evidence for the risk-reducing effect of species diversity and the economic assessment reveals significant insurance values associated with diversity for a risk-averse decision maker. Thus, the economic value of diversity would be underestimated if not accounting for this property, and species diversity may serve as valuable ex-ante risk management strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Like a modern marketing board, the state purchased agricultural commodities (cotton and wheat) at low prices and sold them on world markets at much higher prices, a policy equivalent to an export tax. Ali also replaced tax farming with his own land taxes. The revenues so derived were used in part to finance manufacturing investment and to build irrigation canals. In addition, Ali supplied flax and cotton at those cheap purchase prices to domestic textile manufacturing, thus subsidizing the industry. He also used non-tariff barriers to exclude foreign competition from domestic markets. Were Ali's state-led policies successful in fostering industry? The answer is no easier to extract from this phase of Egyptian history than from that of other poor countries at that time. This is because Egypt faced the same terms of trade boom typical of most poor commodity exporters, which was causing de-industrialization everywhere else in the poor periphery. Ali picked a very difficult time to pursue his agenda, but we show that his policies were successful.","[Panza, Laura] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Melbourne; Harvard University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Panza, L (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,50,6,8,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on personal structured questionnaire survey of 83 contractors in one of the major mango growing areas in India. A snowball sampling approach was adopted to select suitable respondents for the study. Descriptive statistics have been computed to understand the contractor's response on contract attributes. Factor analysis was used to categorize the contractors' responses on various attributes of the mango contract. Further, a logistic regression model has been developed to determine the factors affecting the contract decisions. Findings - The study identifies nine aspects of mango contracting covering orchard owner, orchard and contract management characteristics. Further, a logistic regression model has been developed to assess the factors affecting the contractor's decision on the time of entering into mango contracting, i.e. pre-flowering or post-flowering stage. Regression analysis results clearly indicate that contractors who prefer pre-flowering contracts pay significantly higher attention to contract management attributes. On the other hand, those contractors who normally enter in contract once the mango trees have flowered are more likely to pay attention to orchard-related features. Practical implications - Specifically, the results have implications for contract terms, contract efficiency and effectiveness and overall performance. Finally, the study provides suggestions for a future research agenda to analyze mango production contracts. Originality/value - Though contracting in mango growing is a common phenomena, there is limited analysis on identifying the key contract attributes and factors affecting the contract structure.","[Ali, Jabir; Kumar, Sushil] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Ali, J (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jabirali@iiml.ac.in,"Ali, Jabir/I-1955-2019","Ali, Jabir/0000-0002-5891-568X","National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP); Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi","National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP); Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi(Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR))","This paper is a part of externally funded research under National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi.

Through a perceived quality model, this paper identifies the implicit, intrinsic, extrinsic and credence quality cues consumers' use in their decision to purchase fresh meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilised the shopping mall intercept survey method. Data were collected from traditional markets and modern retail outlets in the Klang Valley region in Malaysia. A structured questionnaire was designed to measure consumer's perceptions and experiences of food quality when purchasing fresh meat and fresh fruit and vegetables from retail outlets. In this study, univariate data analysis (descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance) and exploratory factor analysis were performed to analyse the data sets. Findings - Freshness (intrinsic cue), was the most frequently cited variable when respondents thought about the quality of both product categories. Other variables included price and cleanliness (extrinsic cues) and Halal (credence cue), which was associated with the quality of fresh meat. Quality was associated with freshness, food safety, nutrition and value. Exploratory factor analysis identified food safety (implicit cue) as the most important construct in the respondents' evaluation of quality for both fresh meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. Originality/value - There is a paucity of research focusing on consumer's perceptions and experiences of food quality in the purchase of fresh meat and fresh produce in Malaysia. The findings of this research may assist the Malaysian food industry by providing new insights into the consumers' perceptions of food quality.","[Chamhuri, Norshamliza] Natl Univ Malaysia, Sch Econ, Bangi, Malaysia; [Batt, Peter J.] Curtin Univ, Sch Management, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Curtin University,"Chamhuri, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Malaysia, Sch Econ, Bangi, Malaysia.",norshamliza@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,45,49,3,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modelling (SEM) with partial least square (PLS) was used to examine the determinants of MeSTI adoption in food industry. Findings - Responses to a questionnaire were collected from 89 firms, and statistical results confirmed that organizational factors (top management support and perceived technical competent) and scheme factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) have significant influence upon MeSTI adoption. While environment factors (perceived industry pressure and perceived government pressure) and expected factors (expected social legitimacy and expected economic competitiveness) did not have significant impact on MeSTI adoption. Regulatory incentives the government offered had no moderating effect on the relationships of the determinants studied. Practical implications - Although many companies remain unfamiliar or have limited knowledge of MeSTI, the respondents surveyed herein, which were small and medium enterprises (SMEs), argued that MeSTI was very helpful in controlling food safety standards inMalaysia. Government or non- government regulatory agencies should promote and encourage food industry compliance with the Malaysian food safety certification. Governments also need to rethink and redesign current regulatory incentives offers to the food industry, which often have no direct impact on the companies' business. Originality/value - Though many factors potentially could influence the industry to adopt a food safety scheme, the moderating effect of regulatory incentives is an interesting area to study in relationship to its potential effects to adopt food safety standards and practices. In some extent, this serves as a yardstick for measuring the impact of voluntary compliance and points to future directions for what should occur in the future.","[Fernando, Yudi; Ng, Hooi Huang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, George Town, Malaysia; [Walters, Tim] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Multimedia Technol & Commun, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Fernando, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, George Town, Malaysia.",yudi@usm.my,"Fernando, Yudi/E-8253-2012","Fernando, Yudi/0000-0003-0907-886X",,,,,43,9,10,4,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Three governance structures used simultaneously by the same company to purchase sugar cane from small-scale growers are described in detail. One of these structures is close to a market arrangement, the other two are hybrids. The discriminating alignment hypothesis and more recent work on hybrid models are used to explain the factors driving the choice for a hybrid arrangement and determining their specific form. Factors not covered by theory are identified. Findings - At least two areas would need to be included to explain the specific form taken by the studied governance structures: production characteristics and financial constraints of the transacting parties. Furthermore, the importance of national and local regulations in affecting organizational form by determining what is and is not possible is demonstrated. Research limitations/implications - This case study highlights limitations of current theory in fully explaining the personality of governance structures. Future work should not shun the finer details of governance structures and their interaction with the institutional environment. Social implications - Inclusive business models are promoted as tools for poverty alleviation and economic development. Public involvement plays an important role, however, more research is required to understand its reach and leverage its full potential. Originality/value - This paper is the first to rigorously apply transaction cost theory to inclusive business models in agricultural sourcing, an area which is rapidly gaining prominence on the development agenda.

We differentiate learning efficiency from the technical efficiency. The endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model is then used to decompose the factor productivity growth into components associated with technological change, technical efficiency, scale, and learning. This productivity growth decomposition provides useful information and policy level insight in firm-level productivity analysis. Empirical results based on plant-level panel data on the Colombian food manufacturing industry for the period 1982-1998 suggest that productivity growth not only stems from technical progress, technical efficiency change, and scale but also from significant learning effect.

EVIDENCE ACROSS INDUSTRIES FROM THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT,JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LOCATION; EMPLOYMENT; AGGLOMERATION; DETERMINANTS; PROGRAMS; ASTERISK; JOBS,"In this paper, we examine how government policy affects the sorting of industries across jurisdictions using the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program. When estimating the impact of the tax credit on business activity, there are likely to be unobservable local characteristics that are correlated with business location decisions that would cause OLS estimates to be biased. To control for this endogenous selection, we use a plausibly exogenous eligibility cutoff and compare census tracts that are just eligible for the NMTC program to those that are just ineligible. Using data from the Dun and Bradstreet MarketPlace Files, we find that eligibility for the NMTC program caused industries to sort across eligible and noneligible tracts. In particular, we find that there is an increase in retail employment, both among new businesses and existing businesses, and an increase in manufacturing employment at existing businesses in tracts that were eligible for the program. However, we find negative effects on employment at new firms in the wholesale and transportation industries, and decreases in the number of new firms in FIRE and services. Policy makers should be cognizant of these results, as the implications of the sorting across industries on local areas must be considered to design effective policy.","[Harger, Kaitlyn] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Ft Myers, FL 33908 USA; [Ross, Amanda] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University; West Virginia University,"Harger, K (通讯作者)，Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Ft Myers, FL 33908 USA.",Kaitlyn.Harger@gmail.com; Amanda.ross@mail.wvu.edu,"Ross, Amanda/AAI-9138-2020",,,,,,39,23,29,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308-923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87-2.60/tCO(2) of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385-1153/ha or US$ 1.09-3.25/tCO(2). We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD-I-policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We identify a large number of status quo (SQ) choosers in the internet survey that partly explain this result. Furthermore, respondents who speed through the survey questionnaire, and believe the survey to be inconsequential are more likely to be SQchoosers.

The diving industry relies on healthy reefs and can be positively and/or negatively impacted by ecological change. Quantifying divers' ecological preferences that influence economic outcomes can help inform managers and justify conservation. Utilizing non-market valuation, we assess SCUBA divers' preferences for ecological attributes of coral reef ecosystems in Guam, estimate WTP for coastal and watershed management, and investigate drivers influencing preferences. A discrete choice experiment grounded in ecosystem modeling reveals divers prefer reefs with greater ecological health (higher fish biomass, diversity, and charismatic species). Individuals with stronger environmental values expressed stronger ecological preferences. Fish biomass improvement from low (<25 g/m(2)) to high (>60 g/m(2)) was worth >$2 million/year. The presence of sharks and turtles together was the preeminent attribute, worth $15-20 million/year. Divers are willing to voluntarily contribute ($900thousand) towards watershed sediment-reduction projects that could benefit divers by improving reef conditions. Few policies are in place worldwide collecting fees from divers for coral reef management, and none in Guam. Our results suggest that understanding divers' preferences and the drivers behind them may assist managers in designing policies that capture divers WTP and create partners in conservation.

Consequences of coral reef habitat loss are expected to include reduced reef fisheries production. To our knowledge, the welfare impact of reduced reef fish supply in commercial markets has not yet been studied. We develop a global model of annual demand for reef fish in regions with substantial coral reef area and use it to project potential consumer surplus losses given coral cover projections from a coupled climate, ocean, and coral biology simulation (CO2-COST). Under an illustrative high emission scenario (IPCC RCP 8.5), 92% of coral cover is lost by 2100. Policies reaching lower radiative forcing targets (e.g., IPCC RCP 6.0) may partially avoid habitat loss, thereby preserving an estimated $14 to $20 billion in consumer surplus through 2100 (2014$ USD, 3% discount). Avoided damages vary annually, are sensitive to biological assumptions, and appear highest when coral ecosystems have moderate adaptive capacity. These welfare loss estimates are the first to monetize ocean acidification impacts to commercial finfisheries and complement the existing estimates of economic impacts to shellfish and to coral reefs generally.

In French Mediterranean mountainous areas, feeding patterns for sheep herds have been changing over the past decades in a manner which may not be favorable for agroecology. We hypothesize that labor plays a key role in this evolution. To test this hypothesis, we carried out observations and interviews, using the agrarian systems framework, with retired and active farmers in two areas of France. We built 7 sheep farm models and defined indicators assessing the contribution of different feed resources and the physical labor productivity in feed units in 1970 and 2013. The comparison of farm models highlights that herd growth has led to a focus on less labor-demanding feed resources, namely: (i) purchased feed in the Cevennes; (ii) meadows for single transhumance farms in the Alpine foothills; (iii) lowland winter grazing for double transhumance farms in the Alpine foothills. These changes are problematic from an agroecological perspective. This focus on labor offers a new perspective on changes in trajectories of livestock farming in the French Mediterranean region and serves as a basis for discussion on the importance of labor in agroecological transition.

This paper investigates its social acceptance by means of a robust methodology, employing 1) choice experiments, 2) structural equation modeling and 3) information treatments within an online nation-wide survey. Results show a great deal of preference heterogeneity: the majority of the sampled respondents oppose new nuclear plants in Italy, with some not willing to accept any monetary compensation at all. However, another segment of respondents, more confident that fourth generation nuclear energy goals will be achieved, show a modest support towards the implementation of new nuclear projects.

They warn that this violation of basic balance laws can lead to biased estimates of environmental impacts, and they therefore recommend performing 10 analysis in a physically accounted framework. We take a broader scope on this issue, and present price inhomogeneity as a special case of product mix inhomogeneity. We demonstrate that even a fully physically accounted 10 analysis or lifecycle assessment will violate balance laws if it suffers from inhomogeneous aggregation. The core issue is not whether a system is described using monetary or physical units, but rather whether product groups are too aggregated to allow for the concurrent respect of energy, mass, financial and elemental balances. We further analyze the link between the violation of physical balances and the introduction of biases. We find that imbalances are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the presence of systematic errors in environmental pressure estimates. We suggest two ways to leverage the additional explanatory power of multi-unit inventory tables to reduce instances of imbalances and aggregation biases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The roots of this process can be traced back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the Catalan economy became integrated into international trade, and a successful printed calico industry concentrated in the city of Barcelona. Although the factory system was largely adopted by the cotton industry in the 1840s, the diffusion of the spinning jenny in Catalonia had occurred earlier, in the 1790s. In line with Allen, this article explores whether relative factor prices played a role in the widespread adoption of the spinning jenny in Catalonia. First, series of real wages in Barcelona are supplied for the period 1500-1808. Second, the prices of labour and capital are compared and the potential profitability of the adoption of the spinning jenny is analysed. Findings show that although Catalonia was not a high wage economy in the way that Britain was in the second half of the eighteenth century, evidence from the cotton spinning sector confirms the relevance of relative factor prices in the adoption of new technology. Within the booming cotton sector after the 1780s, high wages created strong incentives for the adoption of the labour-saving spinning jenny.","[Martinez-Galarraga, Julio] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Prat, Marc] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Barcelona,"Martínez-Galarraga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"Martinez-Galarraga, Julio/AGM-6337-2022; Prat, Marc/H-5965-2015","Martinez-Galarraga, Julio/0000-0002-3876-3121; Prat, Marc/0000-0003-4071-6110","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-39169-C03-02, HAR2012-33298]; Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Capmany",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Centre d'Estudis Antoni de Capmany,"We would like to thank our colleagues at the Economic History Department of the University of Barcelona for their advice and suggestions.

In recent years, other disciplines have applied this concept in the context of the environmental assessment of products and policies, and multiple perspectives have unfolded more or less in parallel. Among these, the environmental rebound effect (ERE) perspective, focused on efficiency changes and indicators that go beyond energy to multiple environmental issues, has remained relatively unnoticed. This article thus asks the following questions: What are the foundational aspects of the ERE and how these relate to other perspectives? Are there irreconcilable differences between perspectives? And what is the value of the ERE towards a general framework? We map the fundamental ideas behind the ERE and find that the lack of articulation has resulted in inconsistent usage and lack of clarity. We also argue that the ERE offers many valuable insights for rebound assessment, such as the study of broader efficiency changes and of innovations aimed at tackling multiple environmental issues.

Instead, we estimate a flexible technology model that allows for type-specific technologies and show how it can be estimated using linear parametric forms including the translog. A common technology remains a special case of our model and is testable econometrically. Our sample, of publicly owned US electric utilities, does not support a common technology for integrated and specialized firms. Our empirical results therefore suggest that assuming a common technology might bias estimates of economies of scale and scope. Thus, how we model the production technology clearly influences the policy conclusions we draw from its characteristics.","[Triebs, Thomas P.] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Saal, David S.] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Arocena, Pablo] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Loughborough University; Universidad Publica de Navarra; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Triebs, TP (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",triebs@ifo.de,"Arocena, Pablo/K-6375-2017","Arocena, Pablo/0000-0002-4035-4597; Saal, David/0000-0002-9542-9496",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2010-21242-C03-03],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),We would like to thank the participants of the 39th EARIE conference in Rome for their helpful comments.

The most effective prevention against neonatal infections is exclusive breastfeeding. However, reasons such as maternal death during birth, maternal illnesses such as HIV and TB-meningitis, and lack of rooming-in facilities prevent the infant to be breastfed by his/her mother. One way to mitigate these infections is by supplying pasteurized donor-expressed breastmilk. In this paper, we consider the network expansion of the donated breastmilk distribution supply chain in South Africa. As with the distribution of most public sector and humanitarian relief goods and services, the transportation of donated breastmilk is hampered by the inherent uncertainty in the environment, and by the fact that in addition to efficient usage of resources, distribution should be made in an equitable manner. We incorporate uncertainty into our models by means of multiple scenarios, which are determined based on different assumptions about population size, HIV prevalence, and status of public health in the country, income, and education. We consider various equity-based objectives and propose rounding-based heuristics to solve these. We focus on two delivery schemes; one which uses out-and back transportation, and one that makes multiple stops on the delivery route. Using computational experiments, we analyze the trade-offs between the objectives as well as the effects of various public health policies, network expansion budget, and assumptions on supply and demand. We also describe the teaching materials resulting from this paper, which include a case study, a supply/demand estimation tool, and an interactive decision support tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using household survey data on fishing activities, we find that rules of both institutions have a statistically significant but small impact on the use of unsustainable fishing gear. We further find that Voodoo fishers who break the traditional Voodoo-based rule follow the fishing committee rule to the same extent as other fishers. This finding is consistent with a possible transition from the traditional Voodoo-based institution to the secular fishing committee institution. More research is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of, and interactions between, the two institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The plagues of 1563, 1603, 1625, and 1665 appear of roughly equal magnitude, with deaths running at five to six times their usual rate, but the impact on wealthier central parishes falls markedly through time. Tracking the weekly spread of plague, we find no evidence that plague emerged first in the docks, and in many cases elevated mortality emerges first in the poor northern suburbs. Looking at the seasonal pattern of mortality, we find that the characteristic autumn spike associated with plague continued into the early 1700s. Natural increase improved as smaller crises disappeared after 1590, but fewer than half of those born survived childhood.","[Cummins, Neil] LSE Econ Hist, London, England; [Kelly, Morgan; Grada, Cormac O.] Univ Coll Dublin Econ, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Cummins, N (通讯作者)，LSE Econ Hist, London, England.",,,,,,,,60,46,46,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

While neoclassical economic theory suggests that farms should maximize their efficiency regardless of their regulatory system, we find that farms operating in a more regulated environment have, on average, a lower cost efficiency. Differences in cost efficiency are primarily explained by allocative decisions-farms in the more regulated environment are overcapitalized and overly reliant on homegrown feed. Efficiency is estimated using bootstrapped data envelopment analysis and a stochastic distance function.

There is concern that food value chains arc promoted without adequately evaluating the viability of these businesses, or how these markets affect the performance and welfare of key stakeholders: farm vendors and local communities/economies. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews and summarizes a comprehensive set of US-basedcase studies focussed on food value chains. The authors conduct a meta-analysis to systematically capture what available case studies find about: first, trends in the viability of food value chain businesses; second, the impact of these businesses on participating farm vendors; and third, the associated community economic development outcomes (framed in terms of wealth creation). Findings In addition to sharing findings from the meta -analysis, the authors demonstrate how the lack of standardized protocols for case study development is a harrier to learning about metric comparisons, best practices, and what impacts these food value chain businesses may have. The authors conclude with some recommendations of how the field can move forward to evaluate and share lessons learned using more uniform, project-driven case study development.

With the rapidly growing popularity of wine consumption among Chinese consumers, an increasing number of Chinese consumers are visiting wineries in Western countries. However, while substantial research about wine tourism in Western countries has been published, there is very little research available with respect to wine tourism in China and the Chinese winery visitors who visit them. Design/methodology/approach - A convenience sampling method was selected. Specifically, snowball sampling was used to collect the study's data due to the limited number of Chinese consumers who drink wine and who have been involved with wine tourism. Research assistants who speak Chinese fluently used snowball sampling to recruit Chinese consumers in Yentai region who had participated in wine tourism in the past and asked them to complete the research survey. The research assistants distributed 200 surveys through a snowball sampling and collected a total of 179 responses. Findings - The study's results suggest that wine tasting operations, such as a variety of wines at tasting room tastings, and the quality of the wines tasted, along with staff attitudes are critical components that influence Chinese wine tourists' satisfaction and loyalty. Research limitations/implications - The major contribution of this paper is that it builds on extant wine tourism literature by providing insights into the characteristics of Chinese wine tourists. The paper also illuminates the linkage between winery service quality attributes and Chinese wine tourists' satisfaction and loyalty. Practical implications - The results of the study provide a useful guide to both academics and winery operators interested in developing a competitive winery service quality strategy for Chinese wine tourists. Originality/value - Given the scarcity of literature linking winery service quality attributes and Chinese wine tourists' satisfaction and loyalty, this study is one of the few studies to explore this relationship.","[Lee, Kyuho] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [Madanoglu, Melih] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Mkt, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Ko, Jae-Youn] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel Management, Seoul, South Korea",California State University System; Sonoma State University; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Sonoma State Univ, Dept Business Adm, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.",kyuho.lee@sonoma.edu,"Madanoglu, Melih/ABI-3630-2020; Madanoğlu, Melih/HKE-9966-2023","Madanoglu, Melih/0000-0002-3507-7169;",,,,,72,17,18,7,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Sport is the nature of the physical activities that can promote the competitions and the inner freedom. The competition is the human nature, and sport is the creation of the human competitions, and the competition and the inner freedom are the sports to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the people. The educational value of sports is to promote the essence. In the practice of the school physical education, we should have a correct understanding that the value of sports is to promote rather than produce people's essence, which has the subtle effect on the humans. The multiple causes of the physique and health prompt that the relationship between sports and fitness and between sports and health is the promotion or enhancement. We should start from the interests of the students, and avoid causing the academic pressure of the physical education. For a long time, there is an open debate in the school sports, the physique theory and the competition theory. The physique theory, according to the theory of the value threshold of the exercise load, expels the competitive sports from the school sports contrary to the two principles of the appropriate amount of exercises and the intermittent. The sports that are not the physical education are common in the sport classes in the basic education of moving the pumpkin and lifting the pumpkin, while the excessive athletic sports are performed as the Championships, with the excessive focus on the development of the sports of high levels, but ignores the interests and participation of most of the students in the sports. The physique theory identifies that the essence of sports is to enhance the physical fitness and the competitions and athletics do not belong to the school sports, while the competition theory overkills and expands the athletics of sports, which go toward two extremes, and the results are that they cannot very well play the functions of sports. This debate reflects the disadvantages in the understanding of the nature of the physical education, which are not conducive to the practice of the school physical education. This paper attempts to explore the nature of the physical education, and explores what the school sports should do from the relations between sports and the body and spirit of the humans and between sports and education.","[Li, Zhongmin] Henan Univ Chinese Med, Dept Phys Educ, Zhengzhou 450046, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Li, ZM (通讯作者)，Henan Univ Chinese Med, Dept Phys Educ, Zhengzhou 450046, Henan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,434.0,438.0,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200079,0

The Silicon Valley success stories of Airbnb and Uber have catalysed a vibrant sharing economy discourse, participated in by the media, incumbent industries, entrepreneurs and grassroots activists. Within this discourse the sharing economy is framed in contradictory ways; ranging from a potential pathway to sustainability, to a nightmarish form of neoliberalism. However, these framings share a common vision of the sharing economy (a niche of innovation) decentralising and disrupting established socio-technical and economic structures (regimes). Here I present an analysis of the online sharing economy discourse; identifying that the sharing economy is framed as: (1) an economic opportunity; (2) a more sustainable form of consumption; (3) a pathway to a decentralised, equitable and sustainable economy; (4) creating unregulated marketplaces; (5) reinforcing the neoliberal paradigm; and, (6) an incoherent field of innovation. Although a critique of hyper-consumption was central to emergence of the sharing economy niche (2), it has been successfully reframed by regime actors as purely an economic opportunity (1). If the sharing economy follows this pathway of corporate co-option it appears unlikely to drive a transition to sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The source materials consisted of the subject literature and the numerical information from EUROSTAT database. The research covered the period from 2005 to 2013. The analysis included all Member States of the European Union (in total 28 countries). Correlation between participation of renewable energy in total energy production process and the various parameters was established as well. The Pearson linear correlation coefficients applied for this purpose. The paper presents the analysis of participation of renewable energy in the total energy consumption. It was found that participation of renewable energy in the total energy balance continues to increase, differs in each country and is not dependent on the macroeconomic situation.

If we want to organize the more effective attack and defense in the fast and furious competitions, the rebound is particularly critical. Practice has proved that in a competition of high levels, the shots of a team are generally about 80 times, and the hit rate is most about 50%. That is to say, there are about 40 times of the rebound scramble under the baskets of the two sides. The rebounding requires that the athletes should possess many qualities, including the physical quality, the willpower, the rebound perception, and the technical and tactical application abilities and so on. The author of this article will talk about his own opinions aiming at these with the basketball players of all kinds at home and abroad as the objects combined with the usual teaching practice. The modern basketball is continuously developing, and the speed of the games is continuously improving, and the number of the shots and the fight for rebounds are also increasing. The rebound plays an extremely important role to strive for the initiatives of the matches and achieve the success. The rebound is the important means to obtain the possession of the ball, and an important way to increase the number of the attacks and launch the quick attacks, which is also the key to the conversion between the offense and the defense. There is the popular saying in the NBA that Whether we will win depends on the defense and how many scores we win will depend on the offense. The rebounding is the premise for the second-time offense, which also is the ultimate goal of the defense. Therefore, the rebounding technology is a basic skill that both the offensive and the defensive players should master.","[Wu, Guoqing] Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Wu, GQ (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,472.0,476.0,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200087,0

Three parallel studies were undertaken that 1) identified and quantified, where possible, how indicators for ecosystem service provision may change according to two future scenarios, 2) assessed members of the public's willingness-to-pay for improvements to a small number of ecosystem services as a consequence of a hypothetical management plan, and 3) facilitated a process of deliberation that allowed members of the public to explore the uses of the Dogger Bank and the conflicts and dilemmas involved in its management. Each of these studies was designed to answer different and specific research questions and therefore contributes different insights about the ecosystem services delivered by the Dogger Bank. This paper explores what can be gained by bringing these findings together post hoc and the extent to which the different methods are complementary. Findings suggest that mixed-method research brings more understanding than can be gained from the individual approaches alone. Nevertheless, the choice of methods used and how these methods are implemented strongly affects the results obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, even if the wages and income levels of rural populations are lower than those of urban residents, some people will remain in the rural areas or, in some cases, return from the cities. These observations imply the necessity of measuring the rural-urban disparity in Japan as well as the need for an alternative indicator to the conventional economic tools for taking this disparity measurement. The objective of this paper is to measure rural-urban disparity with GPI based on a case study in Japan. The results of this analysis present two key findings. First, the rural-urban disparity measured by the GPI is much smaller than that measured by GDP. Second, the GPI disparity has been an increasing trend, particularly after the 2000s, due to the increased cost of climate change in rural areas. GPI can identify some strengths of rural areas that are not captured by GDP, but these advantages are cancelled out by the increasing cost of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Often, an output distance function is used, where the classical approach is to exploit its homogeneity property by selecting one output quantity as the dependent variable, dividing all other output quantities by the selected output quantity, and using these ratios as regressors (OD). Another approach is the stochastic ray production frontier (SR), which transforms the output quantities into their Euclidean distance as the dependent variable and their polar coordinates as directional components as regressors. A number of studies have compared these specifications using real world data and have found significant differences in the inefficiency estimates. However, in order to get to the bottom of these differences, we apply a Monte-Carlo simulation. We test the robustness of both specifications for the case of a Translog output distance function with respect to different common statistical problems as well as problems arising as a consequence of zero values in the output quantities. Although our results show clear reactions to some statistical misspecifications, on average none of the approaches is clearly superior. However, considerable differences are found between the estimates at single replications. Taking average efficiencies from both approaches gives clearly better efficiency estimates than taking just the OD or the SR. In the case of zero values in the output quantities, the SR clearly outperforms the OD with observations with zero output quantities omitted and the OD with zero values replaced by a small positive number.","[Henningsen, Geraldine] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Henningsen, Arne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Jensen, Uwe] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen; University of Kiel,"Henningsen, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",gehe@dtu.dk; arne@ifro.ku.dk; jensen@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Henningsen, Arne/I-8113-2013","Henningsen, Arne/0000-0002-6720-0264; Henningsen, Geraldine/0000-0002-4651-1039",,,,,25,12,13,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The REA provided loans to cooperatives to lay distribution lines to farms and aid in wiring homes. Consequently, the number of rural farm homes electrified doubled in the United States within five years. We develop a panel data set for the 1930s and use changes within counties over time to identify the effect of the REA loans on a wide range of socio-economic measures. The REA loans contributed significantly to increases in crop output and crop productivity and helped stave off declines in overall farm output, productivity, and land values, but they had much smaller effects on nonagricultural parts of the economy. The ex-ante subsidy from the low-interest loans was large, but after the program was completed, nearly all of the loans were fully repaid, and the ultimate cost to the taxpayer was relatively low.","[Kitchens, Carl] Florida State Univ, Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kitchens, Carl] NBER, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Fishback, Price] Univ Arizona, Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Fishback, Price] NBER, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Arizona; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kitchens, C (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Econ, 269 Bellamy Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ckitchens@fsu.edu; fishback@email.arizona.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1357744] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,50,32,45,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

A missing link in this body of research is an emphasis on the range of factors influencing low-income households' exposure to neighborhood poverty over time. This paper examines the dynamics of exposure to neighborhood poverty for Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program participants. Our paper is unique in its emphasis on the role of vehicle access as it shapes exposure to neighborhood poverty. We find that vehicle access is an important factor shaping residential spells and transitions to low-poverty neighborhoods over time. We also find that the combined influence of a geographically-targeted residential mobility requirement and vehicle access substantially elevates a household's likelihood of accessing and staying in a low-poverty neighborhood. These findings suggest that residential mobility programs and similar efforts to spatially deconcentrate poverty should pay particular attention to the transportation needs of low-income households.,"[Dawkins, Casey; Jeon, Jae Sik] Univ Maryland, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pendall, Rolf] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Urban Institute,"Dawkins, C (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Natl Ctr Smart Growth Res & Educ, 1112 Preinkert Field House Bldg 054, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dawkins1@umd.edu; jsjeon11@umd.edu; rpendall@urban.org,"Jeon, Jae Sik/AAY-3727-2020","Jeon, Jae Sik/0000-0001-7557-0436",U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),"The authors would like to thank the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for providing the funding supporting this work.

It first shows that Campbell's data on mid-eighteenth-century journeymen wages, apprenticeship premiums, and masters' set-up costs in London are consistent with other sources. It then applies instrumental variable regressions to estimate the elasticity of apprenticeship premiums with respect to journeymen wages and set-up costs, using Campbell's education and ability requirements by trade to instrument for wages. We find an elasticity of one with respect to wages, and of 0.25 with respect to set-up costs, both statistically significant at a p-value less than 0.1%. We interpret these findings as supporting the thesis that apprenticeship played an important role in adapting the English workforce to the skill requirements of the industrial revolution in its early stages, insofar as the institution of apprenticeship in London was representative of other parts of England. Furthermore, by demonstrating the internal and external consistency of Campbell's observations, our findings should encourage their use as an unparalleled source of detailed, trade-specific wage data from the early years of the industrial revolution.","[Justman, Moshe; Van der Beek, Karine] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Justman, Moshe] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Ben Gurion University; University of Melbourne,"Justman, M (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"VAN DER BEEK, KARINE/F-1568-2012",,Israel Science Foundation [1097/11],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"We thank Jane Humphries, Kim Oosterlinck, and Nathan Sussman for their detailed comments, as well as Steve Broadberry, Nicholas Crafts, Alfredo Gigliobianco, Bishnupriya Gupta, Oliver Volckart, and other participants at the First Centre for Economic Policy Research Economic History Symposium in Perugia and at the Economic History Seminars at Oxford University and the London School of Economics for their helpful feedback.

Based on a study of Anglo-American brewing issues on the London market between 1888 and 1892, in this article it is argued that such an interpretation cannot be sustained. For these issues, securing access to the London market proved more demanding than accounts of its liberalism would lead us to expect: in fact, Anglo-American brewing companies submitted to strictures from London that were more constraining than those of the New York market. Promoters accepted London's constraints to take advantage of the high valuations assigned to Anglo-American brewing securities there, which reflected the city's success in building demand based on financial machinery that did not exist in New York. That machinery included underwriting syndicates, accounting standards, and the London Stock Exchange's listing rules, although, from this perspective, it was the rigour of the exchange's rules that was important. Still, vetting securities for quotation was not the same as for investment, as the disappointing performance of the Anglo-American brewing securities soon revealed.","[O'Sullivan, Mary A.] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"O'Sullivan, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In standard notation, technical inefficiency u is distributed as N (+)(mu, sigma (2)). This distribution is affected by some environmental variables z that may or may not affect the level of the frontier but that do affect the shortfall of output from the frontier. We will distinguish the pre-truncation mean (mu) and variance (sigma (2)) from the post-truncation mean mu (*) = E(u) and variance sigma (*) (2) = var(u). Existing models parameterize the pre-truncation mean and/or variance in terms of the environmental variables and some parameters. Changes in the environmental variables cause changes in the pre-truncation mean and/or variance, and imply changes in both the post-truncation mean and variance. The expressions for the changes in the post-truncation mean and variance can be quite complicated. In this paper, we suggest parameterizing the post-truncation mean and variance instead. This leads to simple expressions for the effects of changes in the environmental variables on the mean and variance of u, and it allows the environmental variables to affect the mean of u only, or the variance of u only, or both.","[Amsler, Christine; Schmidt, Peter] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tsay, Wen-Jen] Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Michigan State University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Schmidt, P (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",schmidtp@msu.edu,,,,,,,19,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The unique features of the mega-city of Chongqing make it a valuable case study to examine environmental pressures from rapid economic development at the city level. This paper reveals the socioeconomic drivers of environmental pressures in Chongqing during the period of 2000-2010 for energy consumption and air, water, and land emissions. Results indicate that Chongqing's environmental pressures increased for energy consumption and CO2 emissions white decreased for SO2, soot, waste water, and solid waste discharge. The main direct contributors, from the producer perspective, to the overall change of environmental pressures were the manufacturing, electricity and water, and construction sectors. From the consumer perspective, the most significant contributors were gross fixed capital formation and net export. In general, changes of per capita final demand and environmental pressure intensity were the most prominent drivers for increasing and reducing environmental pressure. Final demand structure and final demand composition also contributed towards stabilizing environmental pressures while production structure and residential population had a negligible effect. In this light, we suggest approaches for policymakers to systemically balance between different drivers and to reduce environmental pressures in cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate an optimization model to capture the effect of delay in evacuation, limited resource availability, and costs associated with resource allocation. A single chain closed queuing network model with class switching is used to model traffic congestion during evacuation. The throughput measures from the queuing network are used as inputs in the optimization model. Further, two resource allocation strategies are suggested and genetic algorithm is used for optimizing resource utilization and evacuation risk. The results indicate that pooling resources among a cluster of affected areas is most suitable for evacuation. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the time trade-offs and the effect of service time variability on the expected evacuation time. The proposed model can serve as an important resource planning and allocation tool for emergency evacuation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This notion, a third policy option for managing the commons, entails little or no state involvement. Under this notion, Ostrom developed eight design principles to which self-governing institutional arrangements adhere, while the role of the state is minimal. This article seeks to establish whether design principles characterize such institutional arrangements when the role of the state is accommodated explicitly within the principles. Drawing on a case study of present-day management of Japan's community-based coastal fisheries commons, our study shows that the design principles can better characterize self-governing institutional arrangements when the state adopts a pro-user self-governance role that provides strategic support for users, but neither takes ownership of the commons nor participates in engineering the institutional arrangements.

The defining characteristic of markets is interaction through trade. Two main dimensions are identified as basis for classifying markets in ES. Firstly, we have markets with and without intermediaries. Secondly, some markets for ES are created by defined liabilities like caps on emissions while other trades come about voluntarily. Altogether six forms of markets are identified, with two being incomplete. The paper also offers an analysis of the most important existing markets for ES using the developed classification. Regarding payments for ecosystem services (PES), most are not markets, not even incomplete. This is so as most resources are raised through taxes or fees command not trade. Moreover, most payments are best characterized as subsidies. Cap-and-trade systems like those for carbon qualify as markets, but depend crucially on the politically defined cap. Moreover, it is this cap that protects the environment. While the idea with markets in ES is to 'escape' command and control, it is observed that C&C is essential for these markets to work.

Engagement of civic society is crucial but disregarded by some of the advocates of the bio-based turn. Connecting society to this complex transition is difficult and so far insufficient. Technocratic one-directional communication strategies that aim to nurture public trust and support for the transition to a bio-based economy often backfire. Besides, 'tamed', institutionalised public participation approaches to legitimise policies may frustrate the public rather than facilitate engagement. What is needed is an approach that engages the public as active citizens, in an open-ended process. This pre-conditional 'state of engagement' can only exist when the public feels it holds a stake and has a voice. Initiating such engagement is not possible through rational deliberative processes. In this paper we consider and explore the value of emotions for strengthening public engagement. We argue for a mentality change with regard to the potential role of citizens in a bio-based economy.

Key limitations of simple models arise at very small scales, and in predicting specific future BES values; (3) training local experts in the approaches and tools is important for building local capacity, ownership, trust, and long-term success; (4) decision makers and stake-holders prefer to use a variety of BES value metrics, not only monetary values; (5) an important science gap exists in linking changes in BES to changes in livelihoods, health, cultural values, and other metrics of human wellbeing; and (6) communicating uncertainty in useful and transparent ways remains challenging. 2013 The Authors.

By investigating the roots and developments of environmental footprints and planetary boundaries, this paper challenges the isolation of the two research fields and provides novel insights into the complementary use of them. Our analysis demonstrates that knowledge of planetary boundaries improves the policy relevance of environmental footprints by providing a set of consensus-based estimates of the regenerative and absorptive capacity at the global scale and, in reverse, that the planetary boundaries framework benefits from well-grounded footprint models which allow for more accurate and reliable estimates of human pressure on the planet's environment A framework for integration of environmental footprints and planetary boundaries is thus proposed. The so-called footprint-boundary environmental sustainability assessment framework lays the foundation for evolving environmental impact assessment to environmental sustainability assessment aimed at measuring the sustainability gap between current magnitudes of human activities and associated capacity thresholds. As a first attempt to take advantage of environmental footprints and planetary boundaries in a complementary way, there remain many gaps in our knowledge. We have therefore formulated a research agenda for further scientific discussions, mainly including the development of measurable boundaries in relation to footprints at multiple scales and their trade-offs, and the harmonization of the footprint and boundary metrics in terms of environmental coverage and methodological choices. All these points raised, in our view, will play an important role in setting practical and tangible policy targets for adaptation and mitigation of worldwide environmental unsustainability.

In such situations, effective economic targeting of restoration is aided by an accounting of the spatially explicit linkages between initial restoration actions, the resulting changes in ecosystem services, and the changes in economic benefits to individuals resulting from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. To this end, we examine the impact of landscape heterogeneity on economic benefits of USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) restoration for ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) hunters in Michigan by linking a previously developed ecological production function of ring-necked pheasant sightings to a recreation demand model of hunter site choice. Using proposed pheasant habitat restoration in Michigan as a framework for our analysis, we find that economic benefits generated by restoration depend critically upon the landscape selected for CRP restoration. Poorly targeted restoration sites yield near-zero economic benefits, while well-targeted investments yield about 2.4 times the economic benefits of the median parcel. The results show how managers can use both ecological and hunter behavior information to enhance the return on conservation investments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We used multiregional input-output model of 30 provinces to reexamine the embodied emissions and to capture the interregional linkage in it. Results in 2002-2007 show that SO2 embodied in exports contributes 15.17-22.08% of the total domestic SO2 emissions, and 74.40-78.14% of the embodiment is in exports from the eastern provinces, where over 90% of China's exports occur. However, only about 70% of the embodied emission in eastern China's exports is discharged in the east; an increasing portion (24% to 34%) is released in the central and western provinces as a result of interregional production linkage. Moreover, the interregional connection becomes closer during the 2002-2007 period, which increases the scale and intensity of embodied emission in China's export given large gaps in emission intensity among regions. Further analysis on Guangdong, China's largest export province, shows that the SO2 emissions per unit of output induced by Guangdong's exports are larger than that induced by the province's own exports for most provinces, especially the central and western provinces which are restricted in exports and indirectly export by supporting Guangdong's exports via interregional economic linkage. The results yield important implications for China's export and pollution emission control policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The relative stability of the Canadian banks in the recent crisis compared to the US in our view reflected the original institutional foundations laid in place in the early nineteenth century in the two countries. The Canadian concentrated banking system that had evolved by the end of the twentieth century had absorbed the key sources of systemic riskthe mortgage market and investment bankingand was tightly regulated by one overarching regulator. In contrast, the relatively weak, fragmented, and crisis-prone US banking system that had evolved since the early nineteenth century led to the rise of securities markets, investment banks, and money market mutual funds (the shadow banking system) combined with multiple competing regulatory authorities. The consequence was that the systemic risk that led to the crisis of 2007-8 was not contained.","[Bordo, Michael D.; Rockoff, Hugh] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Bordo, Michael D.; Rockoff, Hugh] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Redish, Angela] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia,"Bordo, MD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,,,,,51,51,56,0,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We develop an ecological-economic model using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to assess and value the delivery of ecosystem services from riparian buffer strips. By capturing the interactions underlying ecosystem processes and the delivery of services we aim to further the operationalization of ecosystem services approaches. The model is developed through outlining the underlying ecological processes which deliver ecosystem services. Alternative management options and regional locations are used for sensitivity analysis. We identify optimal management options but reveal relatively small differences between impacts of different management options. We discuss key issues raised as a result of the probabilistic nature of the BBN model. Uncertainty over outcomes has implications for the approach to valuation particularly where preferences might exhibit non-linearities or thresholds. The interaction between probabilistic outcomes and the statistical nature of valuation estimates suggests the need for further exploration of sensitivity in such models.

However, there has been no such empirical research to explore the linkages in five selected New Zealand-UK international agri-food supply chains (dairy, meat, apples, onions and wine). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach - Before applying covariance-based structural equation modelling (a path analysis) on the data collected from 112 chain coordinators (CCs) (chief executive officers, managing directors and head of departments) of the selected agri-food supply chains, a comprehensive process of exploratory factor analysis, reliability and validity tests is used to develop the constructs. Findings - The findings suggest that CCs' participative leadership approach is highly significantly (beta = 0.60; p = 0.00) associated with the effectiveness of international agri-food supply chain coordination. Directive leadership does not have a significant relationship and its interaction effect with participative leadership resulted in a significant negative relationship with the effectiveness of agri-food supply chain coordination. Moreover, social (satisfaction with and trust in supply chain partners) and operational (service and product quality) dimensions are the major determinants of financial performance (profit, sales and market share) with beta = 0.44 (p = 0.00) and beta = 0.44 (p = 0.05), respectively. These variables jointly explain 70 per cent of the variance in financial performance, and leadership explains 36 per cent of the variance in coordination effectiveness. Practical implications - In order to understand the multiple dimensions of performance and their linkages, the study enhances the understanding of CCs and contributes to determine the best practices for modern agri-food supply chains. Originality/value - This study is the first step in developing and confirming complicated linkages with the specific characteristics of selected international agri-food supply chains. As a result, the empirical evidence also clarifies the earlier ambiguous results on the topic raised from other industries or countries.","[Akhtar, Pervaiz; Khan, Zaheer] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Akhtar, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",pervaiz_khan972@hotmail.com,,"Khan, Zaheer/0000-0001-5538-3123",,,,,53,12,15,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of wine consumers was selected in two denominations of origin (DOs): Rioja and La Mancha. Partial least squares method was used to estimate the measurement and the proposed structural model. A multi-group analysis was also employed to determine the main differences between both wine umbrella brands. Findings - The main components that contribute to the creation of brand image were tested: functional image and reputation, and affective image. The comparison found that the values obtained for La Mancha are significantly inferior to those of Rioja as regards affective image. Research limitations/implications - The choice of two Spanish wine regions and the analysis of wine consumers who were purchasing in wine shops suggest future research works that will consider not only extending the number of wine brands studied, but will also cover other kinds of commercial establishments, differentiating the place of consumption or suggesting a variety of wine styles. Practical implications - The results obtained suggest the relevance of DOs in the commercialisation of wines, and consequently the activities and alliances that should be developed to improve the main components of brand image. Originality/value - A multi-group analysis focused on two Spanish DOs has been used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each umbrella brand. The basis used for this has been the study of functional and affective aspects in one of the most traditional wine countries in Europe, Spain. This research is of value to academics, wineries and public institutions, as it may allow them to design marketing and commercialisation strategies.","[Aranda, Evangelina] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Appl Econ, Toledo, Spain; [Gomez, Mar; Molina, Arturo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Mkt, Toledo, Spain; [Gomez, Mar; Molina, Arturo] Univ Autonoma Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Molina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Mkt, Toledo, Spain.",arturo.molina@uclm.es,"Molina-Collado, Arturo/I-2655-2014; Aranda, Evangelina/R-3436-2017; Gómez-Rico, Mar/C-2735-2017","Molina-Collado, Arturo/0000-0002-6537-2468; Aranda, Evangelina/0000-0002-4438-7134; Gómez-Rico, Mar/0000-0002-7681-4794",,,,,89,13,15,2,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to draw on the literature related to the Heuristic-Systematic Model of information processing to provide a deeper insight into the factors affecting pro-environmental behavior intention. Design/methodology/approach - The framework highlights the moderator role of environmental motivation and environmental knowledge in the relationships among message framing and pro-environmental behavior intention. The study used an internet survey to help reduce the social desirability bias associated with a face-to-face survey. In total, 497 questionnaires were collected, of which 68 were invalid and 429 were valid. Findings - The results indicate that it might be beneficial for green marketing proprietors to provide product-related information stressing the potential negative consequences of not buying organic food products. This effect, however, is moderated by the degree of the customer's environmental motivation and environmental knowledge. Originality/value - This stands in marked contrast to the traditional information which emphasizes the positive consequences to motivate customers to purchase organic food products.","[Chang, Meng-Chen] Feng Chia Univ, PhD Program Business, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Wu, Chao-Chan] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Cooperat Econ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, PhD Program Business, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",nkwb200201@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,53,55,9,92,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, it has little policy impact unless connected quantitatively to the price of energy and other goods and services. I present an input-output (IO)-based method to do this. The method is illustrated by a two-sector model fitted to U.S. IO economic data. In an IO-characterized system, the energy returned on energy invested (EROI) and the energy intensity of energy are directly related. However, EROI and prices are not uniquely related because they depend differently on four independent IO coefficients representing internal structure of, and the relationship between, the energy sector and the rest of the economy. If only one of these coefficients varies, then EROI does uniquely determine prices. Uncertainties in the IO coefficients, as well as persistent issues of choosing system boundary and aggregating diverse energy types, further complicate the EROI-price connection. In this context I review two recent empirical comparisons of U.S. oil and gas prices and EROI for 1954-2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In total, three packages for food products and two packages for drink products were selected for the study, including snack pouches, tuna cans, ready-to-eat plastic trays, laminated juice cartons, and plastic bottles for drinking water. Packaging attributes that were taken into consideration were structure, body style, opening mechanism, reseal features, and tamper-evident characteristics. Part worth analysis and importance level of increased price factors compared with packaging attributes were discussed. Conjoint analysis was used for importance score calculation and data analysis. Findings - The most important packaging attributes for all packages were the opening characteristics. Tamper-evident characteristics were also perceived as very important for drinking water bottles. However, for all packages, the importance score level for the price factor accounted for only 10-19 percent. As a result, opening characteristics of the packages seemed to influence consumer purchasing decisions for food and drink products; most consumers were happy to trade-off on a slight increase in price for additional convenience or tamper-evident features of a package.

It is very important to reach political consensus in long-term on defining optimal reform strategies for local self-government in order to create conditions for developing entrepreneurship, strengthening cooperation with private sector and attracting foreign investments in local self-governments.","[Miletic, Vesna; Gavrilovic, Milica] Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Milosavljevic, Dusan] Tech Sch Zagubica, Zagubica, Serbia",,"Miletic, V (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",vmiletic68@gmail.com; mgavrilovic@megatrend.edu.rs; dusanmilosavljevic@hotmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,50.0,59.0,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500006,0

Design/methodology/approach - Annual time series data for 43 countries covering 1975-2009 that yields balanced panel were employed for the analysis. The convergence hypothesis is examined based on the neoclassical growth model using feasible generalized least square approach that is robust to autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence. Findings - The empirical results lend support to existence of convergence process in nutrient supply in SSA. Evidence of convergence in nutrient supply may have contributed to observed reduction in incidence of food-poverty in the region, which aligns with the argument in literature that recent Africa food security gains are due to food imports. The results of the determinants of change in nutrient supply showed that, global food trade represented by trade openness consistently increased growth in nutrient supply across countries in SSA significantly. Meanwhile, the speed of convergence of per capita nutrient supply, which measures how quickly growth in nutrient supply increases over time is very low, as this calls for urgent policy attention in the region. Originality/value - The very first study to investigate convergence in food consumption and nutritional supply in SSA.","[Ogundari, Kolawole] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ito, Shoichi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan",University of Delaware; Kyushu University,"Ogundari, K (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",ogundarikolawole@daad-alumni.de,"Ogundari, Kolawole/F-6700-2018","Ogundari, Kolawole/0000-0001-5714-4417",JSPS [24-02406],"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the JSPS toward his postdoctoral fellowship at Kyushu University, Fukuoka and also for providing Grants-Aid-for-Scientific Research-KAKENHI with ID No. 24-02406 for the research between 2012/2014.

The factors of e-participation were delineated from a review of democracy and e-participation literature and a regression model was developed. On the basis of 407 responses collected through an online and offline survey among the Indian participants, the model was tested. The analysis showed that the citizens' participation efficacy and values determine e-participation of both types. For the citizens' initiatives freedom to participate and legal support for the participation efforts were also the determining factors. The extant research on types of e-participation services is inadequate. The paper attempted to fill the gap and contributes in i) explaining the importance of facilitating multiple stakeholders' initiatives for improved citizens' participation ii) differentiating determining factors among e-participation initiatives and iii) suggesting policy recommendations for successful e-participation initiatives. The future research can focus on determinants for collaborative service initiatives from the citizens and government. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the stated policy goalswas to achieve lowcosts for pharmaceutical products dispensed in Sweden. We use price and sales data for off-patent brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals to estimate a log-linear regression model, allowing us to assess how the policy changes affected the cost per defined daily dose. The estimated effect is an 18% cost reduction per defined daily dose at the retail level and a 34% reduction in the prices at the wholesale level (pharmacies' purchase prices). The empirical results suggest that the cost reductions were caused by the introduction of a price cap, an obligation to dispense the lowest-cost generic substitute available in the whole Swedish market, and the introduction of well-defined exchange groups. The reforms thus reduced the cost per defined daily dose for consumers while being advantageous also for the pharmacies, who saw their retail margins increase. However, pharmaceutical firms supplying off-patent pharmaceuticals experienced a clear reduction in the price received for their products.","[Bergman, Mats A.] Sodertorn Univ, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden; [Bergman, Mats A.; Rudholm, Niklas] HUI Res, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Granlund, David] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Rudholm, Niklas] Dalarna Univ, Sch Technol & Business Studies, S-79188 Falun, Sweden",Sodertorn University; Umea University; Dalarna University,"Rudholm, N (通讯作者)，HUI Res, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.;Rudholm, N (通讯作者)，Dalarna Univ, Sch Technol & Business Studies, S-79188 Falun, Sweden.",nru@du.se,"Bergman, Mats/AGK-4123-2022",,Swedish Competition Authority,Swedish Competition Authority,Financial support from the Swedish Competition Authority is gratefully acknowledged.

I also argue that the development of notions such as ecosystem services and strong sustainability has been constrained by the dominance of neoclassical economics, which provides a linear conception of the economy and leads to an emphasis on weak sustainability, which in turn springs from an emphasis on substitutability and aggregate capital. When assessing the relevance of classical political economy for studying ecosystem services and strong sustainability I consider not only the contributions of the classical political economists, but also more recent contributions which draw upon the classical perspective, such as Piero Sraffa's and Amartya Sen's.

An increasing number of national and international strategies focussing on resource efficiency as a means for reaching a green economy call for such indicators. As supply chains of goods and services are increasingly organised on the global level, comprehensive indicators taking into account upstream material flows associated with internationally traded products need to be compiled. Particularly in the last few years, the development of consumption-based indicators of material use - also termed material footprints - has made considerable progress. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies to calculate material footprint-type indicators. The three prevailing approaches, i.e. environmentally extended input-output analysis (EE-IOA), coefficient approaches based on process analysis data, and hybrid approaches combing elements of EE-IOA and process analysis are presented, existing models using the different approaches discussed, and advantages and disadvantages of each approach identified. We argue that there is still a strong need for improvement of the specific approaches as well as comparability of results, in order to reduce uncertainties. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development covering methodological, data and institutional aspects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To challenge the economic growth paradigm, the concept and term degrowth has recently been embraced by various activists and scholars. Drawing on a body of evidence from cognitive science, psychology, and related fields, we argue that using the word degrowth might be disadvantageous in public communications about alternatives to growth. We begin by reviewing arguments in favor of the term. Then we outline three main counterarguments: First, degrowth has a downward orientation which triggers negative initial feelings due to the basic conceptual metaphor up is good-down is bad. This puts advocates of an alternative to the growth paradigm in an unfavorable starting position, given that subsequent thought will be unconsciously biased by the initial feeling. Second, more conscious reactions are likely to be negative as well because people unfamiliar with the term will (mis)interpret it as a contraction of the economy, even though it is not always meant as such. Third, degrowth repeats and possibly strengthens the growth frame and may activate undesirable frames associated with economic recessions. To conclude, we briefly discuss alternative terms and summarize key aspects to be considered for more effective communication. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A spatially explicit integrated assessment based on sequentially coupled models quantifies the impacts at a 1 km grid resolution in order to take into account the heterogeneity of agricultural production and environment. The CAP post-2013 will lead to a shift in direct payments from cropland to grassland dominated production regions as well as to a slight decrease in regional producer surpluses in Austria. The economic impact of climate change scenarios depends on the spatial location and the precipitation scenario. The CAP post-2013 will lead to intensification of agricultural land use in favorable cropland and grassland regions as well as to extensification in marginal areas. Regional climate change amplifies land use intensification with increases in crop and forage yields, e.g. in Alpine regions, and land use extensification with declining crop yields, e.g. in eastern cropland regions.

Gibbs models are used to decompose the conditional intensity of the spatial point process into trend and interaction components. The trend is composed of access measures (primarily different classes of roads) and three different interaction processes are tested: Geyer, area interaction, and Strauss hard core. While the models used have proved to be useful in ecology, we are unaware of any applications to establishment or firm data. In empirical application, the models yield intuitively appealing results for the trend component, and the ability to specify the interaction component gives deeper insights into interestablishment spatial dynamics than any previously published methods.","[Sweeney, Stuart] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sweeney, Stuart] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Social Behav & Econ Res, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gomez-Antonio, Miguel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Syst, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sweeney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Sweeney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Social Behav & Econ Res, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Gómez-Antonio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Syst, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",stuart.sweeney@ucsb.edu; mgomezan@ucm.es,"Sweeney, Stuart H/G-7024-2015; Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/Q-5859-2018","Gomez de Antonio, Miguel/0000-0002-7138-0587",National Science Foundation [BCS-0454993]; [ECO2012-36032-C03-01],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF));,We would like to thank the participants in the 55th European Regional Science Association and the 89th Western Economic Association International conferences and three anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The potential for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) options is becoming increasingly apparent; however, implementation is often limited by a poor understanding of their costs and benefits. This study compares the costs and benefits of a range of hard infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation options to mitigate flooding under climate change using data from two catchments in Fiji. We employ unique survey data to document the costs of flooding under various climate change scenarios. We then use a hydrological model to simulate the potential benefits of a range of hard infrastructure and EbA options and conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. We find that under reasonable economic assumptions, planting riparian buffers is the most cost-effective option, yielding benefit-cost ratios between 2.8 and 21.6. However, the absolute level of protection provided by this strategy is low. Afforestation provides greater overall benefits, yielding net present values between 12.7 and 101.8 million Fijian dollars, although implementation costs would be substantial. Planting floodplains and reinforcing riverbanks provide some monetary benefits that are lower than riparian and upland planting. Elevating houses is not economically viable under any climate scenario. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A common explanation is that stated preferences are generally difficult to measure. I argue that the key problems of the dominant survey approaches can be explained more specifically by their ambition to measure individuals' (maximum) willingness to pay (WTP). To estimate WTP researchers need to ask questions involving counterfactual prices, to specify doubtful implementation rules, and to aggregate preferences in a way that is inconsistent with political rights. The procedures engender problems with scenario credibility, incentive compatibility, adequate information provision, and democratic legitimacy. As an alternative to the standard stated preference paradigm I propose a democratic valuation approach (DV). DV measures the exchange value of public services in the political domain in terms of the aggregate valuation implied by the median preferred expenditure level for public services. The blueprint for survey design is the public finance referendum with multiple proposals. I suggest that empirically straightforward and democratically legitimate exchange values may be a more powerful input to public policy decisions than theoretically correct but empirically problematic estimates of mean willingness to pay.

This article estimates the magnitude of the various kinds of formalized relief for three present-day countries (Italy, England, and the Netherlands) in the very long run (1400-1850). The results show that in this period a substantial share of GDP, up to 3 per cent, could be spent on formal relief, offering subsistence to up to 8-9 per cent of the population, with a gradual rise over time and the highest figures being reached in the Netherlands in the eighteenth century. The three cases show a steep decline around 1800, a pattern found more generally in Europe. Next, these results are placed in a broader geographical perspective. This highlights the sharp differences within countries-which could be even larger than those between countries-and the high levels reached in the regions bordering the southern shores of the North Sea. In the last section, the results are used to discuss the possible causes underlying these long-run patterns and geographical differences, including urbanization, wealth, religion, and social-organizational features.","[Van Bavel, Bas; Rijpma, Auke] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Bavel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"van Bavel, Bert/K-1377-2015",,ERC [339647]; European Research Council (ERC) [339647] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"For their suggestions we would like to thank Guido Alfani (Bocconi), Mathieu Arnoux (ParisVII), Christopher Dyer (Leicester), Paolo Malanima (Catanzaro), and Claudio Tagliapietra (Bologna); and for commenting on an earlier version of this article we thank Guido Alfani (Bocconi), Richard Hoyle (Reading), Marco van Leeuwen (Utrecht), Peter Lindert (UC Davis), Maarten Prak (Utrecht), Danielle Teeuwen (IISH/Wageningen), and the participants of the Economic and Social History seminar, Utrecht; and for English language editing we thank Eileen Power.

Although innovation and sustainability are relevant concepts, they are not being considered together in the literature. Hereof, eco-innovation encloses both approaches. Design/methodology/approach - A survey with 581 Brazilian companies was conducted. The structure of influential internal and external factors was analysed by an exploratory factor analysis, and the relations between groups of variables identified in the study were verified through regression analysis. Environmental capability, environmental managerial concern and human resources were internal factors investigated in this study, and regulatory and normative pressures, cooperation and government support were the external factors. Findings - Human resources was the most important internal factor, followed by environmental managerial concern and environmental capability. Collaboration was the most important external factor, followed by normative pressures and environmental regulations, while government support was seen as deficient. Companies stated that these factors were important to adopt environmental practices and increase performance. Practical implications - Understanding why food companies adopt eco-innovation will help policy makers to develop specific actions to promote eco-innovations. For managers, it can be a relevant tool to identify which factors to invest, if the company is eco-strategizing. Hiring committed staff, top management green consciousness and collaboration with key stakeholders can boost sustainability. Originality/value - This study brings an innovative approach with robust theoretical support in a comprehensive conceptual model, gathering and investigating all relevant internal and external factors in the literature. Those factors are used in an integrated way in the final model for the empirical investigation, while the literature generally emphasizes only external factors.","[Bossle, Marilia Bonzanini; Vieira, Luciana Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Dept Business Adm, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [Bossle, Marilia Bonzanini] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Business Adm, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [De Barcellos, Marcia Dutra] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Management, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Bossle, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Dept Business Adm, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil.;Bossle, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Business Adm, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",marilia.bossle@ufrgs.br,"Vieira, Luciana Marques/E-4342-2010; Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/F-4508-2011; Bossle, Marilia Bonzanini/AAR-4923-2021; Vieira, Luciana m/GQH-9657-2022; Vieira, Luciana Marques/ABA-2328-2021","Vieira, Luciana Marques/0000-0002-3996-0901; Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/0000-0002-4311-2921; Bossle, Marilia Bonzanini/0000-0002-2917-4202; Vieira, Luciana m/0000-0002-3996-0901;",,,,,55,39,40,3,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Originality/value - Although halal logistics play a key role in supporting the halal status of any given halal foods, the demand for this service is low. Thus, this study contributes to the advancement of knowledge on the drivers of consumers' willingness to pay for halal logistics.","[Fathi, Elahe; Zailani, Suhaiza; Iranmanesh, Mohammad; Kanapathy, Kanagi] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Iranmanesh, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",iranmanesh.mohammad@gmail.com,"Iranmanesh, Mohammad/G-2321-2012; Zailani, Suhaiza/A-2968-2013; KANAPATHY, KANAGI/B-8748-2010","Iranmanesh, Mohammad/0000-0001-6964-6238; KANAPATHY, KANAGI/0000-0003-3710-2249",University of Malaya [RP016B-13SBS],University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the University of Malaya under the grant number of RP016B-13SBS, which have made the presentation of this paper possible.",,59,55,56,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As the well-being concept is holistic and includes different dimensions, the methodology on evaluation of the well-being on local level should be developed taking into account the peculiarities of the satellite towns. The aim of the paper is to analyse the well-being indicators in satellite towns of Latvia. Main results and conclusions of the paper: based on designed methodology on identification of satellite towns, 14 satellite towns around Riga were determined. The expert survey on selection of well-being indicators proved that indicators of different areas were needed to evaluate the well-being at satellite towns. The indicators related to remuneration, employment, demography, social safety and safety were selected.

A conceptual framework,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food poverty; Food policy; Food security; Hunger,EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INCOME; INSECURITY; PRICES; HEALTH; CHOICE; TIMES,"Purpose - Recently, food poverty has been subject to much academic, political and media attention following the recent reduction in consumer purchasing power as a result of food and energy price volatility. Yet the lack of consensus related to food poverty terminology acts as an inhibitor in both identifying and addressing the issue in the UK, specifically as a separate problem to that of food insecurity. Misunderstanding of terminology is an impediment to identifying similarities and differentials with both developed and developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues and enhance political and academic discourse. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory approach utilising secondary research was conducted to assemble sufficient information to ensure an extensive examination, consisting of several sources inclusive of academia, government and non-governmental organisations. The literature was screened for relevance following a broad search which primarily focused upon UK publications, with the exception of national data relevant to specified countries of USA, Canada, Yemen and United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania). Findings - Economic access, quality, quantity, duration and social dimensions were the common features identified in the majority of the literature. Based upon these elements the proposed concise definition was constructed as; food poverty is the insufficient economic access to an adequate quantity and quality of food to maintain a nutritionally satisfactory and socially acceptable diet. Originality/value - This study provides a conceptual approach in defining food poverty. Comparative to the countries examined, the UK has significant gaps in understanding and providing strategies in relation to individuals experiencing food poverty, causes and symptoms, methods of alleviation and coping strategies. There is no peer reviewed paper clearly discussing the definition of food poverty, hence, this review paper is original in three areas: establishing a definition for food poverty; clarifying the relationship between food poverty and food security; and discuss food poverty in UK with international comparison.","[O'Connor, Niamh; Farag, Karim; Baines, Richard] Royal Agr Univ, Sch Agr Food & Environm, Cirencester, Glos, England",,"Farag, K (通讯作者)，Royal Agr Univ, Sch Agr Food & Environm, Cirencester, Glos, England.",karim.farag@rau.ac.uk,,"Farag, Karim W/0000-0002-8828-2019",,,,,81,26,27,2,68,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Building on existing efficiency specifications, our proposal reflects the real banking technology and accurately models the relationship between desirable and undesirable outputs. Specifically, the undesirable output is defined as non-performing loans to capture credit risk, and is linked only to the relevant dimension of the output set. We empirically illustrate how our efficiency measure functions for managerial control purposes. The application considers a unique dataset of Costa Rican banks during 1998-2012. Results' implications are mostly discussed at bank-level, and their interpretations are enhanced by using accounting ratios. We also show the usefulness of our tool for corporate governance by examining performance changes around executive turnover. Our findings confirm that appointing CEOs from outside the bank is associated with significantly higher performance ex post executive turnover, thus suggesting the potential benefits of new organisational practices.","[Epure, Mircea] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona GSE & Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Lafuente, Esteban] Univ Politecn Catalunya Barcelona Tech, Dept Management, EPSEB, Barcelona 08028, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Epure, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona GSE & Barcelona Sch Management, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",mircea.epure@upf.edu; esteban.lafuente@upc.edu,"Epure, Mircea/A-8813-2013; Lafuente, Esteban/G-1593-2016","Epure, Mircea/0000-0001-7307-4906; Lafuente, Esteban/0000-0001-5889-7656",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2011-0075]; [ECO2010-18967]; [ECO2010-21393-C04-01]; [ECO2013-48496-C4-4-R],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ; ;,"We thank two anonymous referees, conference participants at the 2012 Asia-Pacific Productivity Conference in Bangkok and the XX Finance Forum in Oviedo for most constructive comments that substantially improved the paper.

Nowadays, it is quite usual for practitioners and decision makers with no or little knowledge in operational research to run their own efficiency analysis. Within DEA, several alternative models allow for an environmental adjustment. Four alternative models, each user-friendly and easily accessible to practitioners and decision makers, are performed using empirical data of 90 primary schools in the State of Geneva, Switzerland. Results show that the majority of alternative models deliver divergent results. From a political and a managerial standpoint, these diverging results could lead to potentially ineffective decisions. As no consensus emerges on the best model to use, practitioners and decision makers may be tempted to select the model that is right for them, in other words, the model that best reflects their own preferences. Further studies should investigate how an appropriate multi-criteria decision analysis method could help decision makers to select the right model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of total allowable catches (TACs) between species without considering fish community structure is altering the trophic interactions in the ecosystem and consequently impacts the natural productivity and the profitability of fishing. This paper aims to develop a methodological framework for assessing the composition and distribution of TACs within a heterogeneous fleet in a multispecies interaction system. The advantage of the presented approach combining a multispecies biological model with an economic model of individual vessel decisions is a possibility to analyze the harvest choice in the context of dynamic and changing conditions, where each action has a consequence for the future. An empirical application is provided for the Polish Baltic Sea fleet, where the most valuable target species is cod. The regulatory body sets the annual quota based on the target fishing mortality varying between scenarios. The net present value of the fishery in each scenario is compared by simulating stock changes over time and paired with stock collapse probability estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the substantial differences in regional socioeconomics, preferences for health care needs, and concurrent implementation of other health-related policies, the extent to which the impact of the NCMS differs in rural communities across China is unclear. The objective of this paper, therefore, was to explore the variation in the determinants of household enrolment and the impact of enrolment on health care utilization and medical expenditures in three large geographic regions in China. A quasi-experiment study was designed based on the panel data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The bounding approach was used to conduct a robust check of impact estimation under the assumption of unobserved bias. A major finding is that household income plays no significant role for enrolment, which indicates the equity of program coverage in income terms. However, regional circumstances matter. In the generally poorer western regions, households with a high ratio of migrant workers are less attracted to the NCMS program, and adoption of the program is related to the regional infrastructure environment variables in the eastern and western regions. The NCMS has improved medical care utilization for poor income groups and regions (western regions). The NCMS's impact on reducing the incidence of catastrophic expenditures is not shown for all regions.","[Liu, Dan] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Reg Econ & Finance, 211 Huiming Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dan; Tsegai, Daniel; von Braun, Joachim] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Litaker, David] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Case Comprehens Canc Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Tsegai, Daniel] United Nation Univ, UN Water Decade Programme Capac Dev UNW DPC, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Liu, Dan; Litaker, David] Heidelberg Univ, Mannheim Inst Publ Hlth Social & Prevent Med, Ludolf Krehl Str 7-11, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany",Sichuan Agricultural University; University of Bonn; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Liu, D (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Reg Econ & Finance, 211 Huiming Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",liudanren@googlemail.com,"von Braun, Joachim/AAA-7044-2020","von Braun, Joachim/0000-0001-6571-4838; Litaker, David/0000-0003-2676-7990",,,,,43,8,8,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Using multinomial logit model, I regress climate variables and other household level socioeconomic factors on crop choice. This regression result implies that crop choice is climate-sensitive. Households in the high rainfall areas choose rain-fed Aman rice as their dominant crop while farmers of low rainfall areas select irrigation based Boro rice. Using the estimated results,! simulate the impact of different climate change scenarios on crop choice and find that a shift in crop choices will take place in Bangladesh. Especially, temperature increase will upset rainfed Aman rice crop choice and make the farmers to choose irrigation based Boro, Aus and other crops. Unlike temperature, rainfall scenarios are not damaging for rain-fed rice crop choice. This paper also unveils a shortcoming of structural stability between different single cross-sectional models to simulate the effect of climate change scenarios on crop choice.

We allow for strategic sampling behavior of consumers under quality uncertainty and allow for strategic sampling to increase periodically as consumers' needs change periodically. We differ from previous work on forward-looking consumer Bayesian learning by allowing for 1) spill-over learning effects across different versions of products or products in different product categories that share a brand name and 2) duration-dependence in utility for a specific version of a product or product class to capture systematic periodic changes in consumer utility and migration of consumers across product versions or classes. We also assess the evolution of price elasticities in markets where there is consumer quality uncertainty that diminishes over time as consumers get more experienced. We estimate our model using scanner data for the disposable diapers category and discuss the consumer behavior and managerial implications of our estimation and policy simulation results.,"[Che, Hai] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 46202 USA; [Erdem, Tuelin] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; [Oencue, T.

However, the impacts they tackle can be part of a complex arena of socio-environmental conflict, where values and powers of business and local actors compete. Legitimacy of these schemes not only results from compliance by business actors; but also depends on acceptance by local actors affected by, or resisting the industries that these mechanisms aim to govern. This paper explores the influence of different local actors' values and powers on legitimacy granting or contestation by local actors during national processes of sustainability criteria development. We analyse the case of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in Colombia using an approach that combines concepts of ecological economics and political ecology with the legitimacy literature based on critical sociology. In Colombia, the palm oil industry led the initiative to implement certification under national interpretation of RSPO principles and criteria. However, the national interpretation process revealed power asymmetries among stakeholders and clashes between their different values. This resulted in strong contestation of RSPO legitimacy by local actors who resist expansion of oil palm cultivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on respondents' familiarity with the Port of Valencia and their pre-existing knowledge about the negative consequences of its potential expansion three clusters based on six indicators are identified.

Using firm level manufacturing data from 2003 to 2007, this paper investigates whether R&D intensity and various channels of knowledge diffusion affect productivity in Turkey-one of the fastest-growing emerging economies of the past decade. We find that an increase in the foreign ownership share in firms and technology licensing increases firms' productivity-although the conditional effect of the latter is significant only above a threshold of technological capability. Moreover, an increase in R&D intensity raises productivity only in firms with a threshold of technological capability, while industry level R&D spillovers do so only in firms with above average technological capability. These results support the view that emerging economies such as Turkey would benefit greatly from investing in technological capacity building, technology licensing as well as from attracting greater foreign direct investment.","[Ulku, Hulya] World Bank Grp, Dev Econ Vice Presidency DEC, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pamukcu, Mehmet Teoman] METU, Res Ctr Sci & Technol Policies TEKPOL, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",The World Bank; Middle East Technical University,"Ulku, H (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Dev Econ Vice Presidency DEC, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hulku@worldbank.org; pamukcu@metu.edu.tr,"Pamukcu, Teoman/ABA-5301-2020","Pamukcu, Mehmet Teoman/0000-0001-7633-9332","Research Center for Science and Technology Policies (TEKPOL), Middle East Technical University, Turkey","Research Center for Science and Technology Policies (TEKPOL), Middle East Technical University, Turkey(Middle East Technical University)","We are grateful to Research Center for Science and Technology Policies (TEKPOL), Middle East Technical University, Turkey, for financial support.

Studies of the global biomass metabolism investigate physical flows between and within nature and human systems, thus providing a useful basis for understanding the interrelatedness of changes in one place with impacts elsewhere. Various methodological approaches exist for studying the human-nature metabolism and estimating the land embodied in international trade flows, a core element of assessing telecouplings in the global land system. The results of recent studies vary widely, lacking robustness and thus hampering their application in policy making. This article provides a structured overview and comparative evaluation of existing accounting methods and models for calculating land footprints. We identify differences in available accounting methods and indicate their shortcomings, which are mainly attributable to the product and supply chain coverage and detail, and biases introduced by the use of monetary flows as a proxy for actual physical flows. We suggest options for further development of global land footprint accounting methods, particularly highlighting the advantages of hybrid accounting approaches as a framework for robust and transparent assessments of the global displacement of land use.

This paper investigates the position of the LCGP on the spectrum drawn by the KP and the APP using the theoretical ground of normative contestation. Results show that the normative stance of the LCGP is skewed toward the APP; however, the LCGP differentiates itself from the APP by its own functional properties and through its institutional fit with another regional institution, the East Asia Summit.

Specifically, we find that the price elasticity of nutrient emissions from agricultural watersheds is -0.17 to -0.34, suggesting that a 10% increase in nitrogen or phosphorus prices faced by farmers would lead to up to a 3.4% reduction in nitrogen or phosphorus emissions from a watershed. While this sounds modest, it is about the same size as estimates of the price elasticity of nutrient demand by farmers, a relationship which also is very inelastic. Our results suggest that when prices for nutrients rise, there is a direct effect on nutrient emissions from watersheds. Given recent concerns about phosphorus in Lake Erie, we assess the potential implications of applying a phosphorus usage fee to reduce phosphorus emissions there. We find that a 25% increase in phosphorus prices would reduce nutrient outputs from the three Lake Erie watersheds we modelled by 6.5%, or 210 t phosphorus per year, and cost about $6 ha(-1) yr(-1).

Recently, marketing researchers have started paying attention to different perspectives of ethnic consumption in intra-national contexts. Halal is one of such fastest growing ethnic food in western societies. The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively study Halal food consumption in majority ethnic groups in relation to possible resistances and acculturation in multicultural society of UK. Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire survey was used to collect data. Findings - The model was developed by using structural equation modeling (SEM) which shows that both consumer animosity and consumer racism negatively affect willingness to buy Halal food by majority ethnic groups whereas ongoing acculturation moderates these relationships. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this study is use of a combination of convenience sampling and snowball sampling. Practical implications - The findings can guide ethnic researchers and food marketers to devise prudent marketing strategies to deal with ethnic food consumption issues. Social implications - This study will bridge a gap in ensuring intercultural harmony by dealing with a market reality. Originality/value - This work has a potential to instigate future research in much needed area of changing food consumption behavior in multicultural societies and its implications.","[Ayyub, Rana Muhammad] Univ Vet & Anim Sci, Dept Econ & Business Management, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ayyub, Rana Muhammad] Univ Hull, Dept Mkt, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Veterinary & Animal Science - Pakistan; University of Hull,"Ayyub, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Vet & Anim Sci, Dept Econ & Business Management, Lahore, Pakistan.",drranaayyub@gmail.com,,,,,,,101,16,17,2,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Dittmer, K",,,,"Dittmer, Kristofer",,,100 percent reserve banking: A critical review of green perspectives,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,100 percent reserve banking; Full-reserve banking; Chicago plan; Monetary reform; Steady-state economy; Growth imperative,STEADY-STATE ECONOMY; ALLOCATION,"100 percent reserve banking (C-PeRB) is an enduring proposal for monetary reform that has been taken up by some ecological economists. This paper identifies three groups of green arguments in favor of C-PeRB, and offers some criticism. First, the proposal could serve to constrain new investments by the availability of savings, thereby checking economic growth. However, this would strongly increase interest rate volatility. Second, it could potentially elevate environmental considerations in decisions about resource allocation by increasing the role of the democratic state as an economic actor. This line of argument faces problems that require further detailed exploration and historical perspective. Third, a transition to C-PeRB would allow debt levels to be drastically cut. This is technically possible, but politically a tall order. Whether the existing system of 'debt-based' bank money generates a significant growth imperative is unclear, and the importance of other driving forces behind perennial economic growth in modern societies - which C-PeRB does not address - remains an issue of contention. In general, the adoption of C-PeRB presupposes a tremendous reconfiguration of power relations between states and finance capital. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidences from an emerging market,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,India; Consumer behaviour; Food products; Food retailing; Emerging markets; Agribusiness,INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; RETAIL,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and compare the factors which affect the consumers' buying behavior of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products in an emerging middle-size market. The paper also compares the preferences of the consumers for various food products and their respective market attributes. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 282 households of two middle-sized cities of India were personally surveyed with a structured questionnaire. Simple statistical analysis such as frequency distribution, factor analysis and analysis of variance, and logit regression were carried out to infer the required information. Findings - The results indicate that consumers consume more of vegetarian product than that of non-vegetarian products. Most of the consumers were interested in seeing and verifying the products of both of the categories before buying. Age and income of the consumers play important role in influencing their buying behavior for vegetarian food products, but not that of non-vegetarian food products. It was found that credence attributes of products, and market attributes play a dominant role in influencing the consumers' behavior for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products. Packaged branded products were not popular in both the food categories. Research limitations/implications - The localized nature of this study limits the scope of wider generalization. Future research could use larger samples spread across all regions having different food culture. Practical implications - The findings of the study will be of help to food retailers who are interested to know whether the consumers' buying process for these two categories of food products is more or less same or different in nature. This would help them to customize their product-specific marketing strategies as per the customers' preferences and requirements. Originality/value - The paper gives a comparative insight on consumers' behavior toward both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. It provides specific reasons for having different or similar marketing strategies for two categories of food.","[Kumar, Niraj] Xavier Inst Management, Dept Rural Management, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Kapoor, Sanjeev] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agri Business Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Kumar, N (通讯作者)，Xavier Inst Management, Dept Rural Management, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.",niraj@ximb.ac.in,,,,,,,69,10,11,2,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Investigating food safety awareness and routine practices is fraught with difficulties. The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a new survey tool to elicit awareness of food hazards. Data generated by the approach are analysed to investigate the impact of oberservable heterogeneity on food safety awareness. Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a novel Watch-and-Click survey tool to assess the level of awareness of a set of hazardous food safety behaviours in the domestic kitchen. Participants respond to video footage stimulus, in which food hazards occur, via mouse clicks/screen taps. This real-time response data is analysed via estimation of count and logit models to investigate how hazard identification patterns vary over observable characteristics. Findings - User feedback regarding the Watch-and-Click tool approach is extremely positive. Substantive results include significantly higher hazard awareness among the under 60s. People who thought they knew more than the average person did indeed score higher but people with food safety training/experience did not. Vegetarians were less likely to identify four of the five cross-contamination hazards they observed. Originality/value - A new and engaging survey tool to elicit hazard awareness with real-time scores and feedback is developed, with high levels of user engagement and stakeholder interest. The approach may be applied to elicit hazard awareness in a wide range of contexts including education, training and research.","[Millman, Caroline] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Jones, Davey; Edwards-Jones, Gareth] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Bangor University,"Millman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",caroline.millman@manchester.ac.uk,"Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009; Jones, Davey/AAD-6037-2020; jones, davey/C-7411-2011","jones, davey/0000-0002-1482-4209; rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740; Millman, Caroline/0000-0003-4935-0477","Economics Social Research Council [ES/G030782/1, RES-229-31-0003]; ESRC [RES-229-31-0003] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-229-31-0003] Funding Source: researchfish",Economics Social Research Council; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was undertaken as part of a studentship (ES/G030782/1) funded by the Economics Social Research Council, linked to Reducing E. coli O157 Risk in Rural Communities (RES-229-31-0003) funded under the UK Research Councils' Rural Economy and Land Use Programme.

J,"Shaw, C; Nerlich, B",,,,"Shaw, Christopher; Nerlich, Brigitte",,,"Metaphor as a mechanism of global climate change governance: A study of international policies, 1992-2012",ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Metaphor; Global climate regime; Climate change communication; Science-policy interface; Cost-benefit analysis,SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS; DEVICES,This paper explores the emergence of a global climate change mitigation regime through an analysis of the language employed in international science-policy reports. We assume that a global climate regime can only operate effectively on the basis of a shared understanding of climate change which is itself based on a shared language of governance. We therefore carried out an in-depth thematic and metaphor analysis of 63 policy documents published between 1992 and 2012. Results show that global climate science-policy discourses universalise the myriad impacts of a changing climate into a single dichotomous impacted/not-impacted scenario and aim to govern this world according to economic principles of cost-benefit analysis. These discourses use metaphors that draw on narrative structures prevalent in the wider culture to produce and legitimate a reductionist representation of climate change. This representation undermines public understanding of and engagement with climate change by marginalising subordinate policy framings which do not align with the prevailing dichotomous framing. The types of documents we analyse in this paper represent important sources for journalists reporting on climate change. We therefore suggest that any attempt to improve public communication of climate change should include revisions to these organisational discourses.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 364 NFSA employees representing all offices and organization levels and representatives from cooperating governmental and business organizations participated. Scenario encompassed a salmonellosis outbreak traced to nationally distributed cured salmon seasoned with non-irradiated imported dill contaminated with Salmonella. Crisis communication was included. Exercise evaluation included questionnaires to participants, monitors reports and interviews with NFSA key personnel. Results were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings - Participants and monitors judged the scenario as realistic and relevant and considered the exercise to have provided good learning to the NFSA. Some insufficiencies of log system, certain lacks of compliance with emergency procedures and some inconsistencies in crisis communication were reported. Following a broad evaluation process, the NFSA has carried out comprehensive revisions of contingency plans and procedures, conveyed the exercise learnings into an ongoing planning for reorganization, and has identified goals and methods for contingency training. Practical implications - Scenario, organization, methods for evaluation and assessments of learning effect may be applicable for similar organizations. Originality/value - This was the largest foodborne outbreak exercise ever conducted in Norway and among the few ones ever reported in scientific journals.","[Wahl, Erik] Norwegian Food Safety Author, Dist Off Trondheim & Orkdal, Trondheim, Norway; [Willumsen, Birger] Norwegian Food Safety Author, Bodo, Norway; [Jensvoll, Laila; Berglund, Turid Michelle] Norwegian Food Safety Author, Brumunddal, Norway; [Finstad, Ingunn Haavi] Norwegian Food Safety Author, Oslo, Norway",,"Wahl, E (通讯作者)，Norwegian Food Safety Author, Dist Off Trondheim & Orkdal, Trondheim, Norway.",erik.wahl@mattilsynet.no,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Suspension was accompanied by substantial inflation and the accumulation of public debt. By identifying shifts in the spot exchange rate of paper pounds for gold, I document how contemporaries' expectations of how debt would be stabilized in the future shaped the pound's internal value. Thus, it is argued that during the paper pound period, fiscal prospects provided a third mechanism, beyond monetary and real factors, affecting the price level.","[Antipa, Pamfili M.] Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Antipa, PM (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",pamfili.antipa@banque-france.fr,,"Antipa, Pamfili/0000-0002-8570-2217",,,,,64,7,7,3,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

The interaction mode may be correlated with the customer's unobserved valuation for the service, and this potential endogeneity is addressed using an instrumental variable. Specifically, the data indicate whether the customer's details were recorded in the company's information systems following an initial contact, such as the download of a free version from the company's website. The availability of such leads facilitated representatives' ability to contact customers, generating exogenous variation in the probability of interacting with a representative. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that such interaction lowers the total revenue garnered from a paying customer during the sample period. The primary driver of this result is a churn effect: customers who purchased online displayed a longer overall relationship with the firm, and were more likely to renew an expiring subscription. An alternative explanation, according to which representatives lowered revenues by reassuring customers regarding the adequacy of cheaper versions of the product, is not supported by the data.","[Eizenberg, Alon] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel; [Eizenberg, Alon] CEPR, London, England",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Eizenberg, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel.;Eizenberg, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",alon.eizenberg@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Eizenberg, Alon/0000-0002-7639-2384",ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [1338/13],ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION(Israel Science Foundation),"The author is grateful to a company in the High Technology sector for making their data available, and for their helpful feedback.

We consider the case of finger millet, which plays an important role in the food security of Nepalese poor and marginalized farmers. Despite such importance, production and consumption are decreasing as a result of, inter alia, the expanding availability of more profitable crops, a lack of awareness regarding its nutritional qualities by urban consumers and limited R&D dedicated to this crop. Nevertheless, the potential to improve the ability of farmers to capture the values related to the positive environmental and nutritional externalities associated with the production and consumption of local landraces, suggests that the conservation through use of such genetic resources can support the achievement of development goals. We analyse both the demand and supply side of a potential niche market for local finger millets. Using a choice experiment we find that urban consumers have a willingness to pay a premium price sufficient to compensate producers' conservation opportunity costs. We also identify a range of challenges for such an intervention to be considered effective from both an economic and ecological perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Afterwards, the paper will suggest the addition of a new model of humans that should serve as the base for the concept of law, the homo sustainabiliticus.

In this paper, we draw parallels between the current debate surrounding the Ban Amendment and contestations that occurred in the early years of the Basel Convention's Technical Working Group (TWG) over defining 'hazardousness.' Like the present debate, TWG deliberations involved a contestation between two divergent discourses concerning how hazardous wastes should be regulated-as ideally managed versus actually managed in the global South. Scholars have shown how the TWG is a site for industry to press for a definition of hazardousness favorable to their economic interests. However, explorations of the specific processes by which this occurred-particularly, how a framework for defining hazardousness that privileges private technical expertise over concerns of precaution and equity was successfully institutionalized within the TWG-have yet to be completed. We show that it is important to reexamine this debate today in order to better understand current Basel Convention developments.","[Lucier, Cristina A.] Lynn Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, 3601 North Mil Trail, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Gareau, Brian J.] Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Gareau, BJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Sociol, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",gareau@bc.edu,,"Gareau, Brian/0000-0002-0529-3389",,,,,33,12,16,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We find no effect on medium-sized communities.","[Chen, Yong] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall 219B,2591 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lewis, David J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall 200A,2591 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Weber, Bruce] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall 240G,2591 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Extens Hall 219B,2591 SW Campus Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",Yong.Chen@oregonstate.edu; lewisda@oregonstate.edu; bruce.weber@oregonstate.edu,"Lewis, David/AAH-4137-2022; Lewis, David/AFQ-9010-2022","Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189",Economic Research Service [58-6000-0-0053]; Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station,Economic Research Service; Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station,"The authors thank John Pender, Alex Marre, and seminar participants at Oregon State University and the Southern Regional Science Association Annual Meetings (SRSA) for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

This paper evaluates the effect of these reforms on the teaching efficiency of Italian universities during the period 2000-2010. We employ bootstrapped data envelopment analysis algorithms to assess teaching efficiency. Then, we examine the convergence of the Italian HE system using several panel data estimators. We find clear evidence that Italian universities have become more efficient over time, consistent with the goals of the BP, but that substantial improvement mainly occurs during the initial period of implementation. Our estimates also show a process of convergence in the performance of the Italian HE system, but we find strong evidence of persistent gaps at both university and regional levels. These empirical findings are robust to an alternative estimator, the empirical strategy, and the employed sample.","[Guccio, Calogero; Martorana, Marco Ferdinando; Monaco, Luisa] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Guccio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",guccio@unict.it,"Guccio, Calogero/M-4127-2015","Guccio, Calogero/0000-0002-1053-4968; Martorana, Marco Ferdinando/0000-0003-2616-4460",,,,,79,15,16,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It discusses the significant role played by professional engineers in the model's introduction, its extension at home, and its imitation overseas. It is argued that by 1931 the BSI catalogue of standards represented a considerable stock of codified knowledge whose growth reflected underlying aggregate technological opportunities, assisting in their transformation into technological advance. To help validate this claim, a measure of the size of the BSI catalogue of standards is incorporated into an econometric model of aggregate productivity growth in Britain. Findings show that the growth of the standards catalogue is associated with a substantial proportion of labour productivity growth over the period 1931-2009. Estimates relating to the short-run dynamics involved are consistent with the idea that there are causal linkages running from standards to growth. When interpreting these findings, it is argued that the overall weight of historical evidence points to standardizationcoordinated through the BSIas providing an important path of learning for the British economy over the period considered.","[Spencer, Christopher] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Temple, Paul] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",Loughborough University; University of Surrey,"Spencer, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",,,,UK Department of Trade and Industry; Research Institute for Capital Formation at the Development Bank of Japan,UK Department of Trade and Industry; Research Institute for Capital Formation at the Development Bank of Japan,"Financial support from the UK Department of Trade and Industry is acknowledged.

In this paper we study the effects of natural disaster risk on self-reported happiness and life satisfaction at the example of tropical storms. Combining several waves of the integrated European/World Values Survey and appropriate storm data we find a systematically negative effect of hurricane risk on both measures of individual well-being in relatively poor countries in which the population has little possibilities to take protective measures against storms. In highly developed countries, we find a systematic negative and much smaller effect only for life satisfaction. Altogether we conclude that disaster risk tends to play a role for individual well-being, especially on low levels of development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Quality as defined from an industry perspective usually relies on different instrumental assessment and on ratings of experts which may not necessarily align with consumers' perception of quality. The purpose of this paper is to deal with consumers perceptions of intrinsic quality in coffee from a sensory scientific and behavioral economic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - In a blind taste test (n = 205), naive consumers tasted two cups of coffee and decided which they preferred. The two coffees varied greatly in their objective quality (based on expert grading) and retail value. Consumers were then revealed that one of the cups contained a coffee that was much more expensive than the other, and that they could get a free cup of their preferred coffee if they could correctly identify the most expensive one. Findings - The results showed that preferences were equally distributed among the high- and low-quality samples, and that consumers did not perform better than chance level in the identification task. These results suggest that current grading systems used in the industry may be poorly correlated with the way consumers actually experience coffee, and thus that quality inference in the marketplace is more likely influenced by external cues (e.g. brand, label and price) than to intrinsic product quality. Nevertheless, the results also show that consumers who correctly answered the identification task were also significantly more likely to prefer the high-quality sample. This tentatively suggests that better sensory expertise is correlated with a preference for higher quality, though future studies are needed to confirm the correctedness of this interpretation. Originality/value - This work highlights the difficulty of objectively defining food quality, and the limited usefulness of experts' ratings widely used in the industry.

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was employed. Out of 978 responses, 548 (70 percent) responses which reported to have visited B&I food services more than five times a month on an average were analyzed by using structural equation modeling. Findings - The study results revealed that consumers' patronage intention toward sustainable B&I food services was well explained by the alternative extended TPB adding a new path from subjective norm to perceived behavioral control. The impact of personal moral norm on consumers' patronage intention was the highest followed by subjective norm, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. Originality/value - This study is one of the few attempts to clarify the underlying motives for patronizing sustainable food services. The study results may give insights into the mechanisms of consumers' patronage intention formation toward sustainable B&I food services and provide useful implications for strategic measures to promote sustainable B&I food services in Korea as well as other countries sharing similar concerns and interests.","[Kim, So-young] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, Asan, South Korea; [Yoon, Jihyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Res Inst Human Ecol, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Injoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Food & Nutr, Seoul, South Korea",Soonchunhyang University; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, SY (通讯作者)，Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, Asan, South Korea.",sonyah@sch.ac.kr,,,Soonchunhyang University Research Fund,Soonchunhyang University Research Fund,This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.,,86,7,12,2,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main aim of the study was to identify the most desirable attributes of agricultural property and to verify whether those features affect the prices of traded farmland. The survey was conducted in the region of Warmia and Mazury. A statistical analysis (a multiple regression model of real estate prices was based on the conducted transactions) revealed that the market price of farmland is affected by factors: the location of land relative to rural settlements, soil quality, land fragmentation, forest cover and location of farms in lessfavoured areas with natural handicaps for agricultural production. Location was the most robust predictor of agricultural property prices - about 1565.48 PLN/ha. Farmland situated far from rural settlements is associated with higher production costs and lower income. Soil quality was also an important determinant of property prices - about 574.88 PLN/ha. Land fragmentation and forest cover have a negative impact on property prices. Every additional land plot traded in a single notarial transaction reduced the price of 1 ha by PLN 60.88. A 10% increase in forest cover decreases the value/price of 1 ha of farmland by PLN 48.71. The price of agricultural property situated in less- favoured areas with natural handicaps (LFAs) was higher by PLN/ha 3 6 3.46 (EUR 1 = 4 PLN). The last attribute results from Poland's membership in the European Union and participation in the Common Agricultural Policy. The support scheme increased the prices of agricultural property. Results are largely consistent with the findings of international studies.

Design/methodology/approach - Six focus groups explored consumer responses to measures to intended to mitigate the emissions from, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. These included: meat reduction, greater reliance on seasonal British food, meal replacement tablets, laboratory grown meat, communal eating houses, genetically modified food and food waste. Practice theory provided the lens to interpret the changes to meanings, competences and materials associated with food consumption. Findings - Changes that could be assimilated within existing competencies were viewed more positively, with lack of competence a key barrier to accommodating change. At present, climate change and sustainability do not influence purchasing decisions. Policy measures delivering multiple benefits (win-wins), of which environmental performance may be one, stand an improved chance of establishing more sustainable practices than those focusing exclusively on environmental drivers. Originality/value - Awareness of the role of sustainable food systems in the context of anthropogenic climate change is growing. Whilst scientific and technological research explores methods for reducing emissions and building resilience in food supply chains to changes in climate, there is comparatively little study of how consumers perceive these proposed solutions. This research provides a comprehensive overview of consumer responses to potential changes in eating practices related to climate change mitigation and adaptation and is of value to policy makers, academics and practitioners across the food supply chain.","[O'Keefe, Laura; McLachlan, Carly; Gough, Clair; Mander, Sarah; Bows-Larkin, Alice] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"O'Keefe, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Laura.OKeefe@manchester.ac.uk,"mclachlan, carly e/I-6334-2012; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Larkin, Alice/R-4949-2019; Larkin, Alice/C-4698-2008","Larkin, Alice/0000-0003-4551-1608; Mander, Sarah/0000-0001-8492-6246; Gough, Clair/0000-0001-5063-9425","Sustainable Consumption Institute, University of Manchester","Sustainable Consumption Institute, University of Manchester","This research was funded by the Sustainable Consumption Institute, University of Manchester.

Design/methodology/approach - To measure the degree of acceptance or rejection that individuals have for foods that are unusual in their diets, a phobia scale was used to new foods developed by Pliner and Hobden (1992) Food Neophobia Scale (FNS). The authors also distinguished between individuals' predisposition to taste new foods, neo-phobic (lower bias) and neo-philic (predisposition). Additionally social and demographic variables such as age, gender, monthly income level and marital status to discuss relations with the FNS scale were incorporated. Findings - The results have shown that Mexican consumers show relatively low levels of phobia toward new foods, but there may be differences in accordance with the characteristics of the environment, the proximity of another culture or urbanization level have a significant influence on consumer attitudes. Originality/value - In Mexico the development of new foods has increased, in a recent study 83 percent of respondents indicated they are interested in buying new foods on the market. Studies of novel foods phobia have been made in various international contexts, in Mexico, however, the exploration and understanding of consumer attitudes toward foods that are unusual in their diets is incipient.

Marketing managers still face the challenge of broadening the understanding of how and why consumers purchase organic food. Specifically, a deeper understanding of the value dimensions consumers perceive in the context of organic food products is required to develop and implement successful management strategies which might transfer positive consumer perceptions to actual buying behavior and satisfaction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights on organic food consumption in different markets, this research investigates antecedents of organic food products and differences regarding the relative importance of the value-based drivers across two Western nations. Findings - The results from survey data indicate significant differences in the value perceptions, especially the functional and individual value perceptions, and recommendation behavior related to organic food for consumers from the USA and Germany. In addition, the segmentation approach provides evidence for consumer segments that cross-national borders: the convinced opponents, the silent/private consumers, the prestige-seekers and the passionate evangelists. Originality/value - Consequently, instead of a country-based segmentation approach, marketers should emphasize the different types of consumers across national borders in order to address the differences in customer value perception in the organic food market.","[Seegebarth, Barbara] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Mkt, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Behrens, Stefan Henrik; Klarmann, Christiane; Hennigs, Nadine] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Mkt & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Scribner, Lisa Luebbehusen] Univ N Carolina, Cameron Sch Business, Wilmington, NC 28401 USA",Braunschweig University of Technology; Leibniz University Hannover; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Seegebarth, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Mkt, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",b.seegebarth@tu-braunschweig.de,"Seegebarth, Barbara/IST-6757-2023; Seegebarth, Barbara/AAG-1485-2020","Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788; Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788",,,,,77,47,49,4,85,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Firstly, the report gives the definition of water resources carrying capability (WRCC), i.e. the ratio of water supply and water demand. Then we are to establish a model to measure this capacity from the aspects of supplying and consuming. Since the factors in water resources system are complex and dynamic, the System Dynamics model is adopted to the problem. The water resources system is divided into six subsystems which are interrelated to each other. The relationships of all the factors in the subsystems are to be analyzed to establish kinetic equation to quantify the issue.","[Song, Xiaojing] North China Elect Power Univ Baoding, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Song, XJ (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ Baoding, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China.",2394077164@qq.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,54.0,,,,,,400.0,405.0,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644200073,0

It is, however not clear to what extent consumers will accept different types of nanotechnologies in food products. The purpose of this paper is to research consumer attitudes towards differing applications of food nanotechnologies. Design/methodology/approach - Using an attribute -based approach, the authors compare a product with three different nanotechnology application types (during production, implemented in packaging and as additive to the -food) with the same product without any nanotechnology attributes. Findings Adding a nanotechnology attribute is shown to contribute to the overall product attitude, without substantially affecting the contribution of the other product attributes to overall product attitude. There are no indications that nanotechnology provides a non -compensatory harrier against acceptance. Risk perception increased for applications proximate to consumers while benefits remained similar across conditions. Practical - implications Low -distance applications (e.g. nano -additives that enter the body) are perceived as riskier, but not necessarily more beneficial, implying they will be rejected more readily by consumers. Food producers should primarily focus on reducing consumers risk perceptions of nanotechnologies and providing (and communicating clearly) the end -user benefits obtained from the technology. Originality/value - This study shows that introducing nanotechnology into a product has an almost uniquely additive contribution to attitude. The study aimed at relevant nanotechnology applications for food products, as opposed to general attitudes towards technologies. The study also confirms in an experimental setting earlier exploratory-findings that food applications closer to the end user are less acceptable and provides a case for nanotechnology-food innovations.","[Steenis, Nigel D.; Fischer, Arnout R.

These in-store FPS comprise of attractive packaging, accessibility, availability of foods in wide varieties and presence of helpful and friendly sales personnel. However, little is known about how children buy and the extent to which these marketing strategies are successful. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate food shopping behaviour of children in retail stores and to study the effectiveness of in-store FPS and demographic factors (age and gender of child and monthly family income) on food shopping behaviour of children. Design/methodology/approach - Data have been collected from 473 mothers of children in age category four to 11 years. Data have been analysed through descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations), bivariate correlations, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression analysis. Findings - The study explores and validates four factor structure of food shopping behaviour of children in retail stores in Indian settings. These factors include children's active assessment of foods, impact of availability and variety on children's purchases, influence of TV food ads on children's purchases and influence of packaging on children's food purchases. Further, the findings also reveal that in-store FPS are truly effective in influencing food shopping behaviour of children. Practical implications - Marketers may highlight packaging attributes in food advertisements as they can help escalate food purchase requests of children in retail stores. In addition to this, food advertising is strongly associated with assessment of foods in retail stores and looking for availability of advertised foods in retail stores. This suggests that food advertising as a medium of communication should not be ignored. However, sales personnel can also be used more effectively as they are seen to help children in identifying availability and variety of foods in retail stores. Originality/value - As no such study has been conducted so far (to the best of researcher's knowledge), this study potentially helps in bridging gaps in literature.","[Vohra, Jyoti] Khalsa Coll, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Soni, Pavleen] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Univ Business Sch, Amritsar, Punjab, India",Guru Nanak Dev University,"Vohra, J (通讯作者)，Khalsa Coll, Amritsar, Punjab, India.",vohrajyoti1@gmail.com,"Vohra, Jyoti/K-5396-2016; soni, pavleen/AAR-4858-2020; Soni, Pavleen/AAA-5187-2022","Vohra, Jyoti/0000-0003-2015-4210; soni, Pavleen/0000-0003-1787-4356",,,,,41,4,4,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In the subsequent rounds, the experimenters exogenously changed the resource size, including mild and strong reductions in the resource size and rebounds to original size. Results show that subjects react to strong reductions in resource availability, by increasing appropriation from the resource. This behavior holds for intense and persistent as well as for progressive reductions in resource availability. In addition, subjects that experience a reduction in the resource availability followed by a rebound to the initial resource size appropriate more than those subjects who did not experience any change in the resource availability.
