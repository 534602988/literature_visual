When transportation costs are high, both firms have lower profits with asymmetric information than with perfect information. Contrarily, if transportation costs are low, both firms may prefer the asymmetric information scenario (the informed firm always prefers the informational advantage, while the uninformed firm may or may not prefer to remain uninformed). Information exchange is ex-ante advantageous for both firms, but ex-post damaging if transportation costs turn out to be low. If the information is unverifiable, the informed firm does not represent a reliable source of information, since it always prefers to announce that transportation costs are high and there is no contract that induces truthful revelation.","[Brandao, Antonio] Univ Porto, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Brandao, Antonio; Pinho, Joana] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Pinho, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",jpinho@fep.up.pt,"Pinho, Joana/M-4008-2013","Pinho, Joana/0000-0001-6348-3108",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [FCT - DFRH - SFRH/BPD/79535/2011],Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors are grateful to Cesaltina Pires, Helder Vasconcelos, Ines Macho Stadler, Joana Resende, Paul Belleflame, Pedro Pita Barros and, in particular, Joao Correia da Silva.

In a range of models, changes in measured productivity are equal to the inverse of an export-share weighted average of changes in variable trade costs incurred domestically. Under certain conditions, despite the multiple biases in the CPI, measured real consumption captures the first-order effects of changes in variable trade costs on welfare. Through the lens of these results, we interpret some of the empirical work on measured gains from trade.","[Burstein, Ariel] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Burstein, Ariel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cravino, Javier] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Burstein, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, 8283 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",arielb@econ.ulca.edu; jcravino@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0962261],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank three anonymous referees, Costas Arkolakis, Andrew Atkeson, Arnaud Costinot, Robert Feenstra, Andres Rodriguez-Clare, Jonathan Vogel, and Ivan Werning for very useful comments; and the National Science Foundation (under Grant SES-0962261) for research support.

In the experiment, an initial income gap is caused by one of two kinds of tasks that the subjects performed. One task requires subjects' innate abilities for better performance, and the other requires simple efforts. This study also explores the effect of subjectively recognized reasons for income gaps on these preferences. The experimental results show the following: (1) Chinese donors are more generous than Japanese donors; (2) both Chinese and Japanese recipients are similarly greedy; (3) the causes of the income gap and subjective recognitions regarding this gap do not affect the redistribution preferences; (4) males are less generous than females in Japan but not in China; and, (5) Japanese donors become more generous when they did not expect to win the higher initial income.

To explain this fact, I develop a simple principal-agent model of start-up financing with both private information and hidden actions in which the equity investor can vary the level of control over the firm and the debt investor cannot. The model shows that when three commonly documented characteristics of the high-tech industry coexist, namely: (i) a high degree of information asymmetry, (ii) a high level of uncertainty about returns, and (iii) a large amount of R&D investments preceding production, then the ability to reallocate control rights that are contingent on performance becomes the key. Unlike debt contracts, equity contracts specify detailed provisions regarding the allocation of control rights. Thus, venture capitalists as equity holders have a clear advantage in financing young high-tech firms in places where banks are not allowed to offer equity contracts; in countries with no such restriction, they no longer have such an advantage. This result helps explain why most European governments' efforts in promoting venture capital activities failed to attract such investments in the high-tech sector.","Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Econ, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island,"Jia, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Econ, 550 Univ Ave, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",yjia@upei.ca,,"Jia, Ye/0000-0002-1394-062X",,,,,24,3,6,2,52,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The conventional diagnosis is that treatment is endogenous. This observation is also consistent, however, with anticipation effects that arise naturally out of many theoretical models. This paper illustrates that distinguishing endogeneity from anticipation matters greatly when estimating treatment effects. It provides a framework for comparing different methods for estimating anticipation effects and proposes a new set of instrumental variables to address the problem that subjects' expectations are unobservable. Finally, this paper examines a specific set of tort reforms that was not targeted at physicians but was likely anticipated by them. Interpreting pre-trends as evidence of anticipation increases the estimated effect of these reforms by a factor of two compared to a model that ignores anticipation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A New Approach,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange Rates; Gold Standard; Price Levels,LESSONS,"Some previous research has indicated that the classical gold standard led to greater price level co-movement among member countries than would be observed in later Bretton Woods and floating exchange rate regimes. This paper examines the subject of price co-movement under the gold standard with a set of recently developed techniques which examine both differences in the magnitude as well as in the sign of price level movements across countries, and which yield period-by-period estimates of how coherent price levels are across nations. Our results suggest that contrary to previous research, the classical gold standard did not appear to lead to greater price level co-movement. Neither, moreover, did the gold standard appear to move prices apart, as would be expected if two countries joined the gold standard with misaligned inflation rates. These results are similar to those of more recent research on the classical gold standard, in which previous purported effects of the metallic standard (on the cost of capital, the level of trade, and business cycle synchronization) have been found either to not exist or to be much smaller in magnitude than previously believed.","Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmt, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Using the updated version of the Chartbook of Economic Inequality, this paper provides new empirical evidence on the 'level' hypothesis and reassesses the empirical validity of the 'growth' hypothesis. In line with previous work, the empirical analysis on the entire set of countries and years under investigation does not provide any conclusive and compelling statistical support to either of the hypotheses. However, the apparent statistical insignificance of the findings does not rule out the economic relevance of the question at hand, given that the hypotheses cannot be rejected for important crises and countries such as the US and the UK. Hence, the overall evidence is far from being conclusive and there are several reasons to shed further light on this important research topic.","[Morelli, Salvatore] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy; [Morelli, Salvatore; Atkinson, Anthony B.] INET Oxford, Programme Econ Modelling, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England",University of Naples Federico II; University of Oxford,"Morelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy.",salvatore.morelli@gmail.com; tony.atkinson@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",INET [IN01100021],INET,"We acknowledge funding from the INET (IN01100021).

The result is obtained assuming that a partially-privatized firm maximizes a weighted sum of its profits and the total surplus. If, however, a firm is jointly owned by two different interest parties, the decisions must be made as a result of bargaining between them. This paper shows that the non-optimality result holds even if the privatized firm's strategy is determined by Nash bargaining between the private sector and the public sector. Although partial privatization is optimal for both cases, the optimal degree of partial privatization is different. It is smaller with bargaining than without bargaining. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using evidence of merchant steering based on the 2012 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (DCPC), we find that only a very small fraction of transactions received a cash or debit card discount, and even fewer were subjected to a credit card surcharge. We attribute this finding in part to the merchants' fear of alienating consumers, who may not view the steering attempts as an acceptable norm. Transactions at gasoline stations were more likely to receive either cash discounts or credit card surcharges than transactions in other sectors. Transactions over $20 were significantly more likely to receive a cash discount. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent study suggests that if the cause of confusion was properly controlled for, long memory and regime switching could be distinguished. Motivated by this idea, our study aims to distinguish regime switching from long memory for the financial time series. In this article, we model long memory and regime switching via the ARFIMA and Markov regime-switching (MRS) frameworks, respectively. A theoretical proof is provided to show that the time-varying smoothing probability series can induce the presence of significant long memory in the regime-switching process. We then propose a two-stage two-state-ARFIMA (2S-ARFIMA) model to control for the effect of the smoothing probability and use a simulation study to demonstrate that it can effectively distinguish the pure MRS process from the pure ARFIMA process.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Appl Stat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Shi, YL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Appl Stat, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",yanlin.shi@anu.edu.au,,,"Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Applied Statistics of the Australian National University","Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Applied Statistics of the Australian National University","The author would like to thank the support of the Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Applied Statistics of the Australian National University.",,7,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The subsectoral approach allows to retain additional information otherwise blurred by aggregation and to benefit from lower intra-sectoral heterogeneity. By employing a cointegrated VAR approach and accounting for structural breaks, we find long-run relationships for five of the eight subsectors studied. Short-run elasticities are estimated using single-equation error correction modeling. Granger causality tests and an impulse response analysis provide further insights into the relationships and dynamics of the variables, confirming the usefulness of the subsectoral approach adopted.

We find that self-determined formal sanctions schemes are popular and efficient when they carry no up-front cost, but as in Markussen et al. informal sanctions are more popular and efficient than formal sanctions when adopting the latter entails such a cost. Practice improves the performance of sanction schemes: they become more targeted and deterrent with learning.

Buyers dissatisfied with bids of incumbent suppliers can cancel their procurements and resolicit bids after qualifying additional suppliers. Recent cartel cases show that cartels devote considerable attention to avoiding such resistance from buyers. We show that in a procurement setting with the potential for buyer resistance, the payoff to firms from forming a cartel exceeds that from merging.

It is shown here that the rank-dropping behavior of the asset return matrix could be dealt with in rather a simple fashion: We first compute its singular value decomposition, and then, through this decomposition, construct, by the introduction of a homotopy parameter, a new matrix such that it has constant rank before a desired equilibrium is reached. By adjunction of this idea to the homotopy method, a simpler constructive proof is obtained for the generic existence of GEI equilibria. For the purpose of computing these equilibria, from this constructive proof is then derived a path-following algorithm whose performance is finally demonstrated by means of three numerical examples.

We present three alternative techniques for constructing representative points: a clustering method, an epsilon-distinguishable set method, and a locally-adaptive variant of the epsilon-distinguishable set method. As an illustration, we solve one- and multi-agent neoclassical growth models and a large-scale new Keynesian model with a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

Forty years after the implementation of the first equal pay legislation, the pay gap remains a key aspect of the inequalities women face in the labour market. While the overall pay gap has tended to fall in many countries over the past forty years, it has not closed; in some countries it has been stubbornly resistant, or has even widened. In reviewing the collection of papers that make up this special issue we identify four broad themes with which to group the contributions and draw out the explanations for diverse trends: theoretical and conceptual debates; legal developments and their impacts; wage setting institutions and changing employer demands; and newly emerging pay inequalities between and within educational and ethnic groups. Across the four themes we underline how the trends in the gender pay gap capture the dynamism of inequalities, as the market power of different groups and stakeholders changes over times. Three key dimensions emerge from the papers to provide a framework for future research and policy discourse: the relationship between litigation and bargaining strategies; the interaction between wage-setting institutions and new organisational practices; and the increasing and range of diversity or equality strands competing for equal treatment. We conclude that progress towards closing the gender pay gap will not be easy, will require a collective effort of various actors, and will not be quick.","[O'Reilly, Jacqueline] Univ Brighton, Sch Business, Brighton BN2 4QT, E Sussex, England; [Smith, Mark] Grenoble Ecole Management, Grenoble, France; [Deakin, Simon] Univ Cambridge, Fac Law, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Deakin, Simon] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Business Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Burchell, Brendan] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Brighton; Grenoble Ecole Management; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"O'Reilly, J (通讯作者)，Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Mithras House,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4QT, E Sussex, England.",jo72@brighton.ac.uk,"O'Reilly, Jacqueline/HCI-8567-2022; O'Reilly, Jacqueline/Q-2384-2019","O'Reilly, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6223-154X; O'Reilly, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6223-154X; burchell, brendan/0000-0002-8243-937X; Deakin, Simon/0000-0002-1725-5216; SMITH, Mark/0000-0001-9005-3103",,,,,73,43,52,3,102,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Rational choice assumptions continue to be dominant in discrete choice experiments (DCEs). One reason why affect has been ignored is that immediate affect during the choice process cannot be seen or measured easily. Consequently, most prior work on affect focuses on self-reports, which may be unreliable and merely self-justifications. Thus, we do not know whether immediate affect actually plays a key role in consumer choices. We addressed this gap by testing whether immediate affect can be observed in fairly trivial choices, and we tried to identify the drivers of and contexts in which affect occurs. We used a novel combination of eye tracking and facial electromyography (fEMG) methods to observe and measure integral affect for each choice option in a DCE. Results indicate the feasibility of the combination of eye tracking and fEMG during DCEs, the existence of affect in stated choice experiments for fairly trivial product categories, and provide insights into drivers and contexts of affective choice processes. Among others, best and worst task frames show to influence integral affect in DCEs. Findings stress the need for future joint investigations of cognitive and affective processes in consumer choice tasks. Better understanding of these processes should lead to valuable insights into how real-time marketing actions influence decisions, ways to improve the predictive performance of choice models, and novel ways to help consumers and organizations make better decisions.

Difference-in-difference estimates provide little evidence that state and federal minimum wage increases between 1996 and 2007 reduced poverty, material hardship, or receipt of public program benefits among all individuals, workers, younger individuals without high school degrees, or younger black individuals. Our findings are robust across several measures of hardship, including poverty, financial hardship, housing stress, food insecurity, durable goods deprivation, and health insecurity.

Firms owned or managed by women (female firms) use smaller amounts and less heterogeneous sources of external finance than their male counterparts. According to statistical evidence, female firms have difficulty in accessing bank finance: on the demand side, they apply for bank loans less frequently, as they more often anticipate a rejection; on the supply side, they experience a higher rejection rate. Econometric analysis shows that these different patterns are largely explained by the characteristics (such as business size, age, and sector of activity) that make female firms structurally different from those led by men, without leaving room for a significant gender effect. An additional contribution of this article is to compare the major euro-area countries within a homogeneous framework: weak evidence of gender discrimination appears in the supply of bank loans in Germany, Italy, and Spain, while some demand obstacles arise in France.

A theory of education is built and contrasted empirically to find that (i) option value explains a large part of returns to enrollment, (ii) enrollment in academic two-year colleges is driven by the option to transfer up, and (iii) the value of the stepping stone is small.","Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Trachter, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",nicholas.trachter@rich.frb.org,,,,,,,27,10,16,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Of course, tenure status is not exogenous and households' tenure choices may have important public policy implications, particularly since higher levels of homeownership have been shown to correlate strongly with various indicators of improved neighborhood quality. Indeed, numerous policies including that of mortgage interest deduction (MID) have been implemented with the express purpose of promoting homeownership. This paper presents an ESM with simultaneous rental and purchase markets in which tenure choice is endogenized and neighborhood quality is partly determined by neighborhood composition. The public policy relevance of the model is shown through a calibration exercise for Boston, Massachusetts, which explores the impacts of various reforms to the MID policy. The simulations confirm some of the arguments made about reforming MID but also demonstrate how the complex patterns of behavioral change induced by policy reform can lead to unanticipated effects. The results suggest that it may be possible to reform MID while maintaining the prevailing rates of homeownership and reducing the federal budget deficit (C) 2014 The Authors.

We employ a multinomial logit model to empirically investigate the likelihood of changes to personal income tax, corporate income tax, and provincial sales tax rates by Canadian provincial governments over the period 1973-2010. Our results indicate that provincial governments that start with higher tax rates are more likely to cut, and less likely to raise, their tax rates. Another important implication of our results is that ideology matters-provinces with left-leaning governments are less likely to cut and more likely to raise their tax rates.

More recently, attention has focused on comparative studies in economics and business in an international framework and problems related to the hypothesis of relative risk aversion (RRA). One ambiguous hypothesis is the relationship between the level of RRA and the level of education, which has been found either positive or negative. From a causality point of view, it may be argued that investors with a high level of education are less risk averse, but it may also be argued that less risk-averse individuals choose to pursue a higher level of education. The purpose of this paper is to survey the empirical literature on this subject. It provides evidence that risk aversion is negatively correlated with higher education and human development. The results have important implications for macroeconomic empirical studies and the demand for financial assets and more specifically on the demand for life insurance. Assuming the same degree of RRA for utility-maximizing consumers should be limited to homogeneous samples.","INSEEC Business Sch, Paris, France",Groupe Inseec,"Outreville, JF (通讯作者)，INSEEC Business Sch, Paris, France.",,,"Outreville, J.

Our key finding is robust to alternative lag structures, conditioning variables, inequality measures, volatility indicators, time periods, and panel estimators. Our key finding does change for asymmetric effects, where larger growth volatility positively and significantly associates with higher income inequality only for positive economic growth.

(J Int Econ 71:113-132 2007) which studies trade and macroeconomic behaviour in a two-country model under a reference currency such as the dollar in US-China trade. The home country (e.g. the US) sets its export prices in dollars and so does the foreign country (e.g. China), so that the US has Local Currency Pricing (LCP) of its imports while China has Producer Currency Pricing (PCP) of its imports. We crucially modify their model by adding the large and by now well-known trade in intermediate goods. The addition implies that there is now exchange-rate pass-through via intermediate-goods markets into US import prices which thereby become to some degree PCP like China; accordingly monetary expansion in the US now produces not merely an expansion effect in both countries but also an expenditure-switching effect towards itself by lowering its exchange rate and so raising the relative US consumer prices of Chinese goods. This modification has implications for the effects of monetary policy in both countries.","[Wang, Chan] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Study, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Adv Study, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Wuhan University; Shenzhen University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wangchanist@gmail.com; Hzoucema@gmail.com,"Wang, Chan/AAB-9870-2019","Wang, Chan/0000-0001-6371-7197",,,,,43,5,5,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In contrast to Klein's (1996) model, jumps allow not only for sudden changes in stock prices and firm values, but also for a firm to default instantaneously because of an unexpected drop in its value. Therefore, our model is able to provide sufficient conceptual insights about the economic mechanism of vulnerable option pricing. In particular, an analytical pricing formula for vulnerable European options under jump diffusion model is derived. The numerical results show that a jump occurrence in firm values can increase the likelihood of default and reduce the vulnerable option prices.","[Xu, Weidong; Xiao, Weilin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Weijun] S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; South China University of Technology,"Xu, WJ (通讯作者)，S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wjlk.xu@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,8,9,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

There were no value-adding linkages with the domestic economy, home-grown export champions, program for upgrading and infrastructure and support institutions for national producers. The failure is due to the absence of systemic governance and policy coherence.

For this purpose, we use the fully modified OLS method and second-generation unit root analysis to investigate the level of competition across two-digit manufacturing sectors. The results are robust and consistent with similar studies, leading to the rejection of perfect collusion and perfect competition, while providing evidence in favour of monopolistic competition. Similarly to other empirical studies, H-statistics are shown to be heterogeneous across manufacturing sectors. We argue that more concentrated sectors such as food and beverages, motor vehicles and furniture have low levels of H-statistic being thus less competitive than other industries (i.e. computers transportation equipment, printing and chemicals), where the H-statistic is closer to unity.

We investigate how subjects decide on prices and quantities in response to signals from the firms' internal conditions, i.e., individual profits, excess demand, and excess supply, and the market environment, i.e., aggregate price level. We find persistent heterogeneity in individual behavior, with about 46% of market followers, 28% profit-adjusters and 26% demand adjusters. Nevertheless, prices and quantities tend to converge to the monopolistically competitive equilibrium and we find that subjects' behavior is well described by learning heuristics.

Between 2002 and 2004, the relative supply of more-educated workers to less-educated workers remained constant while their relative wages decreased in favour of less-educated workers. However, between 2004 and 2010, the relative supply of more-educated workers to less-educated workers rose, while their relative wages remained constant or kept increasing in favour of more-educated workers. This suggests factors other than those implied by a simple supply-demand model are involved, such as skill-biased technical change or minimum wage variations. The decomposition of wage inequality reveals that the price (wage) effect dominates the composition effect particularly in the first period. Our results show that the real minimum wage hike in 2004 corresponds to a major institutional change, which proved to be welfare-increasing in terms of wage inequality. The upper-tail (90/50) wage inequality decreased between 2002 and 2004 and stayed constant thereafter, whereas the lower-tail (50/10) wage inequality decreased throughout the period. Our findings thus provide evidence supporting the institutional argument for explaining wage inequality.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; Kings Coll Hosp London, London SE5 8RX, England; [Bakis, Ozan] TUSIAD Sabanci Univ Competitiveness Forum, Istanbul, Turkey; [Polat, Sezgin] GIAM Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Imperial College London; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital; Sabanci University; Galatasaray University,"Bakis, O (通讯作者)，TUSIAD Sabanci Univ Competitiveness Forum, Istanbul, Turkey.",bakis@sabanciuniv.edu; sezginpolat@gmail.com,"Bakis, Ozan/AAE-4941-2019; Polat, Sezgin/M-8104-2016","Bakis, Ozan/0000-0001-9785-1992; Polat, Sezgin/0000-0002-8902-1312",,,,,30,12,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The nonlinear smooth-transition autoregressive model outperforms the linear autoregressive model in point forecasts at longer horizons, but the linear autoregressive and nonlinear smooth-transition autoregressive models perform equally at short horizons. In addition, we generally do not find major differences in performance for the interval and density forecasts between the linear and nonlinear models. Finally, in a dynamic 25-step ex-ante and interval forecasting design, we, once again, do not find major differences between the linear and nonlinear models. In sum, we conclude that when forecasting regional housing prices in the United States, generally the additional costs associated with nonlinear forecasts outweigh the benefits for forecasts only a few months into the future.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605; BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,47,17,18,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because builders can use their buildings for nonrational or non-pecuniary gains, it is widely believed that height competition occurs near the business cycle peaks. This would suggest that extreme building height is a leading indicator of GDP, since the tallest buildings are likely to be completed at or near the peak of a cycle. To test these claims, first we look at both the announcement and the completion dates for record-breaking buildings and find there is very little correlation with the business cycle. Second, cointegration and Granger causality tests show that while height and output are cointegrated, height does not Granger cause output.

The time span of our data from 2001 to 2014 includes the global financial crisis. We find that the forecasting ability of the models depends on both the forecasting horizon and the moment in time when the forecasts are done. The empirical evidence derived from our investigation suggests that no single model is the best one, but models that include a cyclical component tend to perform better than others.

This paper argues that an important cause of this convexification was an exogenous increase in the demand for skilled labour: the increased demand stimulated a supply response, and the supply of intermediate-educated workers further increased the demand for college-educated workers because these two types of labour are complementary. This argument is supported by an empirical equilibrium model of savings and educational choices for Mexico, where the degree of convexification was amplified by loosening credit constraints.","[Binelli, Chiara] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Binelli, Chiara] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Southampton,"Binelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",chiara.binelli@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,1,2,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We develop a tractable model with frictions in both credit and labor markets to study the aggregate and micro-level implications of a credit crunch i.e., a sudden tightening of collateral constraints. When we simulate a credit crunch calibrated to match the observed decline in the ratio of debt to non-financial assets of the United States business sector following the 2007-2008 crisis, our model generates a sharp decline in output explained by a drop in aggregate total factor productivity and investment-and a protracted increase in unemployment. We then explore the micro-level impact by tracking the employment dynamics for firms of different sizes and ages. The credit crunch causes a much larger reduction in the net employment growth rate of small, young establishments relative to that of large, old producers, consistent with the recent empirical findings in the literature.

Unlike previous studies, it conceptualizes economic growth into two sectors (agricultural and industrial) and categorizes terrorism into three forms (domestic, international, and suicide). It offers a modified theory of hard targets, where richer industrial, but not richer agricultural, countries are more likely to attract suicide attacks. A cross-national, time-series data analysis of 127 countries for 1970-2007 shows evidence that when countries enjoy high levels of industrial growth, they are less disposed to domestic and international terrorist events, but are more likely to experience suicide attacks. These findings indicate that economic growth is not a cure-all solution for terrorism because it may be associated in some instances with more terrorist incidents. Nonetheless, healthy economic conditions are, without doubt, beneficial to the war on terrorism because the majority of suicide attacks occur in only a few countries.","Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Choi, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",whanchoi@uic.edu,,,,,,,58,56,61,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our analysis suggests that sticky-price and sticky-information models fit standard macroeconomic time series comparably well. However, the model with information rigidity responds differently to anticipated shocks and persistent zero lower bound episodes-to a degree important for monetary policy and for understanding the effects of fundamental disturbances when monetary policy cannot adjust. These differences may be important for understanding other policy issues as well, such as fiscal multipliers. Despite these differences, many aspects of effective policy strategy are common across the two models: in particular, highly inertial interest rate rules that respond to nominal income or the price level perform well, even when hit by adverse supply shocks or large demand shocks that induce the zero-lower bound. Rules that respond to the level or change in the output gap can perform poorly under those conditions.","[Chung, Hess; Herbst, Edward; Kiley, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Chung, H (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",hess.t.chung@frb.gov; edward.p.herbst@frb.gov; michael.t.kiley@frb.gov,"Kiley, Michael T/H-1132-2012","Kiley, Michael/0000-0003-0427-0131; Herbst, Edward/0009-0008-0921-3738",,,,,63,14,15,2,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

Using secondary data along with methodological measurement, this paper provides representative information about citizens' perceptions about the influence of public institutions quality improvement actions on citizen satisfaction and public institution's performance quality. Research findings present the importance of citizens' satisfaction survey results as a possibility to find service quality improvement areas by using different quality management practices as well as to increase citizens' satisfaction on perceived service quality. Developed and explored reference model integrates different relationships between public institutions' quality practices and infrastructure quality, and application waiting time and information quality. Moreover, the relationship between public institutions performance quality and public institutions' quality practices shows the importance of continuous improvement initiatives. Reference model tested on the secondary statistical data presents evidence and provides informative results in order to take effective decisions.","[Daunoriene, Asta; Zekeviciene, Alma] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Daunoriene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.daunoriene@ktu.lt; alma.zekeviciene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,58,4,4,2,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results show a statistically significant non-linear relationship between the government debt to GDP ratio and the per capita GDP growth rate for all the analyzed countries. We have found that the government debt turning point is around 50%. If the government debt to GDP ratio exceeds this level, it could generate a negative impact on the GDP growth rate. The 95% confidence intervals for the debt turning point start as low as 40% of GDP, which calls for more prudent government debt policies.","[Dinca, Gheorghita; Dinca, Marius Sorin] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Dept Finance & Accounting, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Dinca, MS (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Dept Finance & Accounting, Brasov, Romania.",marius.dinca@unitbv.ro,"Dinca, Marius Sorin/AAE-6395-2019; Dinca, Marius Sorin/Q-2388-2015","Dinca, Marius Sorin/0000-0003-0527-3297; Dinca, Gheorghita/0000-0003-4758-9556",,,,,23,7,8,0,22,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating foreign exchange position. The study, therefore, employs a dynamic panel model to test the hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance lends strength to a currency and vice versa, using 20 SSA economies for the period from 1991 to 2010. This study finds a negative and significant relationship between monetary policy and EMP, implying an easing of EMP in the face of contractionary monetary policy. The findings also point to significant relations between aggregate output, levels of public debt, the current account balance, terms of trade and EMP. Findings of this study have important implications as regards the policy direction on exchange rate and currency management.","[Fiador, Vera Ogeh; Biekpe, Nicholas] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, V&A Waterfront, ZA-8002 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Biekpe, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, V&A Waterfront, 9 Portswood Rd, ZA-8002 Cape Town, South Africa.",nicholas.biekpe@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Biekpe, Prof Nicholas/AHB-9529-2022; Fiador, Vera Ogeh/AAT-6412-2021; Biekpe, Nicholas/GNH-1675-2022","Biekpe, Nicholas/0000-0002-9702-1232",,,,,38,2,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The increasing proportion of the young working age population in Iran has difficulty establishing families. This has increased political concerns about addressing the basic needs of young Iranians. This study examines the link between housing costs and the marriage rate in Iran, controlling for other relevant economic determinants of marriage. Using a panel of provinces of Iran over a period of nine years (2002-2010) and applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, our results reveal that there is a negative relationship between housing costs and the marriage rate. We also find that government special loans for marriage, and a lower unemployment rate, increase the marriage rate. Finally, increasing spending on higher education has a dampening effect on the marriage rate. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because most employment in low and middle income countries is in micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, governments, non-governmental organizations and donors spend on targeted programs and broader policies to enhance employment creation in these firms. But despite these efforts, not much is known about which of these interventions are really effective. This systematic review synthesizes the existing evidence on the employment impact of these programs. The results show that the effects have so far been very modest. Even if many interventions were relatively successful in boosting self-employment, expanding employment in already existing firms is generally more difficult but eventually easier in somewhat larger firms compared to very small firms. This finding is also true in relative terms, but it is probably not fully independent from the contexts in which firms of different sizes have been observed. The effects of finance interventions have on average been weaker than the effects of entrepreneurship training or business development services. Our study also reveals that about a third of the interventions covered by this review are not primarily designed to create employment but rather strive for income stabilization and poverty reduction. A further striking finding is that the study design matters for the impacts found; randomized controlled trials find systematically smaller effects than quasi-experimental studies. A significant shortcoming of the literature is that almost nothing is known about long term effects and cost-effectiveness and many studies fail to provide a detailed analysis of why certain effects occurred or did not occur making it hard to extrapolate lessons.

Our approach showed that such reactions are found for each group of assets: foreign exchange rates, stock indices and bonds.","[Hurduzeu, Gheorghe; Musetescu, Radu Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Int Business & Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Meghisan, Georgeta Madalina] Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Craiova, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Craiova,"Hurduzeu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Int Business & Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",Gheorghe.Hurduzeu@rei.ase.ro; madalina_meghisan@yahoo.com,"Musetescu, Radu Cristian/B-6311-2015; Meghisan-Toma, Georgeta-Madalina/ABE-7789-2021; Hurduzeu, Gheorghe/Q-9006-2017; Musetescu, Radu Cristian/A-3948-2016; Meghisan-Toma, Georgeta-Madalina/B-6944-2012","Hurduzeu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-1929-1851; Musetescu, Radu Cristian/0000-0003-1964-9048; Meghisan-Toma, Georgeta-Madalina/0000-0003-4531-9085",,,,,22,1,2,0,19,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The payment cost is borne by the seller, depending on the payment instrument the buyer chooses, cash or card. Card payment is more costly than cash payment, so the seller prefers that the buyer pays cash. In this article, we study the strategy of the seller setting a convenient price, which simplifies transactions and pushes the buyer to pay cash. The theoretical analysis, which models both the seller and the buyer in a game setting, derives two propositions: (1) the seller is more likely to set a more convenient price and (2) the buyer is more likely to pay cash a more convenient price. The empirical analysis supports both propositions. Thus, sellers adopt a convenience pricing strategy - prices for cash - and this strategy pushes buyers to pay cash - cash for prices.","[Karoubi, Bruno] Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE, F-76130 Creteil, France; [Chenavaz, Regis] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Kedge Business Sch, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Chenavaz, Regis] EHESS, F-13288 Marseille, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Aix-Marseille Universite; Kedge Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Kedge Business Sch, F-13288 Marseille, France.",regis.chenavaz@kedgebs.com,"; Chenavaz, Regis Y./T-1210-2017","Karoubi, Bruno/0000-0001-8866-3260; Chenavaz, Regis Y./0000-0002-5911-2045",,,,,32,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We offer a resolution of two longstanding open problems and show that (i) any MSE induces a RSED and any RSED can be lifted to a MSE, and (ii) a mixed strategy profile is aMSE if and only if it has the ex post Nash property. Our substantive results are a direct consequence of an exact law of large numbers that can be formalized in the analytic framework of a Fubini extension.

In particular, using data for four South Asian emerging stock markets over the period 1998-2012, the article examines the influence of a selection of local, regional and global economic variables in explaining equity returns; most previous studies that have examined this issue have tended to focus on only local and/or global factors. Important factors are identified by distilling the macroeconomic variables into principal components. Economic activities, real interest rates, real exchange rates and the trade balance represent local factors. Regional factors are represented by inter regional trade and regional economic activity while global factors are represented by world financial asset returns and world economic activity. The vector autoregression results suggest that the South Asian markets examined are not efficient. Both local and regional factors can directly and indirectly explain Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Sri Lankan stock returns while the lagged returns of the Pakistani stock market and world economic activity can explain Indian stock returns.","[Khan, M.

We estimate the capital share (a) from a Cobb-Douglas production function in an intensive form, by employing panel data techniques. The Hausman and Chi-Square tests indicate that a Cross-Section Random Effects with Period Fixed Effects model best suits our data. Based on this model, we find a capital share between 0.45 and 0.83, higher than the usual 0.3-0.4 used in growth accounting literature. When we take into consideration the quality of labour force the estimated capital share slightly decreases, but still remains high, in a range between 0.39 and 0.79. Our growth accounting results reveal that, on average, capital per worker accumulation is the main engine of growth in CEE, followed by the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP). However, when dividing by sub-periods, we found that the contribution of TFP cannot be neglected since during 1997-2004 it proved to be the main engine of growth in some CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania).

In general, the consequences of the global 2008 2009 crisis were more severe in some of the new EU countries, and it is useful therefore to look at the experiences in the different countries to try and understand the reasons for the different outcomes and look to see what lessons may be learned. One of the factors having an impact on recovery from the crisis is in currency relationships, with Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia being members of the Eurozone, and some other countries in fixed exchange rate relationships. In this paper we present the construction of a new indicator (named the TT index) evaluating macroeconomic vulnerability of the new EU countries, which is based on seven macroprudential indicators and calculated for the years 2008 and 2013.","[Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Tripe, David] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; Massey University,"Teply, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",teply@.fsv.cuni.cz; d.w.tripe@massey.ac.nz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,Czech Science Foundation [GA 14-02108S]; University of Economics in Prague [VSE IP100040],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); University of Economics in Prague,"Financial support from The Czech Science Foundation (project No. GA 14-02108S - The nexus between sovereign and bank crises), and University of Economics in Prague (project No. VSE IP100040) is gratefully acknowledged.",,39,8,8,0,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Such a model has become progressively dominant since the late 1970s when the neoliberal policy strategy started to become hegemonic. The new policy regime fostered the recent process of globalisation and financialisation, leading to a perverse interaction between the main dimensions of sustainability originating and reinforcing the Great Recession. The crisis, in its turn, worsened many crucial sustainability indicators, generating a vicious circle that might last for a long time. The need for a new sustainability-based economic paradigm is confirmed by the observed gap between the GDP growth indicators and the well-being of individuals and by the nature and requirements of the existing technological trajectory. The paper concludes that we urgently need a radical revision of the current development model towards a more sustainable direction to find a durable escape from the present crisis and start up a more satisfactory development trajectory.","[Vercelli, Alessandro] Univ Siena, DEPS, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Vercelli, Alessandro] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Siena; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Vercelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, DEPS, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",,,,,,,,75,5,5,0,1,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-44613-8; 978-1-137-44612-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,37,73,,,,,,37,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380488600002,0

In addition, the lagged value of the ratio of public expenditures on health care is added to the model.

I examine the gendered nature of this growth-employment nexus by analyzing the differential impacts that macroeconomic policies and structures have on growth's employment intensity by gender for eighty countries in the period from 1990 to 2012. Such an understanding is of particular relevance to policymakers concerned with the linkages between growth and human development, as the question of whether the benefits of economic growth are broadly shared is one that centers on the capacity of economies to generate high-quality employment. Although education levels and non-agricultural sectors are associated with more employment intensive growth for men and women, policies supporting reductions in non-wage care work, prioritizing public expenditures on education, and promoting secondary school enrollment for girls are especially linked with growth that is more employment intensive for women. The results I obtain here illuminate broad trends through a very wide lens and should be applied in conjunction with more intimate knowledge of how cultural, technological, legal, political, and economic activities uniquely affect one another in particular countries.","[Anderson, Bret] Southern Oregon Univ, Ashland, OR 97520 USA",,"Anderson, B (通讯作者)，Southern Oregon Univ, Ashland, OR 97520 USA.",,,,,,,,41,9,9,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Portfolios are constructed from constituent-level monthly price data using the Shariah screening criteria as proposed by MSCI, FTSE, Dow Jones, S&P and AAOIFI. The unique SCP construction approach used in this study removes any concerns of performance deviation due to the portfolio construction methodology, rebalancing timing, and management skills for security selection or market timing. Empirical results indicate that SCPs are generally less risky than CBPs. We also find that Shariah screening standards are insignificant in their effect on return performance. SCPs using the BVTA approach usually report a little better nominal and risk-adjusted returns than SCPs using the MVE approach for financial screening. The negligible difference in risk-adjusted performance and rebalancing based on different criteria indicate a need for greater consistency in applying Shariah screening standards.

Using China's data from 1995 to 2014, we employ propensity score matching and difference-in-differences approaches to investigate the effects of FSIs on the business models of Chinese banks, including income structure and funding structure. We find that FSIs significantly influence income structure. The bank's non-interest income (NII) share significantly rises after introducing FSIs. The higher ownership shares of FSIs are associated with the higher NII share. And the NII share has been increased when FSIs assign directors or senior managers to Chinese banks. We also report that the effects of FSIs on income structure are weaker in state-owned banks than those in other banks, and ownership concentration weakens the links between FSIs and income structure. Finally, this article shows that FSIs have no significant influence on funding structure. These findings will be informative and relevant to both policymakers and practitioners.","[Cheng, Maoyong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mingming] Univ Colorado, Coll Business, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Zhao, H (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China.",zhaored@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Mingming/0000-0002-8480-8503","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572532]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403202, 71502138, 71572144, 71103139]; Fundamental Research Funds from the Central Universities [sk2016004]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds from the Central Universities,"This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572532]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71403202], [grant number 71502138], [grant number 71572144], [grant number 71103139]; Fundamental Research Funds from the Central Universities [grant number sk2016004].",,73,1,2,5,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contrast to most previous literature, this paper focuses on the countries of the Middle East and North African region (MENA), and compares the performance of Islamic and conventional funds during crisis and recovery periods. Results show that the relative performance of Islamic and conventional funds seem to be conditioned by several factors such as the (geographical) context in which the investment is made. Considering the entire MENA region, Islamic funds perform, on average, slightly worse than conventional funds. However, if the analysis is restricted to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the result opposite is found.

Outcome-based people, on the other hand, adjust their behavior to the concrete consequences of their acts. We argue that the categorization of the mind-set may also be informative when it comes to explaining the effects that good and bad moral examples have on the moral behavior of the observer. To test this, we play a dictator game after dictators observed prosocial and antisocial third-party actions in a different domain. The consequences of these actions affected dictator and receiver identically. We hypothesized that this makes it unnecessary for an outcome-minded dictator to intervene correctively, while it influences a rule-minded dictator to follow the example by aligning her behavior. In line with our hypothesis, we find that only rule-minded dictators reacted to the example set by others. They are, however, asymmetrically incited by moral transgressions, while being left uninspired by praiseworthy examples. Our findings call for some precaution when applying policy measures based on informing people about prosocial and antisocial behavior, especially in cultures in which the moral focus is on rules.

The focus of this paper is on the transitional dynamics behavior, with an emphasis both, on the asymptotic as well as on the average speed of convergence. We calibrate the model for a typical OECD country. On the basis of dynamic welfare calculations, which consider transitional dynamics effects, we show that welfare differences are most pronounced for an economy, which values health relatively highly and where the environmental tax change is more than just marginal. Hence, if an economy moves towards a more sustainable society, the policy maker should take into consideration transitional dynamic effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The three structural adjustment programs that were implemented in Greece after 2010 increased the liberalization of Greek agriculture and the centralization of the food sector.

In this setting, qualification becomes a public good for firms when their profits are increasing in the stock of skilled workers but remains a private good to students/workers. Students have to pay a tuition fee but at the same time firms sponsor education: universities sell training to both. We prove that the proportion of skilled workers is larger in more competitive economies/industries while the share of firms in the financing of training is a monotonically decreasing function of the degree of competition. An increase of the latter indeed increases the equilibrium skilled wage while reducing its sensitivity to an increase of the supply of skilled workers. The firms' aggregate expenditures on training per worker are nevertheless a nonmonotonic function of the competitiveness of the economy.","[Lasram, H.] Univ Carthage, IHEC, Tunis, Tunisia; [Lasram, H.] Univ Carthage, Unite MASE ESSAI, Tunis, Tunisia; [Lasram, H.; Laussel, Didier G.] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Aix En Provence, France; [Lasram, H.; Laussel, Didier G.] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, EHESS, Aix En Provence, France",Universite de Carthage; Universite de Carthage; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lasram, H (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, IHEC, Tunis, Tunisia.;Lasram, H (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, Unite MASE ESSAI, Tunis, Tunisia.;Lasram, H (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Aix En Provence, France.;Lasram, H (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, EHESS, Aix En Provence, France.",hejer.lasram@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Advocates emphasize its importance for poverty reduction in underdeveloped economies. However, how reform comes about and evolves and what it is and does is situated, not universal, as neoclassical economists suggest. This paper sheds light on the meaning, evolution, and outcomes of land reform in Ghana. It draws on historical and contemporary socio-legal and political-economic sources of evidence, analyzed within a critical postcolonial institutional framework. It shows important features of continuity and change in both colonial and postcolonial land reform. While pre-colonial land tenure relations are misrepresented as entailing no market activities, the concerted effort to introduce capitalist markets into the land sector to produce socially efficient outcomes has led to contradictory results.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Property & Polit Econ & Urban Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Peter Johnson Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",franklin.obeng-odoom@uts.edu.au,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,120,39,43,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Moreover, we divided our sample period into pre-financial crisis, during financial and post financial crisis. Estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) which incorporates losses beyond VaR are used as market risk measures for both univariate and multivariate portfolios. Our key input is the share price by market capitalization of publicly traded banks of similar size in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. Univariate analysis finds no discernible differences between Islamic and conventional banks. However, dynamic correlations obtained via a multivariate setting shows Islamic banks to be less riskier for both sets of conventional banks; and especially so during the recent global financial crisis. The policy implications are: (i) that the inclusion of Islamic banks within asset portfolios may mitigate potential risk; (ii) that the Basel committee should consider the ES measure of risk for Islamic banks in preference to the current VaR methodology, which over-estimates the market risk of Islamic banks.

We concluded that costs from levying E-Tolls on industries are small in comparison to total transport costs, and the impact on economic aggregates and most industries are marginal: investments (-0.404%), gross domestic product (GDP) (-0.01) and consumer price inflation (-0.10%). This is true even when considering costs and benefits on industries as well as consumers. Industries that experienced the greatest decline in output were transport, construction and gold.

Using this framework, we then provide some policy suggestions for making RMB internationalization a sustainable process.","[Zhang, Liqing; Tao, Kunyu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, LQ; Tao, KY (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhlq@cufe.edu.cn; tina_taokunyu@163.com,,,Chinese Ministry of Education [14JZD016],"Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)","The paper is sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Education project China's Capital Account Liberalization: Sequences and Risks (approval number: 14JZD016).

We use the stochastic maximum principle to analyze the model. This method uses forward/backward stochastic differential equations, and works when the economy is notMarkovian, which can be the case with recursive utility. With existence granted, the wealth portfolio is characterized in equilibrium in terms of utility and aggregate consumption. The equilibrium real interest rate is derived, and the resulting model is shown to be consistent with reasonable values of the parameters of the utility function when calibrated to market data, under various assumptions.","[Aase, Knut K.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Aase, KK (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Oslo, Norway.",knut.aase@nhh.no,,,,,,,69,2,2,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Running a framed field experiment with 828 six- to eleven-year old primary school children in the city of Meran, we find that cooperation generally increases with age, but that the gap between cooperation among in-group members and cooperation towards children speaking another language is considerable and develops with age. This gap is due to both in-group favoritism and language group discrimination. While the former is persistent across all age groups and both language groups and accounts for most of the discrimination observed, the latter only emerges in later years of primary school among children belonging to the German language group.

We use a dynamic scoring technique to calculate long-run as well as transitional effects on fiscal revenue when a tax cut is financed by either a lump-sum tax or consumption tax. We show that the revenue loss from an income tax cut becomes substantially smaller when agents can use international financial markets compared to the case of the closed economy. Responses of tradable and nontradable sectors to the capital income tax cut display a stark contrast in both long-run equilibrium and transitional dynamics due to different factor intensities. Capital income tax cut in the tradable sector is the most efficient policy instrument in terms of minimizing fiscal revenue loss. These simulation results suggest that fiscal sustainability issue when implementing a tax cut could be overstated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating time variation and fat-tails into a suit of popular univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributed models can improve the forecast performance of key Australian macroeconomic variables: real GDP growth, CPI inflation and a short-term interest rate. The forecast period is from 1992Q1 to 2014Q4, thus replicating the central banks forecasting responsibilities since adopting inflation targeting. We show that time varying parameters and stochastic volatility with Student's-t error distribution are important modeling features of the data. More specifically, a vector autoregression with the proposed features provides the best interest and inflation forecasts over the entire sample. Remarkably, the full sample results show that a simple rolling window autoregressive model with Student's-t errors provides the most accurate GDP forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that, under plausible conditions, firms' temp-to-perm conversion rates go down when this gap increases. Temporary workers respond to lower conversion rates by exerting less effort, while firms react by providing less paid-for training. Both channels lead to a decline in TFP. We test these implications in a large panel of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1991 to 2005, looking at the effects of three labour market reforms which entailed substantial changes in the firing-costs gap. Our empirical findings provide some support for the above-mentioned mechanism.","[Dolado, Juan J.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Ortigueira, Salvador] Univ Miami, Sch Business Adm, Coral Gables, FL USA; [Stucchi, Rodolfo] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",European University Institute; University of Miami; Inter-American Development Bank,"Dolado, JJ (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy.",juan.dolado@eui.eu; sortigueira@bus.miami.edu; rstucchi@iadb.org,"Dolado, Juan J./AAF-9148-2019","DOLADO, JUAN JOSE/0000-0003-3790-2457",Banco de Espana (Research Excellence Grant),Banco de Espana (Research Excellence Grant),"We acknowledge helpful comments from Cesar Alonso-Borrego, Manuel Arellano, Manuel F.

Effective energy system management is desirable for avoiding occurrence of these problems in the following decades under the national policy of revitalizing these industrial bases. This task is challenged by system complexity, data unavailability, and inaccurate demand forecasting which can hardly be resolved in existing studies. For improving energy system management in Qiqihar City, a representative industrial base in Northeastern China, under these challenges, a large-scale and fine-resolution Bayesian interval robust energy system optimization (BIRESO) approach is developed in this study. In detail, the structure, characteristics, problems and complexities of the energy system in this city are identified and analyzed. Based on these efforts, a series of optimized energy system management schemes are generated through construction of a BIRESO model and development of a solution algorithm. The obtained solutions can be ensured to remain robust when input data changes through controlling the degree of solution conservatism in accordance with probabilistic bounds on constraint violation. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation method was employed for effectively achieving dynamic forecast of energy demands. The tradeoff among energy security, economic development and environmental conservation under multiple uncertainties is revealed, and the optimal balance among them is identified. A scenario analysis approach is used to quantify the effects of economic growth on energy system schemes based on several developed scenarios. Results show that the BIRESO approach is capable of providing scientific support for energy supply planning, renewable energy development, technological advancement, facility expansion, energy allocation, pollution control, economic impacts assessment, and other energy related activities in Qiqihar City.

Other important variables identified are firms' per worker levels of human and physical capital, size and age. Moreover, we find strong evidence for the role of trade as a transmission channel of the crisis, as it carries over from northern economies to Sub-Saharan Africa.

When public services are not of high quality due to mismanagement or corruption, the wealthy may switch to private alternatives. Their exit weakens the influence of citizen voice over politicians, since that leaves the poor as the only constituent with a stake in good governance. As the civic control over local governments weakens, government's concern for social welfare declines even further, leading to more corruption and more corrosion in the quality of public services. Our model shows that establishing institutions (such as local taxation) that spread the costs and benefits of governance across the whole society is crucial for the success of local governments.

It identifies various sources of financing and estimates their respective impacts on enterprise restructuring. Loans from local commercial banks are found to be more effective than any other form of financing at promoting restructuring. Their effect increases as the size of the firm decreases. There is some evidence that the effectiveness of equity financing in restructuring increases over time, suggesting that the equity mechanism takes root in transition economies only gradually. It is also found that restructuring contributes to firm performance, suggesting a linkage among financing sources, restructuring, and firm performance.","[Kim, Byung-Yeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Park, Jieun] Korea Int Trade Assoc, FTA & Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Jieun] Korea Int Trade Assoc, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, BY (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",kimby@snu.ac.kr,,,Institute for Research in Finance and Economics at Seoul National University,Institute for Research in Finance and Economics at Seoul National University,B.-Y.

I find that business cycles appear similar whether international asset markets are complete or not when driven by a combination of non-persistent monetary shocks and persistent productivity (TFP) shocks. In turn, international asset market incompleteness has sizeable effects if (persistent) investment-specific technology (IST) shocks are a main driver of business cycles. I also show that the model with incomplete international asset markets can approximate the RER volatility and persistence observed in the data, for instance, if IST shocks are near-unit-root. Hence, I conclude that the nature of shocks, the extent of financial integration across countries and the existing limitations on asset trading are central to understand the dynamics of the real exchange rate and the endogenous international transmission over the business cycles.","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Southern Methodist Univ, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Southern Methodist University,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.;Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",enrique.martinez-garcia@dal.frb.org,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,"I would like to thank Maria Teresa Martinez-Garcia, Jens Sondergaard, Nikos Paltalidis, two anonymous referees and participants at the 2nd International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics for helpful discussions and suggestions.

This liberalization of banking industry in Pakistan has raised concerns over the dominant banks' exercise of market power on account of increase in market concentration due to mergers and acquisitions, high profitability in banking sector and increasing interest rate spread. Present study therefore explicitly tests the market conduct of banks using quarterly panel data of 30 banks from 2004 to 2012 and employing Panzar-Rosse, Bresnahan-Lau, Hall-Roeger and Boone's approaches to study market power. Our findings suggest that Pakistan's banking industry is working in a competitive environment and we find little evidence for the exercise of market power by the dominant banks. Our results remain robust across all these approaches to measure market power. These findings indicate that the liberalization and deregulation of Pakistan's banking industry has been successful in improving the competitive conditions in the market.","[Mirza, Faisal Mehmood; Khatoon, Isma] Univ Gujrat, Dept Econ, Gujrat, Pakistan; [Bergland, Olvar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",University of Gujrat; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Bergland, O (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",olvar.bergland@nmbu.no,"Mirza, Faisal/JSL-0818-2023","Mirza, Faisal/0000-0002-5762-9358",,,,,28,6,6,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We incorporated seven U.S. business cycles. The foreign risk premium was found to be significantly strong for both growth and value stocks, and the S&P500 index, indicating that U.S. integration within global market is strong and persistent over the past 20years. We report distinct risk characteristics owing to global linkages, for the two style-based U.S. funds over different business cycles. The foreign risk premium for growth stocks is mostly positive and especially high during contractions; in contrast, the value stocks demand more premiums during expansions. The growth and value linkages with foreign countries also vary quite substantially over the business cycles. A possible sign of convergence is the decreasing difference between value and growth foreign risk premiums, post-2001, perhaps indicative of greater domestic and global market integration. Our results support a solid, continuing trend of U.S. integration within global markets, with an influential role of business cycles.","[Rana, Shailesh] Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Rana, Shailesh] Grenoble Ecole Management, Grenoble, France; [Phillips, G.

This paper assesses the effectiveness of some of the instruments employed, using a model of the banking sector and elasticities estimated from Chinese data. We find that direct interest rate changes are a poorer instrument of monetary control in China than changes in reserve requirement ratios and loan-to-deposit ratios. This finding is based on the ambiguous estimated response of deposit demand to such changes, and may help to explain why changes to administered interest rates have been used sparingly as an instrument of Chinese monetary policy. We also find that the ambiguous deposit demand response could pose challenges for the effectiveness of open market operations under interest rate liberalisation, while exchange rate liberalisation is likely to make monetary instruments more powerful.

However, this gives supervisors the power to direct employees toward tasks that mainly benefit the supervisor rather than the organization. We cast a principal-supervisor-agent model in a multitask setting, where the supervisor has an intrinsic preference toward specific tasks and may receive soft information on the agent's efforts. We show that subjective performance pay based on evaluation by a biased supervisor has the same distorting effect on the agent's effort allocation across tasks as incentive pay based on an incongruent performance measure. Combining incongruent performance measures with biased supervision can mitigate, but does not always eliminate this distortion. We apply our results to the choice between specialist and generalist middle managers, where a trade-off between monitoring ability and bias arises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Empirically, we implement the wavelet-squared coherence methodology to analyse the co-movement through time, frequency and power. Our results unveil that the co-movement between the three financial sectors' CDSs changes through time and investment horizons, stressing the importance of hedging portfolios in real time. Also, we uncover that the changes in co-movement to relatively higher frequencies coincide with the inception of the recent global financial crisis. This result is collaborated with the co-movement between each CDS index and other global risk factors, including crude oil prices, interest rates and equity market volatility. Finally, we compare the wavelet coherence results with those of the DCC-FIAPARCH model and find that the two different approaches provide quite similar conditional correlations over time. Our results are important for investors, debtors, creditors and other decision-makers which are interested in CDS spread co-movements at different frequencies or investment horizons.

A decision-making procedure, common to all the models, is to vote between adoption of the chairman's proposal and retention of the status-quo policy, with heterogeneous votes generated by private information of the models' monetary policy committee members. The members can additionally express reservations regarding the final committee decision. The three alternative models differ in the degree of informational influence between the chairman and the remaining members. We find that a super-majoritarian model, in which the chairman proposes a policy she knows would be accepted by a supermajority of the committee members, combined with allowance for reservations, closely replicates real-world decision-making patterns. The model predicts no rejections of chairman's proposals, low but non-trivial dissent, even during meetings where the chairman proposes no change in policy, and predictive power of the voting record of the whole committee regarding future monetary policy changes.","[Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Zapal, Jan] CSIC, IAE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Zapal, Jan] Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Zapal, Jan] CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Horváth, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",roman.horvath@gmail.com; j.zapal@cerge-ei.cz,"Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020; Zapal, Jan/D-3390-2013; Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746; Zapal, Jan/0000-0002-5167-3788;",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"We thank two anonymous referees, Marianna Blix-Grimaldi, Jakob de Haan, Michael Ehrmann, Petra Gerlach-Kristen, Etienne Farvaque, Jan Filacek, Tomas Holub, Jarek Hurnik, Jakub Mateju, Ronny Razin, Marek Rozkrut, Marek Rusnak, Andrey Sirchenko and seminar participants at the CESifo conference on central bank communication, the European Public Choice Society annual conference, the Czech Economic Society biennial conference, the Czech National Bank and the Eurasia Business and Economics Society conference for helpful discussions.

We first introduce a measure that maps the various elements that define a jobless recovery into a single number that we label the jobless recovery depth. We then construct a database of 389 state-level observations and study the cross-sectional variations that emerge. We find that jobless recoveries in the United States are not a nation-wide phenomena, but a local event confined within a cluster of states that expands slowly between 1975 and 2015. We find the state-level evidence to be consistent with theories that link jobless recoveries to unusually long expansionary periods, less dynamic labor markets, and the advent of the great moderation. The evidence is not consistent with theories that link them to decreases in union power, increases in income inequality, or increases in health care costs.","[Mendez, Fabio; Schwartz, Jeremy] Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Reber, Jared D.] Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Credit Bank 1, 8356 Waylon Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89178 USA",Loyola University Maryland; Loyola University Maryland,"Méndez, F (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",fmendez1@loyola.edu; jdreber@gmail.com; jsschwartz1@loyola.edu,,,,,,,26,3,4,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Smaller municipalities, in particular, tend to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous studies have shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, in Japan, municipalities cannot issue bonds freely by regulation. When such regulation controls debt accumulation by the merging municipality, the free-rider effect should be weak. This study examines the relationship between the regulation of local government borrowing and free-rider behavior of Japanese municipalities. The difference-in-difference regression results confirm the existence of a free-rider effect in this regard. Moreover, the debt expenditure ratio, the index of the regulation of local public bond issues, has the same effect that prevents local public debt from increasing for both merging and never-merged municipalities. This fact shows that a merging municipality with a free-rider incentive cannot increase local public debt to excess by using the regulation. Therefore, the average free-rider effect per capita is approximately 7 % of the average local public debt per capita for the end of the pre-treatment period. This result is considerably lower than the effects of the Swedish cases.","[Nakazawa, Katsuyoshi] Toyo Univ, Dept Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 5-28-20 Hakusan, Tokyo 1128606, Japan",Toyo University,"Nakazawa, K (通讯作者)，Toyo Univ, Dept Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 5-28-20 Hakusan, Tokyo 1128606, Japan.",nakazawa@toyo.jp,"Nakazawa, Katsuyoshi/N-4014-2015","Nakazawa, Katsuyoshi/0000-0002-3490-6834",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530378] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,17,17,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Using a within-subject design, we also investigate the importance of the bargaining power by comparing the subjects' behavior in the ultimatum and the no-veto-cost game, which differ in the possible cost of responders rejecting the proposers' offer. Our findings suggest that proposers are willing to reward responders for their contribution to the joint endowment in any of the two games. As for responders, their behavior is consistent with equity theory only in the no-veto-cost game (in which a rejection is costless for them) when the game is first played. When the no-veto-cost game is played after the ultimatum game, we observe that the responders' demands usually exceed their contribution to the endowment. Finally, this paper reports evidence that the ultimatum and the no-veto-cost game differ in terms of efficiency and rejection rates. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

A treaty is modelled as a dynamic game among governments that decide on participation in every period. The net benefit of treaty membership increases over time. Spillovers among members and non-members accelerate or delay treaty formation by transforming participation into a strategic complement or substitute, respectively. The predictions of the model inform the estimation of the structural parameters, based on a cross section of treaty ratification dates. With this approach, I estimate the sign and magnitude of strategic interaction in the ratification of the Montreal Protocol, in the formation of Europe's preferential trade agreements, and in the growth of Germany's network of bilateral investment treaties. Through a series of counterfactual experiments, I explore different mechanisms that give rise to strategic interaction in the formation of these treaties.","[Wagner, Ulrich J.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Wagner, UJ (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",,,"Wagner, Ulrich/0000-0002-4046-2803","ERP Fellowship from German National Academic Foundation; Fisher Dissertation Fellowship from Resources for the Future; Georg Walter Leitner Grant in International and Comparative Political Economy from Yale University; Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation [SEJ2007-62908]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-31358, RYC-2013-12492]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ERP Fellowship from German National Academic Foundation; Fisher Dissertation Fellowship from Resources for the Future; Georg Walter Leitner Grant in International and Comparative Political Economy from Yale University; Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article is based on the first two chapters of my Ph.D. dissertation.

Using our measure of geographic risk and an empirical model of branch-network choice, we identify preferences toward GRD separately from other factors possibly limiting network expansion. Counterfactuals show that risk negatively affected bank value but was counterbalanced by economies of density/scale, reallocation/merging costs, and local market power concerns.","[Aguirregabiria, Victor] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Aguirregabiria, Victor] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Clark, Robert] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wang, Hui] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Toronto; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Peking University,"Aguirregabiria, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.;Aguirregabiria, V (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",victor.aguirregabiria@utoronto.ca; robert.clark@hec.ca; jackie.wang@gsm.pku.edu.cn,"Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024; AGUIRREGABIRIA, VICTOR/A-1349-2008","AGUIRREGABIRIA, VICTOR/0000-0002-3305-8159; Clark, Robert/0000-0002-5197-8370",,,,,73,27,36,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

More selective exam schools may have higher peer quality and sometimes are equipped with more experienced teachers and better facilities. We find, however, that elite exam high schools, which are the most selective, have no effects on student test scores. We find that on average the system of exam schools improves student performance on the exam, which indicates that students benefit from attending more selective non-elite schools. The results on qualifying for college admission are consistent with our findings about test scores. Differences among schools in peer achievement, student/teacher ratio and the percentage of certificated and experienced teachers partially explain our findings; self-choices of track and exam participation do not explain test scores or college admission.

We refer to this as a growth-tax puzzle. To explain the puzzle, we construct a tractable endogenous growth model with endogenous investment specific technological change (ISTC). Public and private capital stock externalities are assumed to augment ISTC. A specialized labor input exerts a positive externality in final good production. Our primary interest is to highlight the role of such externalities in explaining the puzzle. We show that the competitive equilibrium growth rate can be decomposed into a labor factor and a capital factor. Changes in factor income taxes, by affecting these factors, can have opposing effects leading to constancy in growth. Our model builds on the existing endogenous growth literature by providing an alternative, but compatible explanation for the offsetting growth effects of fiscal policy on growth observed in the data.

For the United States and Europe, we highlight that this slow pace began prior to the Great Recession. The timing thus suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. For the United States, at the frontier of knowledge, there was a burst of innovation and reallocation related to the production and use of information technology in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s. That burst ran its course prior to the Great Recession. Continental European economies were falling back relative to that frontier at varying rates since the mid-1990s. We provide VAR and panel-data evidence that changes in real interest rates have influenced productivity dynamics in this period. In particular, the sharp decline in real interest rates that took place in Italy and Spain seem to have triggered unfavorable resource reallocations that were large enough to reduce the level of total factor productivity, consistent with recent theories and firm-level evidence.

Absent any selectivity bias, this access should increase the likelihood that migrants 'marry-up' in terms of education. We combine survey data on British and German immigrants in the US with data on natives in Britain and Germany to estimate the causal effect of migration on educational mobility through cross-national marriage. To control for selective mating, we instrument educational attainment using government spending on education in the years each person was of school-age. To control for selective migration, we instrument the migration decision using inflows of immigrants to the US during puberty and early adulthood. We find strong selectivity effects that work against the positive prospects of the US marriage market. All migrants give up spousal education in exchange for US entry and assimilation. Migrant men also give up spousal education because they cannot compete with native men as bread-earners. Migrant women have some advantage in the US marriage market, as they can compete with native women in home production.","[Christopoulou, Rebekka] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Lillard, Dean R.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lillard, Dean R.] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Lillard, Dean R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Macedonia; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Christopoulou, R (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece.",Christopoulou@uom.gr,"Lillard, Dean R/C-3244-2014","Christopoulou, Rebekka/0000-0002-7145-5497",Cornell Institute of the Social Sciences; Cornell Population Program,Cornell Institute of the Social Sciences; Cornell Population Program,"We gratefully acknowledge research assistance from Jeffrey Han and Duk Gyoo Kim and funding from the Cornell Institute of the Social Sciences and the Cornell Population Program (small Grant award, fall 2010).

In a laboratory experiment using exchange games, in which the trustor can choose the trustee, we study whether trustees can signal their trustworthiness by giving to charity. Our results show that donors are indeed perceived as more trustworthy and they are selected significantly more often as interaction partners. As a consequence of this sorting pattern, relative payoffs to donors and non-donors differ substantially with and without partner choice. However, we do not find donors to be significantly more trustworthy than non-donors. Our findings suggest that publicly observable generosity, such as investments in corporate social responsibility or donations to charity during a political campaign, can induce perceptions of trustworthiness and trust.

Assuming that governments are self-interested (rather than maximizing social welfare) we use a common agency framework to portray the calculus of political support-maximizing governments that find themselves in a situation of strategic interaction created by transboundary pollution. Our model shows how distortions created by the strategic interaction of national governments interact with distortions that arise due to the political processes in both countries. For instance, strong environmental lobbies may improve welfare as they counteract the distortion caused by the international externality, yet only up to a point. Instead of assuming interior solutions as most of the literature does, we show that corner solutions are a realistic possibility and derive conditions under which they occur. Moreover strong political distortions may create instability and thus lead to corner solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In sectors like pharmaceuticals, where monopoly distortions seem particularly severe, there is growing international political pressure to identify new reward mechanisms which complement the patent system and reduce prices. Innovation prizes and other non-patent rewards are becoming more prevalent in government's innovation policy, and are also widely implemented by private philanthropists. In this paper we describe situations in which a patent buyout is effective, using information from market outcomes as a guide to the payment amount. We allow for the fact that sales may be manipulable by the innovator in search of the buyout payment, and show that in a wide variety of cases the optimal policy still involves some form of patent buyout. The buyout uses two key pieces of information: market outcomes observed during the patent's life, and the competitive outcome after the patent is bought out. We show that such dynamic market information can be effective at determining both marginal and total willingness to pay of consumers in many important cases, and therefore can generate the right innovation incentives.

Although this theory is oriented towards long-run growth, it implicitly predicts the existence of cycles in any open economy. As we try to show, according to this theory, business cycles are generated by two factors: capital flows and trade shocks. Yet the standard model can overestimate cycles due to its specification of trade equations. In the paper we first develop the implications of the balance-of-payments constraint theory with regard to business cycles, then build an augmented model that can correct the potential over-estimation of cycles: Finally we use that model to analyze the sources of business cycles in Portugal and Spain and to show that the standard model does indeed overestimate cycles, at least in these two cases.

The majority of theoretical explanations for this observation have viewed the term premia through the lens of the consumption based capital asset pricing model. In contrast, we harken to an older empirical literature that attributes the term premium to the idea that short maturity bonds are inherently more liquid. The goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical justification of this concept. To that end, we employ a monetary-search model extended to include assets of different maturities. Short term assets mature in time to take advantage of random consumption opportunities. Long term assets cannot be used directly to purchase consumption, but agents may liquidate them in a secondary asset market characterized by search and bargaining frictions. Our model delivers three results that are consistent with empirical facts. First, long term assets have higher rates of return in steady state to compensate agents for their relative lack of liquidity. Second, since the difference in the yield of short and long term assets reflects asset market frictions, our model predicts a steeper yield curve for assets that trade in less liquid secondary markets. Third, our model predicts that freshly issued (on-the-run) assets will sell at higher prices than previously issued (off-the-run) assets that mature in nearby dates, because sellers of the latter have a more urgent need for liquidity.","[Geromichalos, Athanasios; Salyer, Kevin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Herrenbrueck, Lucas] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of California System; University of California Davis; Simon Fraser University,"Geromichalos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ageromich@ucdavis.edu; herrenbrueck@sfu.ca; kdsalyer@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,42,15,22,0,7,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

By applying this measure to German trade data at the eight-digit level, we study the quality change of Chinese export goods in its IIT with Germany. We compare the case of China with those of Eastern European countries, which are also major trading partners of Germany. Our results show that the unit value difference in IIT between Germany and Eastern European countries is clearly narrowing. However, China's export prices to Germany are much lower than Germany's export prices to China, and this gap has not narrowed over the last 23 years. This is at odds with the common perception that China's product quality has improved, as documented by Rodrik [Rodrik, D (2006). Whats so special about China's exports?

Our analysis is based on child psychometric measures from a longitudinal German dataset, which tracks mothers and their newborns up to age six. We identify major changes in parental health (shocks) and control for a variety of initial characteristics of the child including prenatal conditions. The results are robust to placebo regressions of health shocks that occur after the outcomes are measured. Our findings point to negative effects of maternal health shocks on children's emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity. We estimate that maternal health shocks worsen outcomes by as much as 0.9 standard deviations.

Why did Brexit make the United Kingdom, and indeed the world, fundamentally more unpredictable? I present two main reasons, one idiosyncratic to Brexit and one broadly applicable.

We consider a Cournot duopoly market with asymmetric pre-innovation costs and an independent patent holder who is not a producer in the market. There are two kinds of cost reducing innovations: common innovation and new technology innovation. We show that the best way to transfer an innovation for the patent holder is to sell the patent to the efficient firm at a fixed payment who would further license the innovation to its rival. This patent sale dominates all other methods of licensing for both kinds of innovations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Research has produced mixed results and has not compared how energy shocks differ from equal-sized shocks elsewhere in the economy. What emerges is that the estimated impacts of energy development vary by region, empirical methodology, as well as the time horizon that is considered. This paper captures these dimensions to present a more complete picture of energy boomtowns. Utilizing US county data, we estimate the effects of changes in oil and gas extraction employment on total employment growth as well as growth by sector. We compare this to the effects of equal-sized shocks in the rest of the economy to assess whether energy booms are inherently different. The analysis is performed separately for nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties using instrumental variables. We difference over 1-, 3-, 6-, and 10-year time periods to account for county fixed effects and to assess responses across different time horizons. The results show that in nonmetro counties, energy sector multiplier effects on total county employment first increase up to 6-year horizons and then decline for 10-year horizons. We also observe positive spillovers to the non-traded goods sector, while spillovers are small or negative for traded goods. In metro counties, there are no significant effects on total employment, although positive spillovers are present in some sectors. Yet, equal-sized shocks in the rest of the economy produce more jobs on average than oil and gas shocks, suggesting that policymakers should seek more diversified development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Measures typically used in empirical studies share several disadvantages: they are not available on a sectoral basis to reflect concerns of industry competitiveness; they are not available for a wide range of countries to allow for international comparisons; or they are not broad enough to reflect the multidimensionality of environmental policy. This paper develops a thorough, internationally comparable, sector-specific measure of multidimensional climate policy stringency where a shadow price approach serves as a basis. The approach is applied to climate policy by determining sector-specific emission-relevant energy costs on the basis of the sectors' usage of emission-relevant energy carriers and the carriers' respective prices. The resulting shadow price estimates are heterogeneous and can be applied in future research to test for carbon leakage and pollution havens.","[Althammer, Wilhelm; Hille, Erik] HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management,"Hille, E (通讯作者)，HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",Erik.Hille@hhl.de,,"Hille, Erik/0000-0002-2134-406X",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the project Climate Policy and the Growth Pattern of Nations; BMBF priority funding Economics of Climate Change,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the project Climate Policy and the Growth Pattern of Nations(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BMBF priority funding Economics of Climate Change(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Financial support by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the project Climate Policy and the Growth Pattern of Nations is gratefully acknowledged.

Overall, our model incorporating differentiated responses for appreciation versus depreciation reveals a more significant impact of the exchange rate on commodity trade between Korea and the U.S. than a more standard model that imposes symmetry.

An exogenously imposed minimum wage at the competitive outcome lowers average wage offers. Workers do not negatively reciprocate and continue to offer high effort. In the endogenous wage setting institution, where workers first make wage proposals, wage offers increase marginally and average effort decreases relative to the baseline when wage proposals are not matched. Relative to the baseline, efficiency decreases in the minimum wage treatment while it marginally increases in the endogenous treatment.

Most constitutions include incompatibility and ineligibility rules due to concerns about conflicts of interest and the politicization of the public service. We study how these rules affect the attractiveness of parliamentary mandates for public servants and thus the selection into politics. We compile a novel dataset that captures the fraction of public servants in 76 national legislatures as well as the respective (in)compatibility regimes. On average, there are seven percentage points fewer public servants in parliaments where a strict regime is in force. Supplementary evidence based on IV estimations shows that the fraction of public servants in parliament is positively correlated with government consumption, but not correlated with government effectiveness.

For each regulatory framework, we compute equilibrium outcomes when an incumbent firm and a new entrant compete A la Cournot in the final gas market. We find that the entrant's contracting conditions in the upstream market and the transmission tariff are key determinants of the market structure in the downstream gas market (both with ownership and with legal unbundling). We also study how the regulator must optimally set transmission tariffs in each of the two unbundling regimes. We conclude that welfare maximizing tariffs often require free access to the transmission network (in both regulatoy regimes). However, when the regulator aims at promoting the break-even of the regulated transmission system operator, the first-best tariff is unfeasible in both regimes. Hence, we study a more realistic set-up, in which the regulator's action is constrained by the break-even of the regulated firm (the transmission system operator). In this set-up, we find that, for a given transmission tariff, final prices in the downstream market are always higher with ownership unbundling than with legal unbundling.","[Brandao, Antonio; Pinho, Joana; Resende, Joana; Sarmento, Paula; Soares, Isabel] Univ Porto, CEF, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Resende, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF, Oporto, Portugal.",abrandao@fep.up.pt; jpinho@fep.up.pt; jresende@fep.up.pt; sarmento@fep.up.pt; isoares@fep.up.pt,"Pinho, Joana/M-4008-2013; Sarmento, Paula/B-6113-2009","Pinho, Joana/0000-0001-6348-3108; Resende, Joana/0000-0002-8322-2578; Soares, Isabel/0000-0002-2707-7089; Sarmento, Paula/0000-0002-4199-6030","University of Porto; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; FEDER [SFRH/BPD/79535/2011]; CEF.UP University of Porto; FCT; FEDER, through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE); National Funds, through Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, through projects PTDC/IIM-ECO; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/79535/2011] Funding Source: FCT","University of Porto; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); CEF.UP University of Porto; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER, through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE); National Funds, through Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, through projects PTDC/IIM-ECO; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","Joana Pinho acknowledges financial support from University of Porto, Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia and FEDER (SFRH/BPD/79535/2011).

Are high-ability individuals more likely to quit egalitarian organisational regimes? The article revisits this long-standing issue by analysing the interplay between compensation structure and quit behaviour in the distinct yet underexplored institutional setting of worker-managed firms. The analysis is based on novel administrative data sources, which allow constructing a simple ordinal measure of the workers' ability type. The article's key findings are that worker-managed firms have a more compressed compensation structure than conventional firms, and high-ability members are more likely than other members to exit.","[Burdin, Gabriel] Univ Republica, IECON, FCEA, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Burdin, Gabriel] IZA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Burdin, Gabriel] Univ Siena, DEPS, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University of Siena","Burdín, G (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay.",gburdin@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,,,,,,,46,20,23,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The evidence is most consistent with the law of small numbers and the gambler's fallacy-people underestimating the likelihood of sequential streaks occurring by chance-leading to negatively autocorrelated decisions that result in errors. The negative autocorrelation is stronger among more moderate and less experienced decision makers, following longer streaks of decisions in one direction, when the current and previous cases share similar characteristics or occur close in time, and when decision makers face weaker incentives for accuracy. Other explanations for negatively autocorrelated decisions such as quotas, learning, or preferences to treat all parties fairly are less consistent with the evidence, though we cannot completely rule out sequential contrast effects as an alternative explanation.","[Chen, Daniel L.] Toulouse Sch Econ, Inst Adv Study, Toulouse, France; Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; AQR Capital Management, Greenwich, CT USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chen, DL (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Inst Adv Study, Toulouse, France.",kelly.shue@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,33,100,118,2,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The model is investigated empirically using data from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). We show that the implication of the uncertainty element is to cause the authority to change its indirect control, output by less (and hence change it direct control, interest rate by less) whenever inflation is below or above the target, in line with Brainard's attenuation principle. We also find that SARB's asymmetric output stabilization explains inflation movements significantly, and that the monetary authority seems to be more averse to business cycle recessions than expansions, hence more keen to avoid recessions than expansions. Overall, a more transparent and committed monetary policy practice that would reduce uncertainty over the output-inflation trade-off would be helpful for economic stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the sequential organization of the market, a model in which realized volatility depends on its own past and that of the other sessions is specified and then modified in two ways. On the one hand, total variation is decomposed into jump and non jump components and on the other hand EGARCH innovations are considered. Estimation results show significant volatility transmissions between the sessions. Out-of-sample forecast criteria select EGARCH innovations for sessions 1 and 2, while simpler models with no EGARCH innovations and no jump distinction are preferred for sessions 5 and 6.

Using monthly survey forecasts for France, Italy and the United Kingdom between January 1993 and October 2014, we test whether respondents consider the expected evolution of the fiscal balance-and other economic fundamentals to be significant drivers of the expected bond yield differential over a benchmark German 10 year bond. Our main result is that a projected improvement of the fiscal outlook significantly reduces expected sovereign spreads. This suggests that credible fiscal plans affect market experts' expectations and reduce the pressure on sovereign bond markets. In addition, we show that expected fundamentals generally play a more important role in explaining forecasted spreads compared to realized spreads.

We find evidence of important asymmetries: the output response to a tax increase is statistically insignificant, but output shows a significantly positive and permanent increase following a tax decrease. We show that this asymmetry appears to be driven by individual-income tax changes, and is transmitted to the economy through asymmetric response in aggregate consumption to tax increases and tax decreases. We also present a simple model that rationalizes our empirical findings, and illustrates how asymmetric output and consumption responses to sign-based tax changes can be generated by plausible consumption-adjustment costs.

The implications of our model are dramatically different from those obtained in the prior literature.

The controversy may be attributed to the various definitions and methodologies for testing convergence. This study analyzes regional income inequality and convergence in China from the perspective of club convergence proposed by Phillips and Sul (2007). Instead of one convergence at the national level, we determine that provincial incomes are converging into two clubs: seven east-coastalprovinces (Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, and Fujian) and Inner Mongolia are converging into a high income club, and the remaining provinces are converging into a low income club. In addition, we obtain strong evidence that income inequality within a club decreases, while that between clubs deteriorates over time. Between-club inequality is associated with investment in physical and human capital, as well as population growth rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring risk preferences reliably is therefore an important challenge. In this paper we ask the question whether risk preferences observed in economic experiments reflect real-life risky choice behaviour. We investigate in a sample representative for a rural region of eastern Uganda whether pursuing farming strategies with both a higher expected profit and greater variance of profits is associated with willingness to take risks in an experiment. Controlling for other determinants of risk-taking in agriculture, we find that risky choice behaviour in the experiment is correlated with risky choice behaviour in real life in one domain, i.e. the purchase of fertiliser, but not in other domains, i.e. the growing of cash crops and market orientation more broadly. Our findings suggest that economic experiments may be good at capturing real-world risky choice behaviour that is narrowly bracketed. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Entrepreneurs lie at the center of the model and face disincentive effects from taxation but acquire positive benefits from public infrastructure. Political corruption governs the efficiency with which tax revenues are translated into infrastructure. The model predicts an inverted-U relationship between taxation and growth, with corruption reducing the optimal taxation level. We find evidence consistent with these predictions and the entrepreneurial channel using data from the Longitudinal Business Database of the US Census Bureau. The marginal effect of taxation for growth for a state at the 10th or 25th percentile of corruption is significantly positive; on the other hand, the marginal effects of taxation for growth for a state at the 90th percentile of corruption are much lower across the board. We make progress towards causality through Granger-style tests and by considering periphery counties where effective tax policy is largely driven by bordering states. Finally, we calibrate our model and find that the calibrated taxation rate of 37% is fairly close to the model's estimated welfare maximizing taxation rate of 42%. Reducing corruption provides the largest potential impact for welfare gain through its impact on the uses of tax revenues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This 'solvency rule' is examined here within a stylised model of a monetary union characterised by different rates of accumulation and inflation across its two member countries. The rule highlights the existence of a relationship between the interest rate set by the central monetary authority and the allocation of ownership of existing physical capital among the member countries of the monetary union, i.e. the 'rates of capital centralisation'. The paper also shows the nexus between solvency and government debt sustainability, and examines the implications of deflationary or currency devaluation policies for the solvency conditions.","[Brancaccio, Emiliano; Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sannio; University of Leeds,"Fontana, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Econ, LUBS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",gf@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,"BRANCACCIO, Emiliano/0000-0001-7765-3892",,,,,62,13,13,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We investigate in particular the effect of two policies introduced during that time: the energy label requirement, which went into effect in the end of 2005, and a feebate based on CO2 emissions of new vehicles in 2008. We estimate a flexible model of demand for automobiles that incorporates consumers' heterogeneity and valuation of vehicle CO2 emissions. Our results show that there has been a shift in preferences towards low-emitting cars. Moreover, the timing of these changes is consistent with the introduction of the two policies. This suggests that the feebate had a crowding-in effect in addition to its price effect.

The main objective is to attain a better understanding of economic processes by focusing on inter-industrial structures as a main explanatory factor of the observed international disparities in development. This study shows the existence of a fundamental inter-industrial structure, common to all countries. When comparing groups of countries, there are also structural differences that are in accordance with differences in development levels, in industrial specialization and in the structural position of some industrial sectors. Those differences have an impact on the countries' unequal development processes. This study shows that both methodologies, input-output and network analyses, are complementary and allow to attain more advanced explanations of the processes of development. By applying network theory it is possible to improve our knowledge on structural differences and its relation with economic growth and development.","[Noguera-Mendez, Pedro; Sernitiel-Garcia, Maria; Lopez-Martinez, Maria] Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Noguera-Méndez, P (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",pedrono@um.es; mariase@um.es; marlomar@um.es,"Méndez, Pedro Noguera/AAA-8922-2019; López-Martínez, María/AAA-2051-2019; García, María Semitiel/AAA-8792-2019","Méndez, Pedro Noguera/0000-0003-2637-9920; López-Martínez, María/0000-0002-6363-2852; García, María Semitiel/0000-0002-7571-6666",,,,,39,2,3,1,23,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Integration is implemented by reassigning a small number of high-skilled workers, especially in R&D and management. Workforce mixing is concentrated to establishments set up after merger, rather than to previously existing establishments. Worker turnover is high after merger, but new hiring yields stable total employment. Target employees have higher turnover and reassignment, particularly if the target firm is small relative to the acquiring firm. These findings might suggest that integration is costly, but can be achieved by focusing on key employees. Alternatively, the reassignment of a few key employees is sufficient for achieving integration.","[Smeets, Valerie] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark; [Ierulli, Kathryn] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gibbs, Michael] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Aarhus University; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Smeets, V (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, DK-8210 Aarhus, Denmark.",vas@asb.dk; kierulli@uchicago.edu; michael.gibbs@chicagobooth.edu,,,European Commission [MEIF-2003-501280]; Aarhus School of Business; Stigler Center; Moensted Foundation,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Aarhus School of Business; Stigler Center; Moensted Foundation,"Funding was provided by the European Commission (MEIF-2003-501280), Aarhus School of Business, Stigler Center, and Moensted Foundation.

This paper continues this line of inquiry by developing a broad nonlinear Taylor rule framework, in conjunction with real-time data, to examine the Fed's policy response during the Great Moderation, an era in which the U.S. economy experienced low output volatility and mild inflation. Our analysis finds that standard two-regime smooth transition models are unable to fully capture the Fed's nonlinear response. Thus we utilize the Multiple Regime Smooth Transition model (MRSTAR) to get a better understanding of the Fed's asymmetric preferences and opportunistic conduct of monetary policy. With the MRSTAR model we can use both inflation and the output gap as concurrent threshold variables in the Fed's policy response function and are able to determine that policy makers prioritize loss of output over inflationary concerns. Our flexible nonlinear framework is also able to convincingly show that the Fed departed from the Taylor rule during key periods in the Great Moderation as well as in the recent financial crisis.

Accounting for potential non-linearities in the Phillips Curve, we show that trade openness is not rejected as a threshold variable for the effects of domestic and foreign slack on inflation in many advanced economies, and we find a switch of the output gap slopes from one regime to the other that is consistent with the key predictions of the inflation globalization hypothesis. For some countries the threshold Phillips Curve model also leads to improvements in out-of-sample forecast over the linear Phillips models, especially at longer horizons. Contrary to most of the previous literature which ignores such non-linearities, our new approach provides some interesting empirical evidence supportive of the effect globalization has on a country's inflation dynamics.

We lift such restrictions to study equilibrium when search can be directed over time, without constraints and at no cost. In equilibrium, trade frictions arise endogenously, and price commitments, if they do exist, are self-enforcing. In contrast to the typical model, there exists a continuum of equilibria that exhibit trade frictions. These equilibria support any price above the static price, including monopoly pricing in arbitrarily large markets.

While the constructions offered in Ivanov (2014, 2015) significantly increase the amount of information transmitted in equilibrium, they rely on very demanding assumptions regarding the receiver's ability to alter the sender's information during the interim stages of communication. This note offers a new construction and shows that, for the uniform quadratic specification with constant sender's bias, if the sender's bias is sufficiently small, there exists a fully revealing equilibrium that does not require interim information control. Only the first-period signal is controlled ex ante, prior to any communication. The sender becomes completely informed at the end of period 2 regardless of his reporting strategy.

Based on a representative sample of Spanish employees from the Spanish Quality of Work Life Survey, we use an estimation procedure that controls for potential endogeneity, and find that greater job satisfaction of women is associated with women being happier working in occupations where they are the majority. However, when considering additional objective and self-perceived variables, gender differences in job satisfaction disappear and occupational variables turn non-significant. This result suggests that women tend to congregate in jobs with particular characteristics that are preferred by them, and negates the correlation between job satisfaction and gender distribution across occupations.","[Garcia-Mainar, Inmaculada; Garcia-Martin, Guillermo; Montuenga, Victor M.] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"García-Mainar, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,"García-Mainar, Inmaculada/L-3059-2014; Montuenga Gomez, Victor Manuel/F-4001-2016","García-Mainar, Inmaculada/0000-0003-2503-2829; Montuenga Gomez, Victor Manuel/0000-0003-2893-4051","Spanish Women's Institute [261168-190]; Autonomous Government of Aragon, Spain (Consolidated Research Group) [S13]","Spanish Women's Institute; Autonomous Government of Aragon, Spain (Consolidated Research Group)","The authors would like to thank participants at the I International Conference on Sociology of Public and Social Policies, the XVI Applied Economics Meeting, and the XXXVIII Spanish Economic Association Meeting for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

The new model type contributes to the trade network literature by enabling the description of complex dynamic processes, such as the propagation, overlap and cancellation of shocks and business cycles. This opens many possibilities for future policy applications with disaggregated model regions and sectors. The paper furthermore contributes to trade theory by deriving a straightforward rule for the optimal tariff respectively trade barrier. Calibrating the model to the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), the optimal trans-Pacific trade barrier between North America and Asia is estimated to be one third of the current trade barrier. The analysis identifies strong repercussions on global trade caused by increased trans-Pacific trade. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a Harberger-type model with general forms of preferences and substitution between capital, labor, and pollution in production that captures the impact of household heterogeneity and interactions with production characteristics on the general equilibrium. We theoretically show that failing to incorporate household heterogeneity can qualitatively affect incidence. We quantitatively illustrate that this aggregation bias can be important for assessing the incidence of a carbon tax, mainly by affecting the returns to factors of production. Our findings are robust to a number of extensions including alternative revenue recycling schemes, pre-existing taxes, non-separable utility in pollution, labor leisure choice, and multiple commodities.

This paper sets out to understand the structure of corruption through an econometric analysis of this survey. It finds that firms with higher 'ability to pay' (proxied by sales revenue and employee growth) are more likely to pay bribes. While firms with lower 'refusal power' (i.e. those dependent on bureaucratic permissions to export and import) are more likely to find corruption to be an obstacle. A distinct but related question is whether bribes act as 'efficiency grease' by allowing firms to circumvent red tape. No evidence is found to support this hypothesis; in fact, firms that pay bribes report greater bureaucratic hassle compared to firms that do not. This result fits in more closely with the view that red tape could be used to extract bribes from firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our theoretical model suggests that the offshoring of productive activities involving offshorable occupations raises the wage rate for non-offshorable occupations in the Home Country, and thus reduces the incentive for firms to provide training in non-offshorable occupations. The effects of offshoring on training for offshorable occupations, however, are ambiguous. Based on two new measures of offshoring and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (1989-2004), we empirically investigate the relationship between offshoring and employer-provided training in the United States. For non-offshorable occupations, we find that offshoring has a significant negative relationship with the incidence of training, but does not have much, if any, significant relationship with the intensity of training. For offshorable occupations, offshoring does not have any significant relationship with either the incidence or the intensity of employer-provided training. These findings are in line with our theoretical model.","[Barbu, Emilia; Song, Xueda] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Song, XD (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",xsong@yorku.ca,,,,,,,31,0,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The main findings of the study can be put into two categories. The first category covers energy consumption, openness rate, gross domestic product, exchange rate and investments, which are the most important determinants of the current deficit. The second one asserts that sustainability is weak for Turkish economy; however, it is even weaker during the economic contraction. There is extensive literature about structure and sustainability of the current account deficit. However, many of the studies have analysed the sustainability of the current account deficits without considering the economic conjuncture. For this purpose, the study employs the Markov-switching method which is a non-linear time series model.","[Topalli, Nurgun; Dogan, Ibrahim] Bozok Univ, Dept Econ, Yozgat, Turkey",Bozok University,"Topalli, N (通讯作者)，Bozok Univ, Dept Econ, Yozgat, Turkey.",nurgun.topalli@bozok.edu.tr,"Doğan, İbrahim/AAH-1806-2021",,,,,,91,12,12,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This article addresses three main questions: (i) what are the unintended consequences of economic activity on the spread of infections; (ii) how efficient are measures that limit interpersonal contacts; (iii) how do we allocate our scarce resources to limit the spread of infections? To answer these questions, we use novel high frequency data from France on the incidence of a number of viral diseases across space, for different age groups, over a quarter of a century. We use quasi-experimental variation to evaluate the importance of policies reducing interpersonal contacts such as school closures or the closure of public transportation networks. While these policies significantly reduce disease prevalence, we find that they are not cost-effective. We find that expansions of transportation networks have significant health costs in increasing the spread of viruses, and that propagation rates are pro-cyclically sensitive to economic conditions and increase with inter-regional trade.","[Adda, Jerome] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Adda, Jerome] IGIER, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Adda, J (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.;Adda, J (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, Italy.",,,"Adda, Jerome/0000-0002-7035-1565",,,,,57,206,217,9,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The analysis detects breaks in the coefficients of the oil production and price equations, together with volatility shifts in all three equations of the model. Coefficient changes imply an enhanced response of production to aggregate demand shocks after 1980; and that the price response to supply shocks is more persistent from the mid-1990s. All variables evidence changes in the relative contributions of individual shocks to their forecast error variances, with coefficient and volatility breaks in the first half of the 1990s being particularly important in this respect. The results show that analysts of this market should eschew constant parameter models estimated over an extended period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and GCAM and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant CO2 reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving CO2 emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in GDP and consumption. An assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper.

This holds true after controlling for workers' previous labour market status and for changes in the composition of who gets hired over the business cycle. Our evidence suggests that a large part of this reallocation reflect excess churning in the labour market. We also find that the majority of career changes come with wage increases. During the economic expansion wage increases were typically larger for those who change careers than, for those who do not. During the recession this is not true for career changers who were hired from unemployment. Our evidence suggests that understanding career changes over the business cycle is important for explaining labour market flows and the cyclicality of wage growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is often obtained as the mean and variance of a parameter's quasi-posterior distribution, which is defined using a classical estimation objective. We demonstrate that the objective must be properly scaled; otherwise, arbitrarily small confidence intervals can be obtained if calculated directly from the quasi-posterior distribution. We estimate a standard DSGE model and find that scaling up the objective may be useful in estimation with problematic parameter identification.

The model identifies four major episodes with respect to the confidence stance during the 1997-2014 period: the two low-confidence episodes are related, respectively, to the Asian crisis (late 1990s) and the Great Recession (2009-2013 observations), while the two high-confidence episodes consist of the economic boom of 2000-2008 and the current restored sentiment stage. Output and prices react differently to monetary policy and to exchange-rate shocks during the two regimes. A counterfactual experiment proves that the heterogeneities are driven by changes to the overall macroeconomic transmission framework, as well as to the central bank's reaction function. An alternative specification with industry confidence rather than aggregate economy confidence suggests that, following the recent crisis, firms' sentiment recovered much faster than that of consumers and the services sector.","[Nalban, Valeriu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest 010352, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nalban, V (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Finance Doctoral Sch, Tache Ionescu St 11, Bucharest 010352, Romania.",valeriu.nalban@fin.ase.ro,,,,,,,24,1,1,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Our regressions suggest that the dynamic interaction of these two variables is rather complicated. Estimating the long-run point, we argue that this equilibrium has been shifting as a matter of public policy. We hypothesize that a race-to-the-bottom arises from a need to be competitive in globalized markets. We report evidence that globalization does have a negative long-run effect on the wage share. We also find that other factors may have been important: unionization appears to be pro-wage share, while contractionary monetary policy, financialization, and a lower relative price of investment goods tend to be anti-wage share.","[Rada, Codrina; Kiefer, David] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Rada, C; Kiefer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",rada@economics.utah.edu; kiefer@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,28,14,16,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2016,67,2,,,SI,,477,498,,10.1111/meca.12081,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK7ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375145700011,0

We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1% wealth share has risen from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy's labor income. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.","[Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Saez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Laura and John Arnold Foundation; MacArthur foundation; Sandler foundation,Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Laura and John Arnold Foundation; MacArthur foundation; Sandler foundation,"We thank the editors Lawrence Katz and Andrei Shleifer, five anonymous referees, Tony Atkinson, Mariacristina DeNardi, Matthieu Gomez, Barry W.

A system of two panel data models is estimated to identify the growth determinants and their connection with foreign direct investment. We find that economic growth is driven most strongly by physical and human capital accumulation, as well as by sectorial exports, and that institutions and policy have a substantial impact on economic growth and investment. Macroeconomic disturbances have a significant detrimental effect on long-run growth. Trade openness correlates positively with foreign investment, indicating that relatively closed countries stand to benefit most from opening up their economies.

Specifically, we seek to determine whether off-farm labor increased after 2000, what forms of employment are driving trends in off-farm labor and whether gender differences can be observed in off-farm employment trends. Using a nationally representative dataset that consist of two waves of surveys conducted in 2000 and 2008 in six provinces, this paper finds that off-farm labor market participation continued to rise steadily in the early 2000s.

In addition, we find that rural off-farm employment trends are different for men and women. Our analysis also shows that the rise of wage-earning employment corresponds with an increasing unskilled wage for both men and women.","[Wang, Xiaobing; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Han, Linghui] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Finance, Res Inst Fiscal Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Han, Linghui] Tsinghua Univ, Natl Inst Fiscal Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Peking University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xbwang.ccap@pku.edu.cn; hanlinghui@hotmail.com; jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; rozelle@stanford.edu,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373255, 71333013]; Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources; Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012RC102, 2012ZD208, KSZD-EW-Z-021-1, Y02015004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71373255 and 71333013), the Institute for Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2012RC102; 2012ZD208;KSZD-EW-Z-021-1; Y02015004).",,30,16,18,6,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2016,24,3,,,SI,,18,36,,10.1111/cwe.12156,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957200003,0

We identify two structural changes in aggregate saving rates around 1978 and 2001, and examine them through a decomposition analysis of the income distribution and sector-specific saving rates. The following key findings are obtained. First, the major trends and compositions of Chinese saving rates changed markedly over the period considered, which explains the changes of aggregate saving rates with the dramatic economic transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy. Second, we investigate the surge in aggregate saving rates from 2001 to 2012 based on a series of institutional factors, such as the evolving labour market, domestic economic policy adjustments and changes in external economic conditions caused by China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and the 2008 global financial crisis. Finally, we present the future prospects for the high aggregate saving rates in China based on several evolving economic, demographic and policy trends. We argue that Chinese saving rates have peaked in recent years and that a declining trend is expected, which will contribute to the economic rebalancing of the country.","[Zhou, Shaojie] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jszhang@cuhk.edu.hk,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273006]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program,"Address for Correspondence: Department of Economics, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.

Using Papua New Guinea as a case study, this paper uses a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to analyse some options for a resource-dependent developing country to boost growth in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Four policy experiments were conducted to examine the impacts of increased primary factor productivity growth in the agricultural and manufacturing industries; increased investment in agriculture; increased investment in agriculture in conjunction with improved infrastructure; and improved value adding and productivity in agro-processing. Our results indicate that investing in agriculture and manufacturing without addressing supply side constraints such as poor road infrastructure would fail to maximise the desired impacts. We also show that by shifting the emphasis from production of primary commodities for export to value adding or secondary production activities, resource-dependent developing countries could enhance growth and employment.","[Sanida, Osborne] Natl Res Inst, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Asafu-Adjaye, John; Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Asafu-Adjaye, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",j.asafuadjaye@uq.edu.au,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,23,2,2,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We show that competition in the product market does not necessarily prevent the emergence of commercial media bias. Whether or not competing advertisers end up having negative consequences on news accuracy ultimately depends on the extent of correlation in the quality of their products; the lower the correlation, the higher the expected accuracy of the media outlet's reports. These findings provide a rationale to explain the observed differences in the extent of commercial media bias across seemingly similar industries or products, within the same media market. The results are robust to the presence of multiple media outlets and to asymmetries between the advertisers. Overall, the paper provides theoretical insights for media regulators and for the empirical literature examining the link between advertising and news contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In an intergenerational context policy reforms usually have redistributive, efficiency, and general equilibrium implications. Our analysis shows that when the policy reform implies changes in economic efficiency, generational accounts can be misleading not only about the magnitude of welfare changes, but also about the identity of who wins and who losses. In contrast, the generational accounts correctly identify welfare changes when the policy reform has only a pure intergenerational redistribution component. We illustrate and quantify this issue in the context of widely considered policy reforms (substitution of consumption for labor taxation, and the increase of retirement age) and in a more general context of optimal policy.

We start by highlighting the main differences between banks and nonfinancial firms and focus on three characteristics that make banks special: (i) regulation, (ii) the capital structure of banks, and (iii) the complexity and opacity of their business and structure. Next, we discuss the characteristics of corporate governance in banks and how they differ from the governance of nonfinancial firms. We then review the evidence on three governance mechanisms: (i) boards, (ii) ownership structures, and (iii) executive compensation. Our review suggests that some of the empirical regularities found in the literature on corporate governance of nonfinancial institutions, such as the positive (negative) association between board independence (size) and performance, do not hold for banks. Also, existing work provides no conclusive results regarding the relationship between different governance mechanisms and various measures for banks' performance.

This paper shows that nonlinear fiscal regimes alter equilibria under active and passive monetary-fiscal policies. The Fisher equation combined with nonlinear fiscal policies leads to multiple steady states. Under passive interest rate rules, even if the steady state in which fiscal policy is active is locally saddlepath stable, there exist infinite equilibrium paths originating in the neighborhood of that steady state that converge into a high-debt trap. Under active interest rate rules, even if the steady state at which fiscal policy is active is locally unstable, there exists a saddle connection with the high-debt equilibrium along which inflation is uniquely determined.","[Piergallini, Alessandro] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Piergallini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ Law & Inst, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.piergallini@uniroma2.it,,,"MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca)","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","I am grateful to two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Participants perform a task alone or in the presence of a peer. The feedback on the co-worker's output is manipulated and we vary whether the two workers can communicate. We find that when communication is allowed, the average productivity per unit of time and the quitting time are not increased but the presence of a peer causes workers to stay longer and to quit at more similar times. Peer effects on the extensive margin of effort derive more from a sociability effect, i.e. a reduction of the social distance between co-workers that could make the other's presence more valuable, than from performance or quitting time comparisons.

We differ from most existing studies by testing some new determinants motivated by recent theoretical advances in the literature. We find that a one percentage increase in public pension payments per elderly person leads to approximately a one third percentage increase in aggregate health spending, and this effect is significant and robust across a variety of model specifications. A back of the envelope calculation based on this estimate suggests that the expansion of the public pension programme on average accounts for approximately over one fifth of the rise in aggregate health expenditure as a share of GDP in the set of OECD countries during 1980-2005. In addition, we find that the estimated effect of GDP per capita in our model ranges from 0.66 to 0.80, which is consistent with the results from some recent studies, and thus further reinforces the finding in the literature that health care is not a luxury good.","[An, Yonghong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhao, Kai; Zhou, Rong] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Connecticut,"An, YH (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",y.an@tamu.edu,,,,,,,26,7,8,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, we extend the design in two directions. First, we collect information on investors' choices by using both the direct-response (as does Cox) and strategy methods. Using the latter, we are able to condition reciprocity on initial inequality, which is endogenous when investigating reciprocity. We demonstrate that the triadic design provides evidence for reciprocity once that initial inequality is considered. Second, we elicit expectations and test their coherence with the triadic outcomes. By examining the relationship between trust actions and expected gains, we analyze whether investors' expectations are consistent with their behavior. Finally, we test for the existence of an emotional bias, i.e., whether expectation mismatches induce trustees to change actual choices from the planned ones.","[Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Law, Via del Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Papa, Stefano] Univ Teramo, Dept Commun, Teramo, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Teramo,"Di Bartolomeo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Law, Via del Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.dibartolomeo@uniroma1.it; spapa@unite.it,"Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/K-3030-2015","Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/0000-0001-5016-8483",MIUR,"MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The authors are grateful to the Journal Editors J.K.

It reviews controversies in areas such as discounting, analytic perspective, identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold, differential treatment of particular disease areas or treatment groups, and the valuation of outcomes. It then considers in more detail the development of the World Health Organization's generalized cost-effectiveness framework, and the emergence of an international 'reference case' commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a way of increasing the generalizability and comparability of such studies.

Estimation exploits plausibly exogenous variation in the cost of a household electric connection. The time-varying distance between a municipality and the nearest hydroelectric dam is assumed not to directly affect socioeconomic outcomes but to influence electrification rates during 1973-2005. Changes within municipalities in dam distance are used to predict changes in electrification rates in specifications including both department fixed effects with extensive municipal controls and municipal fixed effects. Household electrification is found to have reduced fertility and to have increased young children's schooling but not to have had measurable self- or waged-employment effects.","[Grogan, Louise] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Grogan, Louise] Univ Cent Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan",University of Guelph; University of Central Asia,"Grogan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.;Grogan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.",,,,,,,,37,12,12,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

Recent studies suggest that apart from the global determinants influencing broad inflation measures (e.g., plummeting commodity prices), core inflation components are subject to the rising influence of globalization. Our analysis focuses on two aspects: the percentage of Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) components affected by deflation, and the spillovers of headline, core, non-energy goods and services inflation between the euro area and selected small open economies. In order to address the issue of inflation broadness, we calculate the percentages of HICP components whose annual growth rates fall into certain ranges and introduce a simple measure, the discrepancy index, to show the relative strength of deflationary and inflationary groups. To address the problem of quantifying inflation spillovers across the selected economies, we use the Diebold and Yilmaz spillover indices. The results indicate that the share of deflationary groups for most countries has been consistently rising since 2010, with the discrepancy index approximating its all-time lows in the fourth quarter of 2014. Simultaneously we show that the spillover index for non-energy industrial goods and services inflation has recently risen considerably, with themeasure for headline inflation remaining elevated and the one for core inflation dropping. The euro area remains a net inflation transmitter in most cases.","[Halka, Aleksandra; Szafranek, Karol] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland; [Szafranek, Karol] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Szafranek, K (通讯作者)，Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",Karol.Szafranek@nbp.pl,,"Szafranek, Karol/0000-0003-4565-4529",,,,,33,12,12,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

It has been shown that in a mixed duopoly, price competition yields a larger profit for the private firm. This implies that firms face weaker competition under price competition, which contrasts sharply with the case of a private oligopoly. Here, we adopt a standard differentiated oligopoly with a linear demand. We find that regardless of the number of firms, price competition yields higher welfare. However, the profit ranking depends on the number of private firms. We find that if the number of private firms is greater than or equal to five, it is possible that quantity competition yields a larger profit for each private firm. We also endogenize the price-quantity choice. Here, we find that Bertrand competition can fail to be an equilibrium, unless there is only one private firm.","[Haraguchi, Junichi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Haraguchi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",7299572051@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; matusmur@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010","Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516",Murata Science Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [15k03347]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03347] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Murata Science Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","J.

To this end, we endogenize capital accumulation within a standard model of exchange rate determination with nontraded goods. The model predicts that currencies of countries that are more systemic for the world economy (countries that face particularly volatile shocks or account for a large share of world GDP) appreciate when the price of traded goods in world markets is high. These currencies are better hedges against consumption risk faced by international investors because they appreciate in bad states of the world. As a consequence, more systemic countries face a lower cost of capital and accumulate more capital per worker. We estimate our model using data from seven industrialized countries with freely floating exchange rate regimes between 1984 and 2010 and show that cross-country variation in the stochastic properties of exchange rates accounts for 72% of the cross-country variation in capital-output ratios. In this sense, the stochastic properties of exchange rates map to fundamentals in the way predicted by the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

But it is an open question whether and how higher levels of inequality actually lead to lower rates of mobility. We propose that one channel through which higher rates of income inequality might lead to lower rates of upward mobility is lower rates of human capital investment among low-income individuals. Specifically, we posit that greater levels of income inequality could lead low-income youth to perceive a lower rate of return on investment in their own human capital. Such an effect would offset any potential aspirational effect coming from higher educational wage premiums. The data are consistent with this prediction: Individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to drop out of school if they live in a place with a greater gap between the bottom and middle of the income distribution. This finding is robust in relation to a number of specification checks and tests for confounding factors. This analysis offers an explanation for how income inequality might lead to a perpetuation of economic disadvantage, and it has implications for the types of interventions and programs that would effectively promote upward mobility among youth of low socioeconomic status.","[Kearney, Melissa S.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Levine, Phillip B.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Wellesley College,"Kearney, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,Smith Richardson Foundation,Smith Richardson Foundation,"We are indebted to our discussants, Robert Moffitt and Miles Corak, and to our editors, Janice Eberly and James Stock, for detailed comments that have greatly improved this paper.

One possible explanation for this overbidding phenomenon is that bidders subjectively weight their winning probabilities. In the relevant literature, the probability weighting functions (PWFs) suggested to explain overbidding imply the underweighting of all probabilities. However, such functions are not in accordance with the PWFs commonly used in the literature (i.e., inverse S-shaped functions). In this paper we introduce inverse S-shaped PWFs into first-price sealed-bid auctions and investigate the extent to which such weighting functions explain overbidding. Our results indicate that bidders with low valuations underbid, whereas those with high valuations overbid. We accordingly conclude that inverse S-shaped PWFs provide a partial explanation for overbidding.","[Keskin, Kerim] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Keskin, K (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",kerim@bilkent.edu.tr,"Keskin, Kerim/C-9084-2019","Keskin, Kerim/0000-0001-8112-5574",,,,,21,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In addition, most studies do not make a distinction between the relative impacts of short-term versus long-term unemployment on wage inflation. Using state-level data from 1982 to 2013, we find strong evidence that the wage-price Phillips curve is nonlinear and convex; declines in the unemployment rate below the average unemployment rate exert significantly higher wage pressure than changes in the unemployment rate above the historical average. We also find that the short-term unemployment rate has a strong relationship with both average and median wage growth, while the long-term unemployment rate appears to only influence median wage growth.

The FDI fall would reduce exports and production of Japanese MNE affiliates in China and depreciate the Renminbi.

We begin by describing a variant of Plya urns, first introduced by Fred Hoppe, in which balls of previously non-existing colors are added with some (declining) probability. We then propose new variants in which the probability of the arrival of new colors is itself subject to adaptive change depending on the success of past innovations and discuss applications to evolutionary models of technologies and industries. We numerically simulate different specifications of these urns with adaptively changing mutation rate and show that they can account for complex patterns of evolution in which periods of exploration and innovation are followed by periods in which the dynamics of the system is driven by selection among a stable set of alternatives.","[Marengo, Luigi] LUISS Univ, Dept Business & Management, Rome, Italy; [Zeppini, Paolo] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Bath,"Marengo, L (通讯作者)，LUISS Univ, Dept Business & Management, Rome, Italy.",lmarengo@luiss.it; p.zeppini@bath.ac.uk,,"Zeppini, Paolo/0000-0002-1630-9462",,,,,23,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Motivated by the theoretical ambiguity regarding the sign of the marginal effects of additional siblings on children's outcomes, our empirical model allows for an unrestricted relationship between family size and child outcomes. We find that the conclusion in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) of no family size effect does not hold after relaxing their linear specification in family size. We find nonzero effects of family size in ordinary least squares estimation with controls for confounding characteristics like birth order and in instrumental variables estimation instrumenting family size with twin births. Estimation using a unrestricted specification for the quality-quantity relationship yields substantial family size effects. This finding suggests that social policies that provide incentives for fertility should account for spillover effects on existing children.","[Mogstad, Magne] Univ Chicago & Stat Norway, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL USA; [Wiswall, Matthew] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago & Stat Norway, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL USA.;Wiswall, M (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com; matt.wiswall@gmail.com,,,Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"Thanks to two anonymous referees, the editor, and a number of seminar and conference participants for useful comments and suggestions.

We use a dynamic framework from monetary theory to model permits. We derive properties of optimal permits trading mechanisms under private information concerning the firms' tendency to pollute. When the firms' capital vintage is fixed, both emissions taxes and trade in permits can support the first-best. Both policies, however, can fail to achieve efficiency if firms endogenously choose their composition of capital stock across clean and dirty vintages. If permit requirements and taxes depend on the firms' vintage composition, in addition to ex post emissions, both policies can support efficiency. In both setups, the banking of notes is not necessary and may even break this equivalence in favor of taxes.","[Monnet, Cyril] Study Ctr Gerzensee, Gerzensee, Switzerland; [Monnet, Cyril] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Temzelides, Ted] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX USA; [Temzelides, Ted] Rice Univ, James Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA",Study Center Gerzensee; University of Bern; Rice University; Rice University,"Temzelides, T (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX USA.;Temzelides, T (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, James Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA.",tedt@rice.edu,,"Monnet, Cyril/0000-0001-6376-4129",,,,,24,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Explanatory variables used alternatively in the price equation and in the switching equation include power demand, the supply of intermittent renewables, the residual supply index, and a congestion indicator. Four competing hypotheses on the determinants of price regimes are tested (arbitrary market power, cost profile, tacit collusion, congestion) in order to understand why, despite the general trend of declining prices induced by renewables in southern Italy, Sicilian prices stood high.

Instead, the results reveal significant anomalies in non-January months and that such effects vary across markets. This latter evidence might reflect different characteristics in these economies, including diverse levels of market efficiency, local risk factors, and portfolio management among others.

We address this issue using the quantile regression approach, enabling a more detailed investigation of structure and degree of dependence. Empirical results reveal that the reaction of market returns to crude oil is highly heterogeneous across conditional distribution of industry stock returns. Furthermore, there is evidence that this dependence is positive and exists only in recessions or bearish markets with low expected returns. The dependence at low quantiles is not limited to one market, but is a common feature across industries. Additionally, dependence also changes since the onset of structural breaks. We determine that Chinese industry stock and global crude oil markets have contagion in rare situations. Most cases do not demonstrate contagion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We do so using two alternative databases, covering about 190 world countries for the period 1960-2000. In line with previous estimates, we consistently find a significant, positive, impact of MSNs at destination. We also find that such an impact decreases very slowly as the year when MSNs are observed is farther back in the past. We also find that geographical distance is becoming less and less important over time but significantly explains the absence of a migration corridor only when MSNs at destination have very small sizes.","[Fagiolo, Giorgio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, Pisa, Italy; [Santoni, Gianluca] CEPII, Paris, France",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Fagiolo, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, Pisa, Italy.",giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; santoni, gianluca/AAJ-3958-2020","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352; santoni, gianluca/0000-0002-8853-0051",,,,,18,5,5,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The empirical results we obtain show that the null hypotheses of no Granger's causality from the exchange rate to other variables, investment and marginal q, are accepted in all industries.

Empirical evidence drawn from the Bank for International Settlements dataset on banks' portfolios shows that rapid financial integration, following the launch of the monetary union, resulted in excess exposure of Core countries' banks in the Peripheral countries' financial assets. In order to endogenize the possibility of contagion effects, we conduct econometric estimates through a Global Vector Autoregressive model, where each country's spread depends upon all Eurozone countries' spreads. Results show that after the burst of the financial crisis the Core countries' sovereign yields are essentially determined by the international risk aversion, whereas the spreads of Peripheral countries mainly depend on fundamentals, namely the public debt/GDP ratio and the Real Effective Exchange Rate values with respect to the Eurozone average. These results are supported by the estimate of an impulse response analysis. Macroeconomic failures in public finances and competitiveness seem to originate the exceptional increases in sovereign spreads of the Periphery, through a contagion effect which is limited to this group of Eurozone countries.","[Angelini, Elisabetta Croci; Valentini, Enzo] Univ Macerata, Macerata, Italy; [Farina, Francesco] Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Macerata; University of Siena,"Farina, F (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",fr.f.farina@gmail.com,"Valentini, Enzo/AAH-8678-2019","Valentini, Enzo/0000-0002-9056-7320; farina, francesco/0000-0002-6300-4506",,,,,43,5,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2016,43,1,,,,,197,213,,10.1007/s10663-015-9300-8,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DC1TB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368998600008,0

Assessing the predictability of a time series is the first mandatory step in order to further apply low-risk and efficient price forecasting methods. According to conventional entropy-based analysis (where the entropy is always ex-post estimated), high entropy values characterize unpredictable series, while more stable series exhibits lesser entropy values. Here, we predict (i.e. ex-ante) the entropy regarding the future behavior of a series, based on the observation of historical data. Our prediction is performed according to the optimum least squares minimization algorithm, usually used in many computational aspects of management science. Preliminary results, applied to energy commodity futures, show the effectiveness of the proposed method for application to energy market time series. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time economic theory has a hard time providing an instrumental explanation for the existence of accountability journalism. According to the common Downsian reasoning, rational voters should not be willing to pay for information out of purely instrumental motives because the individual probabilities of casting the decisive vote are typically very low. We show that this rationale does not apply when a group of voters shares a common goal such as accountability and information is delivered via mass media. In contrast to the pessimistic Downsian view, rational voters can have a considerable willingness to pay for the provision of instrumental information in these scenarios. Our model thus reconciles the rational voter approach with the common perception of journalism as a watchdog that holds elected officials accountable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This situation has shown to be pervasive in Latin America. As Argentina is a salient instance of this phenomenon, we develop a stylized model of its economy at the first decades of the XXth century. It consists of a general equilibrium model of an open emerging economy, which is a price-taking primary goods exporter. A growth process is triggered by an increase of commodity prices, due to an upward jump of the world demand of these goods. The economy goes through several phases of growth, starting from a subsistence stage. Once decreasing returns set in, the economy reaches a steady state. Only a sustained high demand of its export products allows the economy to thrive. Otherwise, the economy gets entrapped in a middle income level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present results from an experiment in which participants decide on redistribution after performing a real effort task. Dependent on individual performance, participants are divided into two groups, successful and unsuccessful. Participants' success is exogenously determined, because they are randomly assigned to either a hard or easy task. However, because participants are not told which task they were assigned to, there is ambiguity as to whether success or failure should be attributed to internal or external factors. Participants take two redistribution decisions. First, they choose a supply of redistribution in a situation where no personal interests are at stake. Second, they choose a redistributive system behind a veil of ignorance. Our results confirm and expand previous findings on the self-serving bias: successful participants are more likely to attribute their success to their effort rather than luck, and they opt for less redistribution. Unsuccessful participants tend to attribute their failure to external factors and opt for more redistribution. We demonstrate that the self-serving bias contributes to a polarization of the views on redistribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding their origins, and what mechanisms help to attenuate such acts is an underexplored area of research. This study takes an economic approach to explore the propensity of individuals to act dishonestly across different contexts. We conduct an experiment that includes both parents and their young children as subjects, exploring the roles of moral cost and scrutiny on dishonest behavior. We find that the highest level of dishonesty occurs in settings where the parent acts alone and the dishonest act benefits the child. In this spirit, there is also an interesting, quite different, effect of children on parents' behavior: parents act more honestly under the scrutiny of daughters than under the scrutiny of sons. This finding sheds new light on the origins of the widely documented gender differences in cheating behavior observed among adults, where a typical result is that females are more honest than males.

Electricity distribution network capacity is primarily driven by periodic demand, and household load generally peaks in the early evening, whereas solar PV production peaks during the middle of the day and thus a mismatch exists. Compounding matters is the fact that the structure of the regulated two-part network tariff is dominated by a flat-rate variable charge. In this article, interval meter data at the customer switchboard circuit level confirms that solar households use only slightly less peak capacity than non-solar households and, that non-trivial cross-subsidies are rapidly emerging. A tariff model demonstrates that a peak capacity-based 'demand tariff is a more efficient, cost-reflective and equitable pricing structure that improves the stability of tariffs given a rate-of-return regulatory constraint.

Consistent with the predictions of a human capital-augmented Solow model, we find that the growth rate (along the path to the steady-state income level) of per capita GDP is negatively correlated with population growth rate and positively correlated with investment rate in physical capital and human capital. We find that FDI has a positive effect on the per capita GDP growth rate and this effect is intensified by the human capital endowment of the city. The latter suggests that one way that human capital contributes to growth is to serve as a facilitator for technology transfers stemming from FDI. Furthermore, we find some suggestive evidence that the FDI-human capital complementary effect is stronger for technology intensive FDI than for labor-intensive FDI. Our results are robust to alternative measures of human capital, model specifications, and estimation methods.

While tax competition limits the extent to which redistribution is possible as compared to the closed-economy outcome when skilled people are internationally mobile, I argue that race to the bottom does not necessarily occur, even if the number of countries becomes arbitrarily large. The asymptotic sustainability of the welfare state crucially depends on the statistical properties of the probability distribution of skilled people's location preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, these indicators can be further decomposed into four factors: pure efficiency change, scale efficiency change, pure technology change, and scale of technology change. These decompositions enable a determination of which specific energy input is the driving force of energy productivity change and which of the four factors is the primary contributor of energy productivity change. An empirical analysis of China's energy productivity change over the period 1997-2012 indicates that (i) China's energy productivity growth may be overestimated if energy consumption structure is omitted; (ii) in regard to the contribution of specific energy input toward energy productivity growth, oil and electricity show positive contributions, but coal and natural gas show negative contributions; (iii) energy-specific productivity changes are mainly caused by technical changes rather than efficiency changes; and (iv) the Porter Hypothesis is partially supported in China that carbon emissions control regulations may lead to energy productivity growth.

By calling this assumption into question, behavioural findings cause fundamental problems for normative economics. A common response to these problems is to treat deviations from conventional rational choice theory as mistakes, and to try to reconstruct the preferences that individuals would have acted on, had they reasoned correctly. We argue that this preference purification approach implicitly uses a dualistic model of the human being, in which an inner rational agent is trapped in an outer psychological shell.

I here further investigate one particular such appeal to evolutionary biology: the argument that, since markets select (in a standard biological sense) firms as coherent units, firms should be seen to be genuine economic agents. To assess this argument, I present a model of firm/office selection in a competitive market, and show that there are cases where markets can select for firms/offices as collective units - and thus, as agents of their own - but also that there are cases where they do not. In this way, I try to make the evolutionary argument for the agency-based view of the firm more precise.","[Schulz, Armin W.] Univ Kansas, Dept Philosophy, 3010 Wescoe Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Schulz, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Philosophy, 3010 Wescoe Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",awschulz@ku.edu,,,,,,,70,4,4,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Research issues that drive our study are: Does economic growth tend to raise all boats as Kuznets (1955) pointed out? What is the role of the pattern of growth in the process of development? Which factor must we consider in designing appropriate pro-poor growth policies? This paper finds considerable variation in the poverty-reducing effectiveness of growth across time and authors. Also, our analysis speaks in favour of the fact that as growth occurs poverty reduces, no matter the level of inequality. Identically, similar growth pattern has different effects on poverty reduction. We conclude that growth is good for poverty alleviation but it is not enough. The extent to which growth reduces poverty depends upon how we measure poverty, and upon absorptive capacity of the poor, the pace and pattern of growth. In times when the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, trickle-down effect becomes a scenario that need to be reviewed.","[Skare, Marinko; Prziklas Druzeta, Romina] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Družeta, Romina Pržiklas/X-7993-2019; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Prziklas Druzeta, Romina/0000-0002-8983-5201",Croatian Science Foundation Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm [9481],Croatian Science Foundation Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

We vary the nature of information that could be transmitted (either a subjective rating or the objective details of a transaction), as well as the cost of information transmission (either zero or positive). We find that information transmission is heavily used if it is costless but only moderately if it has positive cost. Objective information effectively increases the average amount sent in the trust game (and thus, efficiency and average profits) as well as the return rate only if transmission is costless and therefore is heavily used. Subjective information (a rating) only increases transfer and return rates in a control treatment where it becomes publicly available, but not for private communication. A detailed analysis of the determinants of information transmission shows a positive influence of (a) the transfer made to a receiver, (b) experience of exploitation, and (c) points to reciprocity in information transmission.

The SOE's government uses linear taxation to fund exogenous expenditures and uses public debt to inter-temporally allocate tax distortions. We characterize a class of environments in which the tax on labor goes to zero in the long run, while the tax on capital income may be non-zero, reversing the standard prediction of the Ramsey tax literature. The zero labor tax is an optimal long run outcome if the economy is subject to sovereign debt constraints and the domestic households are impatient relative to the international interest rate. The front loading of tax distortions allows the economy to build a large (aggregate) debt position in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a similar result holds in a closed economy with imperfect inter-generational altruism, providing a link with the closed-economy literature that has explored disagreement between the government and its citizens regarding inter-temporal tradeoffs.

Even though literature indicates the importance of teamwork on innovativeness of organizations, the recognition of organizational innovativeness in tourism is a relatively recent phenomenon and especially its contribution to increased competitiveness. In this paper we present the results of an empirical research among tourism organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is argued that teamwork efficiency should be measured and that efficient teamwork has positive impact of innovativeness in tourism organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presented empirical research aims to clarify the significance of teamwork and innovativeness in tourism organizations and to provide understanding of teamwork measurement and efficiency and to test its influence on organization 's innovativeness. Hypotheses regarding the relationship of teamwork and innovativeness are tested based on data collected from managers and team members in tourism organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Employing the factor analysis, we reduced number of variables to four factors. Cluster analysis is used to group SMEs according to factors that constrain their innovation activities. SMEs are grouped into three clusters. Results reveal that firms are mostly constrained by external factors. In two out of three clusters, firms report high intensity of financial constraints to their innovation activity.

The result is the launch of defence mechanisms, which aim for minimizing the damage and securing the survival of the company. Effective communication in global crisis is more important than ever before. Any company regardless of its size and sector of operation can be hit by the crisis. Companies must simply count with crisis. The fundamental question nowadays is not whether the company will be affected by a crisis yet when the crisis comes and in what form it will come. Every company should be ready in advance for the crisis so it can eliminate potential damage, which the crisis will bring along. The management of the company must know how to proceed, when the crisis hits it. Paper deals with significance and importance of crisis communication in conditions of global crisis. The crisis communication is an important tool, through which the company can influence the progress of crisis situation. The main goal of crisis communication is to provide the right information, at the right time, at the right place. Although the crisis communication is an important tool, in our businesses it is often underestimated and the management does not pay it enough attention, time and preparation. Failure to manage the crisis situation can result in threatening the sole essence and existence of the company that is why it is important to pay more attention to this issue.","[Capkovicova, Bronislava; Bednarik, Jaroslav] Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Deparment Mkt Commun, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Bednárik, J (通讯作者)，Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Deparment Mkt Commun, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",capkovicova.brona@gmail.com; jaroslav.bednarik@ucm.sk,"Bednárik, Jaroslav/HKN-7409-2023","Bednárik, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9481-351X",[VEGA 1/0640/15],,The paper is a part of research project VEGA 1/0640/15 named: Phygital Concept and Its Use in Sustainable Integrated Environmental Management of Businesses.,,23,6,6,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,295,302,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800038,0

The import and export equations are derived from the imperfect substitute goods model of trade and are estimated with monthly data for the period 1994-2014 using Johansen's cointegration approach. We find that all variables can be described as processes with stochastic trends and that there exists one cointegration relation for each trade equation. In both cases, the estimated long run elasticities with respect to prices and income are statistically significant and consistent with economic theory. In particular, both trade flows are inelastic with respect to their respective relative prices although these findings are consistent with the Marshall-Lerner condition. Additionally, Mexican imports are elastic with respect to real aggregate production, a fact that confirms that Mexico's economic growth is highly dependent on imported goods. Differently than other studies, we find that Mexican exports are inelastic to industrial production in USA during this period, which implies that they have become more stable against fluctuations in the neighbor's economy.","[Cermeno, Rodolfo S.; Rivera Ponce, Huver] CIDE, Div Econ, Republ, London, England",,"Cermeño, RS; Ponce, HR (通讯作者)，CIDE, Div Econ, Republ, London, England.",rodolfo.cermeno@cide.edu; huver.rivera@presidencia.gob.mx,,,,,,,45,2,3,0,16,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We present a model economy where earnings and wealth distributions are comparable to those in the micro data. We find that the aggregate labor supply elasticity of such an economy is around 1, which is greater than the typical micro estimates but smaller than those often assumed in the aggregate models.

Our analysis also shows that the TPP members increase their imports from other TPP members and decrease from non-TPP members, but the trade creation effects exceed the trade diversion effects.

More committed importers contribute more to the exporters' performance than do less committed importers. The purpose of this paper is to examine one of the factors that motivate importers to be committed to their overseas exporters: exporter fairness. Specifically, this study examines the role of exporter fairness in developing importer commitment. Fairness is conceptualized as three dimensions: distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice. Design/methodology/approach - The relationship between the three dimensions of exporter fairness and importer commitment is empirically examined using data collected from 120 Korean importers. Partial least squares technique was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings - It was found that importers' perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice contribute to increasing or decreasing importer commitment. Furthermore, when a sample of Korean importers was split into two groups, the three dimensions of justice were positively related to commitment for importers facing a highly volatile business environment, while only interactional justice significantly affected commitment for importers facing a low-volatile environment. These findings indicate that importers facing a highly volatile environment are much more sensitive to exporter fairness than are those facing a low-volatile environment. Originality/value - The study demonstrates that importer commitment can be developed, particularly in highly volatile environments, if vulnerable importers are treated fairly by their more powerful exporters.

A Bayesian panel vector autoregression (VAR) model with real and financial variables identifies significant common components, especially during the Great Recession. Nevertheless, country-specific factors remain important, which is consistent with the heterogeneous behavior observed across countries over time. We also find that spillovers across countries and between real and financial variables are key to explain economic fluctuations. A shock to a variable in a given country affects all other countries, and the transmission seems to be faster and deeper between financial variables than between real variables. For a shock to a financial variable to have a noticeable effect on the real economy elsewhere, it needs to be either common to all countries or to have originated in a systemic country.","[Ciccarelli, Matteo] European Cent Bank DG Res, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ortega, Eva] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain; [Valderrama, Maria Teresa] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Vienna, Austria",European Central Bank; Banco de Espana; Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Ciccarelli, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank DG Res, Sonnemannstr 22, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",Matteo.Ciccarelli@ecb.int,,"Ortega, Eva/0000-0003-2587-6044",,,,,28,12,12,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

It is found that while the test is relatively robust in the presence of 'low volatility' GARCH processes, it exhibits substantial size distortion when large values of the volatility parameter are considered. Attempted resolution via the routine application of heteroscedasticity consistent (or 'corrected') covariance matrix estimators (HCCMEs) is shown to result in overwhelming size distortion due to their impact upon the finite-sample distribution of the underlying test statistic. However, application of a corrected HCCME, in combination with critical values derived specifically under its use, results in the control of test size. Analogous results for the Dickey-Fuller (1979) test are presented to permit comparison with a test considering linear, symmetric adjustment. It is found that the AESTAR test is subject to far greater distortion than its linear, symmetric alternative. In summary, the results indicate that caution must be exercised when applying the AESTAR test to macroeconomic and financial time series, particularly if routine application of corrected covariance matrix estimators occurs.","[Cook, Steve] Swansea Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Cook, S (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",s.cook@swan.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Some key aspects of entrepreneurial activity reflected by Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity, Perceived Opportunities and Perceived Capabilities were taken into account based on The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database. In addition, in order to reflect the structural rigidities and tensions from the labour market, the unemployment rate provided by the World Bank's World Development Indicators database was considered as a control variable. The effect of the inclusion of a country in a certain development group, according to the most recent World Bank classification (low-income economies to high-income economies), was also considered in a multi-level analytical framework with a two-level model.

The positive effects of globalization in the EU in the freight transport area are achievement complex liberalization of the rail freight market and the gradual increase of its competitiveness in relation to other transport mode. Therefore, it is needed to update the legal framework so that it reflects the changing business conditions. Besides the basic legislation (primary and secondary EU law, national legal framework) operators of rail freight transport must also abide with other regulations and rules by the EU and UIC, which are primarily related to technical and technological transport conditions. New database solution simplifies monitoring and update these regulations and rules by providing them in the form of software application. The paper deals with evaluation of investment efficiency in the new database solution for rail freight transport. The methodology is based on economic analysis costs and benefits of investment i.e. CBA. Financial analysis is founded on dynamic methods of investment evaluation. One of the most difficult tasks is cash flow estimation. The difficulty of this task consists in the issue of counting all cash flow related to this investment whom they will occur in the future.

This is because, in a global dataset spanning 121 countries over the past four decades, changes in the share of income of the poorest quintiles are uncorrelated with changes in average income. The variation in changes in quintile shares is also small relative to the variation in growth in average incomes, implying,that the latter accounts for most of the variation in income growth in the poorest quintiles. In addition, we find little evidence that changes in the bottom quintile shares are correlated with country-level factors that are typically considered as important determinants for growth in average incomes or for changes in inequality. This evidence confirms the central importance of economic growth for improvements in living standards at the low end of the income distribution.

After identifying the main determinants of the long-run target (strategy), we focus on which interest rate conditions allow for a temporary deviation (tactics). The study is partly motivated by the apparent window of opportunity to issue more heavily at longer maturities given the recent historically low yields. We show that the room for long tactical positions on the long-term bond is actually narrower than predicted by rules of thumb based on Sharpe-like ratios. Once the model is augmented to embed real world features such as no price-taking and transaction costs, the scope for tactical position shrinks further. We discuss the model results and its implications in terms of the principal agent dilemma (government vs. debt manager); the paper also explores the financial stability implications arising from public debt issuance choices.

Psychological barriers are found to be present in Brent prices but not in WTI prices, which is argued to be due to the more prominent role that Brent plays as a global benchmark and, based on recent behavioural finance research, the greater complexity inherent in Brent fundamental value determination. Brent particularly displays evidence that when breaching a $10 barrier level from below with rising prices, the trend is for prices to fall on average subsequently. Similar behavioural-based patterns are evidenced at the $1 barrier level for the WTI-Brent spread. We show that psychological barriers only appear to influence prices in the pre-credit crisis period of 1990-2006, with such effects dissipating during the crisis and as markets reverted back to wider economy focused fundamentals. A range of reaction windows are applied with the main finding being that the trading potential around such psychological barrier levels is primarily in the immediate 1-5 days following a breach. The research contributes to the scant existing research on psychological influences on energy market traders, and suggests strong potential for further application of behavioural finance theories to improving understanding of energy markets price dynamics.

Then we create dummy variables for simultaneous asset bubbles and analyse potential determinants using gravity models and spatial economics. Our empirical analysis suggests that simultaneous asset bubbles depend positively upon potential asset demand, capital account openness, monetary conditions, cultural similarities and negatively upon informational frictions and exchange rate flexibility. These findings imply that monetary policy can impede the probability of simultaneous asset bubbles by ensuring sound monetary conditions and choosing a flexible exchange regime.","[Drescher, Christian] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Herz, Bernhard] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Bayreuth,"Herz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.",bernhard.herz@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Another serious finding is that the assumption of a single steady-state for all regions often mismatches with the reality.

The theories of human behavior that they produced explored how optimal human agents, who were subject to no internal computational resource constraints of any kind, should make choices. During the second half of the twentieth century, empirical work laid bare the limitations of this approach. Human decision makers were often observed to fail to achieve maximization in domains ranging from health to happiness to wealth. Psychologists working during this period responded to these failures by largely abandoning holistic theory in favor of large-scale multiparameter models that retained many of the key features of the earlier models. Over the course of the last two decades, scholars combining neurobiology, psychology, economics, and evolutionary approaches have begun to examine alternative theoretical approaches. Their data suggest explanations for some of the failures of neoclassical approaches and have revealed new theoretical avenues for exploration. While neurobiologists have largely validated the economic and psychological assumption that decision makers compute and represent a single decision variable for every option considered during choice, their data also make clear that the human brain faces severe computational resource constraints which force it to rely on very specific modular approaches to the processes of valuation and choice.","[Glimcher, Paul W.] NYU, Ctr Neuroecon, New York, NY 10013 USA",New York University,"Glimcher, PW (通讯作者)，NYU, Ctr Neuroecon, New York, NY 10013 USA.",,,,,,,,0,4,4,0,2,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,85,96,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200006,0

The results showed that in connection to the trends in the social-service sector in years 2007 and 2014, the amount and the capacity of selected social-care facilities were most significantly reduced in relation to the number of population aged 65+ in the Prague, Usti, and Liberec region. The development of community-based social services for the elderly brought about the highest rise in users of these services per person aged 65+ mainly in South Bohemia, Pardubice, Hradec Kralove, and Liberec region. The comparison of similarities of regions in years 2007 and 2014 using the indicators of social-care services for the elderly also showed that among the least similar regions were the Prague, South Bohemia, Usti, Plzen, and South Moravia region in 2007.

To assess the actual differences and similarities in administrative burdens in the process of establishing a company, countries were grouped according to four indicators using a cluster analysis. To get insights into changes in a particular country and compare it with other EU countries in terms of administrative burdens for starting a company, data from 2004, 2007, and 2016 were used. The findings show that, despite intense pressure and extensive measures implemented in the EU to reduce administrative burdens, the differences among EU member countries are still remarkable and the relative performance of some countries worsens despite absolute lessening of burdens on the national level.","[Hojnik, Barbara Bradac; Rebernik, Miroslav; Crnogaj, Katja] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Entrepreneurship & Small Business Management, Razlagova 14, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Hojnik, BB (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Entrepreneurship & Small Business Management, Razlagova 14, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",barbara.bradac@um.si; rebernik@uni-mb.si; katja.crnogaj@um.si,"Hojnik, Barbara Bradač/X-7202-2019","Hojnik, Barbara Bradač/0000-0002-1314-9088",,,,,54,0,0,0,3,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

This raises the cost of capital for financing R&D externally, resulting in financing constraints on R&D, especially for firms with limited internal resources. Previous literature provided evidence for start-up firms on the role of patents as signals to investors, in particular to Venture Capitalists. This study adds to previous insights by studying the effects of firms' patenting activity on the degree of financing constraints on R&D for a panel of established firms. The results show that patents do indeed attenuate financing constraints for small firms where information asymmetries may be particularly high and collateral value is low. Larger firms are not only less subject to financing constraints, but also do not seem to benefit from a patent quality signal.","[Hottenrott, Hanna] DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Hottenrott, Hanna; Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, Leuven, Belgium; [Hottenrott, Hanna; Czarnitzki, Dirk] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] Nat Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England; [Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Maastricht University; KU Leuven,"Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, Leuven, Belgium.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",hottenrott@dice.hhu.de,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021; Hottenrott, Hanna/H-4014-2018; Hottenrott, Hanna/AAE-7037-2021; Hall, Bronwyn/JFK-7284-2023","Hottenrott, Hanna/0000-0002-1584-8106; Hall, Bronwyn Hughes/0000-0002-3802-5567",Flemish Science Foundation (FWO),Flemish Science Foundation (FWO)(FWO),"The authors thank Thorsten Doherr for help with retrieving the patent data and participants at the CONCORDi 2013 (Seville, Spain), the DRUID conference 2014 (Copenhagen, Denmark), the IIOC 2014 (Chicago, USA), and the EARIE conference 2014 (Milan, Italy) for helpful comments.

According to the calibration, when an economy does not face the ZLB constraint, there is no gap in the fluctuation of output and inflation between stochastic expectations and perfect foresight because of the linear policy functions. In contrast, once-negative aggregate demand shocks make the nominal interest rate hit the ZLB under stochastic expectations, unlike perfect foresight, intensifying uncertainty plays an important role in further declines of the output and price level even in response to the same shock, regardless of the monetary policy regime adopted. The calibration also indicates the possibility that the steady states of a model, in the absence of the ZLB, are underestimated in periods of deflation, since the means often used as estimates of the steady states are biased downward from these. The analysis sheds light on an exit strategy from the zero interest rate policy, since a passive policy regime reduces the expected interest rate and induces both the expected output and the inflation to increase under the ZLB.

Complete contracts entail state-contingent clauses that compensate the contractor for shocks unrelated to his own effort. By improving insurance, those contracts reduce the agency cost of moral hazard. When the contractor has private information on revenues shocks, verifying messages on shocks realizations is costly. Incomplete contracts do not specify state-contingent clauses, thereby saving on verifiability costs. This makes incomplete contracts attractive even though they entail greater agency costs. Because of private information on contracting costs, a public official may have discretion to choose whether to procure under a complete or an incomplete contract. When the public official is corrupt, such delegation results in incomplete contracts being chosen too often.

This paper analyzes the effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) on external tariffs in small economies where protection decisions are made politically. Our model determines tariff rates endogenously instead of assuming they are fixed during or after the formation of FTAs as commonly done in the literature. We show that when an FTA is established, the tariff rates that apply to non-members essentially decline. More importantly, we investigate the interaction between endogenous tariff determination and the feasibility of an FTA. We find that the expectation of tariff reductions under endogenous tariffs could make an otherwise feasible FTA if tariffs were fixed become infeasible. However, if domestic import-competing sectors are relatively smaller and the government places a significant weight on political contributions relative to social welfare, an FTA with endogenous tariffs may be more likely to be feasible than an FTA assumed to fix external tariffs.","[Karacaovali, Baybars] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Karacaovali, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Baybars@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,27,1,1,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Along with Putnam's three determinants of win-set size, the authors analyze a new set of policy factors - including Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), the FTA Domestic Planning Division, and the Trade Procedure Act - to examine the institutional arrangements available for the ratification of the TPP in Korea. Findings - To minimize the social cost of the internal negotiation process of the trade, better understanding of the role of domestic policy factors is essential. The paper proposes some important policy suggestions which will scale up the benefit of the trade. Research limitations/implications - The very same analysis can be easily extended to examine the domestic reactions for future FTA negotiation, especially for Mega FTA negotiation. Practical implications - The authors propose six policy suggestions: a Master Process Manual; measures to diagnose domestic reactions; emphasizing non-economic issues; strengthening human resources; considering the strategic role of the Trade Procedure Act; and reshaping TAA, to ensure that a tranquil environment exists for domestic negotiation and confirmation and the authors believe these policies can be implemented widely in trade negotiations. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the existing literature in at least three respects. First, the authors made the first attempt to integrate the domestic policy tools with the domestic determinants of trade negotiation outcomes. Second, the policy proposals can be extended to other countries' cases with a minor adjustment. Finally, the analysis is based on the assumption that international trade negotiations are multi-level frameworks where domestic influences play a vital role in the aftermath of bilateral FTAs.","[Kim, Jung Suk] Sogang Univ, Inst Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Ko, Bomin] Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Int Studies, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Heo, Yoon] Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jee Hoon] Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University; Catholic University of Korea; Sogang University; Sejong University,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Sejong Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",petra@sejong.ac.kr,,"Lee, Jee Hoon/0000-0001-8874-6867",,,,,34,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Although the bunching approach was originally developed in the context of taxation, it is beginning to find applications in many other areas, such as social security, social insurance, welfare programs, education, regulation, private sector prices, and reference-dependent preferences.

In today's global economy value is often created by intangible assets that arised from intellectual capital.

The problems relating to the accounting for intangibles are international in scope. This paper briefly reviews existing national Czech, Slovak, United Kingdom and United States accounting legislation and standards in comparison with International Financial Reporting Standards. Some inconsistencies are highlighted, and evidence is provided that suggests that recognition of intangible assets is in accordance with existing accounting principles. The reported differences may then affect the manner in which the level of company efficiency is reported, particularly when using traditional methods of share indexes of profitability. In harmony with the trend of the growing share of intangible assets in the overall assets of the company it is also very desirable to achieve international comparability of the companies' economic results.This article is based on analysis and comparisons of relevant literature resources, mainly articles and conference papers, but also legislative acts and monographs.","[Krizova, Zuzana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krízová, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",krizovaz@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1077,1084,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800134,0

By introducing a robust measure that captures systemic risk stemming from the Eurozone financial markets, namely the Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS), along with the most relevant macroeconomic variables in a richly specified Bayesian framework, we study the time varying impulse response functions in order to assess the structural changes that have appeared over the analyzed period. Our results suggest that, even though economies became less susceptible to systemic risk shocks after the outbreak of the financial crisis, recent years have brought a common development among analyzed countries, their main macroeconomic indicators seemingly growing more vulnerable to such shocks. We ascertain that, as a natural consequence of financial innovation, the financial system has become more robust by allowing a higher degree of connectivity and, subsequently, lowering the probability of systemic crisis episodes. Nevertheless, we also conclude that interconnectivity between financial institutions can lead to significant second-round effects, practically transforming the risk-sharing mechanism into a contagion transmission network, leading to potentially systemic events.","[Kubinschi, Matei; Barnea, Dinu] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Kubinschi, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",matei.kubinschi@bnro.ro; dinu.barnea@bnro.ro,"Kubinschi, Matei/IAO-1252-2023","Kubinschi, Matei/0000-0002-3938-1168","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-2499 entitled Coordinating Monetary and Macroprudential Policies.",,29,8,9,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The debate has resulted in introduction of Electronic Evidence of Sales, effective since 2016. However, the tax evasion may be decreased also by other, and probably more effective tools. The aim of this paper is to determine how tax fairness manifests itself in the society of developed countries. The basic hypothesis of this study argues that if the tax burden is relatively high and perceived as unfair by the society, it will cause a higher rate of tax evasion, and vice versa. The hypothesis is confirmed on the basis of a dynamic panel data analysis for OECD countries in 2003-2012. We conclude that national governments should try to increase the fairness, even while preserving higher rate of taxation, which means that they should try to change the perception of taxation by the public, e. g. by explaining them why the system is set in a way it is, but also should they try to remove the elements of tax system that are not in accordance with the fairness principle applied.","[Machova, Zuzana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kotlan, Igor] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Law, Nam Curieovych 7, Prague 11640 1, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Charles University Prague,"Machová, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zuzana.machova@mendelu.cz; kotlan@prf.cuni.cz,"Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021; Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020","Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600; Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216",,,,,26,1,1,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,408,415,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200043,0

The authors provide an analysis of costs of treatment and care in the selected countries where the data from the available studies are recalculated into comparable quantities. Furthermore, the authors analyse aspects and possibilities of care for patients with AD in the informal (home) environment in compliance with individual phases of this disease. In the article, the method of research of available sources focusing on social and economic issues of AD is used. In order to compare costs of treatment and care of the AD patients, the Qualitative Comparative Analysis Method is exploited.

The greatest maladjustment is found in the 1940s and 1950s, decades of strong exchange rate intervention in Spain. Conversely, the link between equilibrium and differentials adjusts to the hypothesis when using the non-intervened peseta/dollar exchange rate on the Tangier black market.

The proposed model was based on the analyses of primary and secondary sources in the environment of Microsoft Office Excel 2013. This model was implemented, verified and tested in the practice of selected micro and small enterprises. The model will support gathering and analysing of information for financial planning, setting financial goals and control with emphasis on analyse of the variance. It is expected that implementation of this model into the practice will held managers to dispose better information about the main financial indicators. According to these indicators they will make right, quick and effective financial decisions which help to improve the competitiveness and market value of micro and small enterprises.","[Markova, Viera] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Sedliacikova, Mariana; Gurova, Diana Hamary] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Technical University Zvolen,"Sedliaciková, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",viera.markova@umb.sk; sedliacikova@tuzvo.sk; didi.gurova@gmail.com,"Sedliacikova, Mariana/D-9055-2015",,,,,,21,6,6,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1305,1312,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800161,0

For this to happen, public policy needs to support innovation and direct future activities. Innovation policy must focus on building more symbiotic (less parasitic) innovation ecosystems.

Nevertheless, a robust positive relationship between services trade and recognition of qualifications is found. Recognition stimulates two-way trade between the source and the host country, suggesting that arms-length exports as well as cross-border outsourcing take place.

This process results mainly from information revolution. In globalization the management requires to take into account a crucial aspect - the safety. An increase in awareness of the safety and higher requirements concerning the safety caused a rapid progress in development of safety related science. Thanks to it, new techniques for identification of risk and formulas for it acceptance have been developed, quantitative and qualitative risk analysis has been applied. Progress in technology is one of main factors which drives and simplifies the process of globalization. This progress, apart from many advantages, can cause also many potential hazards. The technique accompanies the development of mankind, but only the industrial revolution trigged an abrupt increase in potential hazards, for example nuclear power plants, chemical industry, transport and so on. Because we cannot neglect all hazards generated by contemporary technique, it is necessary to limit the risk particularly in human losses, it can be realized by the safety improvement. Although the knowledge relevant to the safety is interdisciplinary, the significant part of the knowledge concerns technical problems. The paper is concerned with the safety from the point of view of globalization. The definitions for the risk, hazard and technical safety have been given.

The aim of this paper is to identify the influence of an enterprise's innovativeness on management of its current finances and maintenance of financial liquidity. The main thesis is: Financial liquidity of enterprises and ways of managing current finances depend on the level of innovativeness of enterprises. The verification of this hypothesis has been based on the results of questionnaire empirical studies conducted in 2014 on a group of 380 enterprises in Poland. The character of the studies was mainly qualitative, therefore statistical dependences were examined using: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as a measure of correlation between ordinal variables and Pearson's Chi-squared test and CramOr's V as a measure of association between nominal variables. The studies resulted in finding statistical dependencies that show the influence of innovativeness on the management of current finances of an enterprise, e. g., degree of management formalisation, competences, professionalization of employed methods.","[Okreglicka, Malgorzata] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Czestochowa, Poland",Technical University Czestochowa,"Okreglicka, M (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Czestochowa, Poland.",m.okreglicka@wp.pl,"Okreglicka, Malgorzata/X-2059-2018; Okręglicka, Małgorzata/K-7452-2019","Okreglicka, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5806-2322; Okręglicka, Małgorzata/0000-0002-5806-2322",,,,,40,6,6,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-22596-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,225,237,,10.1007/978-3-319-22596-8_16,0.0,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ0HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000416839900016,0

Some argue that non-profits are for-profits in disguise and I test this proposition in a quasi-experimental way by examining the exit behavior of home health care firms after a legislative change considerably reduced reimbursed visits per patient. The change allows me to construct a cross provider measure of restriction in reimbursement and to use this measure and time-series variation due to the passage of the law in my estimates. I find that exits among for-profit firms are higher than those of not-for-profit firms, rejecting the null that these sectors responded to the legislation in similar ways. In addition, my results expand the view that not-for-profit firms are a form of trapped capital. There is little capital investment in the home health care market, so the higher exit rates of for-profit firms after the law change indicate the possible role of labor inputs in generating differences in exit behavior across sectors.","[Orsini, Chiara] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Orsini, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",chrorsini@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The main hypothesis of the research is that governments' investment policies should further take into consideration the given ideological frame in order to decrease the unemployment and increase employment. Although the ideological models characterize left governments more sensitive in suppressing the unemployment with regards to the right-wing ones, on the contrary, higher unemployment was registered in Eastern Croatia in their governance. Therefore, left-wing Croatian governments must put considerable weight on increasing investment activities whereby opportunistic turning towards middle voters will create them something easier position. If the right-wing governments follow more its ideological worldview, and also with the set economic goals want to reduce unemployment and increase employment in Eastern Croatia, then they will have something better position of left-wing governments, but their effect on the reduction of unemployment in eastern counties is still insufficient. If right-wing governments try to turn to the, middle voters instead of abiding by their ideologies, this would only make their position worse in the whole unemployment decrease process in Eastern Croatia because that would mean falling effect of investments on employment. All the Croatian governments in implementing economic policy must additionally change the structure employed by the production sector and in particular stress regional equalization and efficiency in reducing unemployment and employment growth in Eastern Croatia, which would reduce the emigration of the active workforce seeking a steady employment abroad.","[Piplica, Damir] Univ Dept Profess Studies Split, Kopilica 5, Split, Croatia; [Speranda, Ivo] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Split; University of Dubrovnik,"Piplica, D (通讯作者)，Univ Dept Profess Studies Split, Kopilica 5, Split, Croatia.",damir.piplica@gmail.com; ivo.speranda@unidu.hr,"Piplica, Damir/ABF-4587-2020",,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,972,981,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600097,0

Alongside said analytical elements, and considering Spain's membership in the Eurozone monetary union system, this characterisation of the euphoria and subsequent balance-sheet recession further identifies specific features of the Spanish economy that informed current outcomes.","[Sanabria Martin, Antonio; Medialdea Garcia, Bibiana] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Martín, AS; García, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Sanabria, Antonio/R-6858-2018; Medialdea, Bibiana/AAA-9630-2019","Medialdea, Bibiana/0000-0002-0627-661X",,,,,32,13,13,0,3,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63,2,,,SI,,195,210,,10.2298/PAN1602195M,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,DM2YK,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376213800004,0

We estimate sibling correlations and intergenerational correlations in self-reported life satisfaction, satisfaction with household income, job satisfaction, and satisfaction with health. We find high sibling correlations for all measures of well-being. The results suggest that family background explains, on average, between 30% and 60% of the inequality in permanent well-being. The influence is smaller when the siblings' psychological and geographical distance from their parental home is larger. Results from intergenerational correlations suggest that parental characteristics are considerably less important than family and community factors.","[Wunder, Christoph] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ, Inst Labour Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Leibniz University Hannover; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Wunder, C (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",christoph.wunder@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,30,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Many econometric models have been constructed based on various theoretical approaches (neoclassical economics, Keynesian, business cycle, post Keynesian and others) aiming to predict peaks and pitfalls in the economies. But unfortunately many of them were misleading in predicting 2007-2008 financial crisis and long lasting recession afterwards. The literature indicates plenty of negative aspects of recent financial crisis at macro-level including decrease in consumption, aggregate demand and investment, financial markets' stagnation, increase in Government debt and unemployment rate and even more political instability. While effects at micro level encompass the decline in business loans, fall in equity value, property devaluation, decrease in sales, increase in defaults, decrease in investment in R&D and etc. Especially small open economies, like Lithuania, have suffered most in terms of shrinkage of GDP during the 2007-2009 period. Therefore the qualitative approach is valuable in deepening the knowledge about the preconditions and consequences of credit shocks. Thus this study aims to extract the main prerequisites and outcomes for credit shocks and to approve it by the expert opinion. Expert evaluation results indicate that absence of reserve funds was the most important precondition for 2007-2008 crisis and recession. Moreover when the gathered unplanned cyclical income have been wasted and even more the public sector spending has been increased that led to even bigger budget deficit. Also experts unanimously identified the main consequences of credit shock and 2007-2009 crisis including: (1) Decrease in GDP and government revenues, (2) Fall in domestic demand in Lithuania and increase in importance of exports for economic development, (3) The decline in consumption level and the delay of purchase, and (4) Shrinkage of construction sector, and manufacturing and trade of durable goods.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Venckuviene, Vitalija; Masteikiene, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V; Venckuviene, V; Masteikiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt; vitalija.venckuviene@ktu.lt; ruta.masteikiene@ktu.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,40,2,3,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

One of the practical solutions to that problem can be found in the development of sustainable public transport systems providing mobility, accessibility and customer service comparable to private vehicles. Sustainable transport systems are designed to improve the service quality, reduce pollution, limit the state subsidies to urban transport, increase the efficiency of transport networks and land usage, enhance the mobility of people with disabilities and prevent conflicts of interests among the public transportation stakeholders. The development of sustainable public transport systems brings together engineers, researchers, marketing specialists, urban designers and customer service managers, social workers to produce the innovative solutions to public transportation and help create universal strategies to global problems associated with urbanization. A sustainable transport system must also provide mobility and accessibility to all urban residents in a safe and environment-friendly mode of transport. This is a complex task when the needs and demands of different people may not only be different but often conflicting. The article focuses on marketing approach to standardizing the quality of public transport services, examines organizational issues of public transportation management systems.

The aim of the research is to forecast the trends of dynamics of the marketing paradigms. The most realistic issue is the transition from the relationship marketing paradigm where the producer of the goods dominates over its buyer in order to improve and adapt with the change of technological structure and consumer psychology. As part of the study of the marketing paradigm cycle the author concluded that paradigms represent a dynamic cyclic model. All stages of the paradigm cycle, modifications including, are simultaneously present in the target market segments due to the customer loyalty, having situational point. This circumstance determines the migratory nature of consumer segments in the context of the total number of consumer audience. The article also examines the question of the marketing paradigms transformation and globalization patterns. The aim of the study is to identify the main patterns and forecast the transformation of marketing paradigms. The author's interpretation of the evolution of marketing paradigms development allows to conclude that the Genesis of marketing paradigms assumes their transformation with centrifugal deployment of the evolutionary spiral along the time axis from the past to the future. The author also infers that between the previous and the subsequent stage of each cycle a number of marketing concepts are being formed and keep on existing in the future, which are prerequisite and necessary for the essential transformation of the current evolutionary stage and its further replacement by the next one.","[Syaglova, Yuliya] Prospekt Vernadskogo 82, Moscow 119571, Russia",,"Syaglova, Y (通讯作者)，Prospekt Vernadskogo 82, Moscow 119571, Russia.",y.syaglova@mail.ru,"SYAGLOVA, YULIYA/N-3592-2015",,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2182,2190,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800271,0

We estimate both linear and asymmetric monetary policy reaction functions for the period before inflation targeting was adopted, for the period when inflation targeting was explicitly adopted and for the full sample period. The results of the linear monetary policy rules are consistent with the estimates reported from other studies that estimate linear monetary policy rules for Australia. On the other hand, the results of estimating the asymmetric monetary policy rules for the pre-inflation targeting period shows that the RBA had reacted symmetrically, suggesting that it had acted with the same aggressiveness towards both inflation and output gaps of the same magnitude, over both phases of the business cycle. However, for the inflation targeting period, the results show that the RBA had reacted asymmetrically in its policy response to the inflation gap, output gap or both. A similar result is found for the full sample period. This asymmetric response supports the view that a non-linear monetary policy rule emanated from asymmetric preferences, rather than from the existence of a non-linear Phillips curve.","[Tawadros, George B.] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Tawadros, GB (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",George.Tawadros@rmit.edu.au,,"Tawadros, George/0000-0003-1578-957X",Australian Centre for Financial Studies,Australian Centre for Financial Studies,"The author would like to thank Benjamin Durance for excellent research assistance.

In accordance with those trends, there occur changes in the affinities and preferences of the 'new' tourism consumers, which in the end resulted in the development of special forms of tourism, the most notable of which is the cultural tourism. As the terms cultural tourism and 'cultural' tourist are considered to be relatively new terminological terms in Croatian academic community, but also in the sector of tourism in general, it seems legitimate to provide a concise theoretical analysis of this special type of tourism. In order to ensure the most relevant theoretical comprehensions and conclusions possible, this work will use the scientific method of analysis and synthesis, as well as the historical and descriptive method. Since the cultural tourism itself is a narrowly specialized market niche and is characterized as a dominant touristic product which is being given a considerable attention during the past decade in Croatia, one of the primary goals of this work is to provide an analysis and an overview of the most recognizable cultural resources in eastern Croatia which show good examples of the connection of culture and tourism and which could be an incentive to put tourism and other less-known cultural resources into function. In order to indicate the importance of cultural tourism as the backbone of still not sufficiently developed touristic areas of eastern Croatia, an empirical research will be made whose main purpose is to determine the current state of tourist and cultural resource base but also the main limiting factors from the aspect of the co-creators of national tourism policy. In order to collect primary data on a convenient sample, the method of in-depth interview will be used. The aim of this work is to define the main guidelines for the development of tourism, based on the valorisation of cultural resources of Eastern Croatia, with the purpose of advising the Ministry of tourism of the Republic of Croatia about promoting the cultural tourism.","[Tubic, Dejan; Jakovic, Bozidar; Bakan, Rikard] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Tubic, D (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr; bozidar.jakovic@vsmti.hr; rikard.bakan@vsmti.hr,"Bakan, Rikard/JDW-9938-2023",,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1003,1012,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600100,0

In that matter we analyzed sigma (sigma) and beta (beta) convergences among the five European countries which accessed the European Union in 2004 and among five old EU member countries. In the context of analyzing services confidence convergence, and as a subdivision of services, we put a special focus on convergence in Tourism sector. By analyzing beta convergence we tested the volume of tourist arrivals and nights spent by tourists. Time series data for all selected variables covers the period between the years 2003 and 2011. Our results confirm that convergence of Service Confidence Indicator occurred in the service sector at the rate of 0,6 % during the whole analyzed period between the years 2003 and 2011 and 2,2 % and 0,9 % during the sub periods between the years 2003 and 2007 as well as in the sub period 2009 and 2011, respectively. We also found out that the group of EU-5 economies is converging towards the group of CEE-5 economies. Regarding the results of testing beta convergence for both selected variables in Tourism sector, no convergence was found, meaning that the initial volume of tourist arrivals and nights spent by tourists did not influence its growth rate over the period between the years 2003 and 2011.","[Vojinovic, Borut] Univ Maribor, Fac Tourism, Cesta Prvih Borcev 36, Brezice SI-8250, Slovenia; [Brezovnik, Bostjan] Univ Maribor, Fac Law, Mladinska Ulica 9, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Oplotnik, Zan Jan] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, Maribor SI-2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Vojinovic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Tourism, Cesta Prvih Borcev 36, Brezice SI-8250, Slovenia.",borut.vojinovic@um.si; bostjan.brezovnik@um.si; zan.oplotnik@uni-mb.si,"Oplotnik, Zan J/B-4546-2013; Vojinovic, Borut/Q-7717-2019","Vojinovic, Borut/0000-0002-6417-6166; Oplotnik, Zan Jan/0000-0001-5579-2955; Brezovnik, Bostjan/0000-0001-8297-9862",,,,,31,5,5,1,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In many cases this has included emphasising the need for individuals to take more responsibility for their own retirement planning through tax incentives, compulsion and changes to the age at which state retirement benefits become available. In the case of Australia, as is considered here, long term retirement planning has been focused around the development of a compulsory defined contribution (DC) superannuation system. Here we investigate the interaction between population ageing and the sustainability of the superannuation system by modelling a general superannuation scheme to compare the adequacy of retirement funds under a number of alternative scenarios. The model incorporates stochastic longevity forecasts and provides insight into the sufficiency of compulsory retirement saving both now and future. We find that the current pension scheme is more robust to longevity improvements for mid-class individuals however significant gaps arise for low-income individuals as longevity improves. Without addressing these issues, government expenditure is expected to increase substantially. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Later he became a Belgian social-democratic leader. He published between 1931 and 1935 18 economic articles in the Bulletin d'Information et de Documentation of the National Bank of Belgium. It is shown that the articles, partly inspired by Keynes's writings up to 1931, are rather reflecting early Keynesian economic ideas relating to government intervention and public works, and do not contain any reference to the multiplier mechanism. A number of arguments in the articles are, however, advocating a Marxist inspired underconsumption theory. Based on further analysis of these articles, it is concluded that they contain also other important characteristics in common with the post-Keynesian neo-Marxist economic theories developed after the Second World War, such as the importance attached to the external markets of capitalism and a rejection of the labor theory of value, as well as a neglect of the Marxian law of the falling rate of profits. Their economic ideas are rooted in Marxism and the analysis of new economic phenomena, including the early Keynesianism of John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, they should be considered as an early version of these theories.","[Cuyvers, Ludo] Univ Antwerp, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Cuyvers, L (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Prinsstr 13, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",ludo.cuyvers@uantwerpen.be,"Cuyvers, Ludo/ABE-2557-2020",,,,,,63,1,2,0,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Our findings suggest that the per capita energy use in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland has a convergent pattern.

A cross-section survey was conducted among 185 borrowers from two microfinance institutions and 209 non-borrowers in rural areas of Cte d'Ivoire. In addition, a focus group discussion was held with each of the two women groups. After matching the two groups on the probability of obtaining credit, we found that the microcredit group on average had a higher income and a higher value of household assets than the non-borrowers. No differences in the value of personal women's assets were found. Furthermore, on one hand women's decision-making power in the household, as indicated by their strategic gender needs, was positively related to the probability of obtaining microcredit. On the other hand receiving microcredit tended to increase their decision-making power.","[Fofana, Namizata Binate] FHB Univ, Econ & Management Dept, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Antonides, Gerrit; Niehof, Anke; van Ophem, Johan A.

However, mixed empirical findings have resulted in a long-standing debate. This study explores the global FIJI-growth relationship through an 'informed' econometric analysis predicated on substantial guidance obtained from a detailed investigation of 880 estimates reported in 108 published studies. With model uncertainties alleviated and the core specification benchmarked against the aforementioned assessment, our econometric analysis, utilising a global sample of 140 countries in the period 1970 to 2009, conclusively documents that FIJI positively affects economic growth. Moreover, we find that this association holds globally as strongly as in the developing world. Further, it is regional variation rather than within-country variation, and contemporaneous FIJI rather than past FIJI, which matters for growth. Finally, appropriate absorptive capacity indicators for positive growth are identified to be trade openness and financial development rather than schooling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The abundance of monetary easing decisions can be used as a viable sign of market misbehaviour in addition to the low probability of extreme exchange rate fluctuations. Indeed, the temporal distribution of extreme currency fluctuations provides vital information about the nature of the recent crisis. Contagions can be defined as increased correlations during periods of crisis, while divergence means a significant decrease in this regard. Methodologically, common movements in this study were calculated by using DCC-GARCH modelling. The findings of this study underline the special features of the Swiss franc exchange rate, notably that its extreme fluctuations can be managed by using swap agreements and that it tended towards divergences during the crisis era..

This paper examines how inflation expectations of Chinese consumers and professional forecasters are affected by media sentiments based on the epidemiological foundations of the sticky information model. Rather than assuming professional forecasts are identical to newspaper forecasts, we assume news media are a common source for the transmission of typical people's inflation expectations. We collect media data from 30 leading newspapers and magazines in China and code news reports into three types of inflation: rising, falling, and unchanged. More importantly, we categorize the media pool into comprehensive, economic, and politically oriented media sources. We find a fundamental connection between news media and inflation expectations. However, there are significantly different impacts of news reports in different media sources on expectations. The difference is mainly concentrated in politically oriented media sources, and may be a reflection of China's unique media administration system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the real candidates for foreign vertical integration are those firms that have a large share of their inputs provided by headquarters. Firms engaged in foreign vertical integration are more capital and skill-intensive than those exclusively dedicated to foreign outsourcing. The degree of foreign vertical integration also matters since the most intensively integrated firms are also the most productive.

The central question is whether equilibrium marriage outcomes are stable matchings when search frictions are small. The answer is they can but need not be. For any stable matching there is an equilibrium leading to it almost surely. However there may also be equilibria leading to an unstable matching almost surely. A restriction to simpler strategies or to markets with aligned preferences rules out such equilibria. However unstable even Pareto-dominated matchings may still arise with positive probability under those two restrictions combined. In addition, inefficiency due to delay may remain significant despite vanishing search frictions. Finally, a condition is identified under which all equilibria are outcome equivalent, stable, and efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to compare (benchmark) the Nordic countries with a relevant group of rich OECD countries and calculate input efficiency scores for each country. We estimate a wide range of specifications in order to analyse different aspects of efficiency. In purely quantitative models (where inputs and outputs are expenditure and number of students at different levels of the educational system) and in models where graduation or completion rates are included as indicators of output quality, Finland is the most efficient Nordic country (often fully efficient), whereas Sweden and especially Norway and Denmark are clearly inefficient. However, using PISA test scores as indicators of student input quality in upper secondary education reduces the inefficiencies of these three countries. Also, when expected earnings after completed education are used as an indicator of output quality, all Nordic countries are estimated to be fully efficient (or nearly so). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Much variation in revenues among Norwegian local governments can be explained by revenues collected from hydropower production. This revenue variation, combined with good data availability, can be used to address a main concern in the resource curse literature; that public sector revenue, and in particular the revenue from natural resources, is endogenous. We obtain an exogenous measure of local revenue by instrumenting the variation in hydropower revenue, and thus total revenue, by topology, average precipitation and meters of river in steep terrain. We find support for what we term the Paradox of Plenty hypothesis that higher local government revenue reduces the efficiency in production of public goods.

The stakes have never been greater. Talks between international socio-environment groups, public-private dam partners, and Mekong countries are increasingly fractious and dysfunctional. The departure of the multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, from large-scale infrastructure funding has allowed the private sector access to investment opportunities in hydropower, and as a result facilitated the promise of rapid hydropower growth in the Lao PDR. The antagonism of international social and environmental groups towards these dams is due primarily to the transboundary impacts of multiple constructions and modifications to the Mekong. We posit that the dilemma in the negotiations over the Mekong dams in Lao can be best understood from the perspective of misaligned incentives-objectives. We examine the major stakeholders involved in contractual negotiations and group parties according to their aligned incentives-objectives. We employ a criteria trade-off framework to show that if talks take place over two rounds under particular rules, compromises of objectives and trading of incentives are possible. We stipulate that a Pareto-optimal solution is indeed possibleif a non-partisan, authoritative agent with retributory powers to design and enforce corrective incentives for all stakeholders takes part in both negotiation rounds.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Chareunsy, AK (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",andrea.chareunsy@mq.edu.au,,"Chareunsy, Andrea K./0000-0001-5941-1179",,,,,31,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Within nonmultinationals, exporters exhibit higher earning yields and returns than firms selling only in their domestic market. To explain this pattern, we develop a real option value model where firms are heterogeneous in productivity and have to decide whether and how to sell in a foreign market where demand is risky. Selling abroad is a source of risk exposure to firms: following a negative shock, they are reluctant to exit the foreign market because they would forgo the sunk cost they paid to enter. Multinational firms are the most exposed because of the higher costs they have to pay to invest. The calibrated model is able to match both aggregate U.S. export and foreign direct investment data, and the observed cross-sectional differences in earning yields and returns.","[Fillat, Jose L.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Boston University,"Fillat, JL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",,,,,,,,56,46,57,4,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about what households like about these energy products. We report on preferences for biomass-burning ICS attributes in a large sample of 2120 rural households in north India, a global hotspot for biomass fuel use and the damages that such use entails. Households have a strong baseline reliance and preference for traditional stoves, a preference that outweighs the $10 and $5 willingness to pay (WTP) for realistic (33%) reductions in smoke emissions and fuel needs on average, respectively. Preferences for stove attributes are also highly varied, and correlated with a number of household characteristics (e.g. expenditures, gender of household head, patience and risk preferences). These results suggest that households exhibit cautious interest in some aspects of ICS, but that widespread adoption is unlikely because many households appear to prefer traditional stoves over ICS with similar characteristics. The policy community must therefore support a reinvigorated supply chain with complementary infrastructure investments, foster experimentation with products, encourage continued applied research and knowledge generation, and provide appropriate incentives to consumers, if ICS distribution is to be scaled up.

This paper sheds light on tax incidence as well as the efficiency issue, the potential for welfare improving reform, by studying the impact of value added taxes (VAT) on prices and quantities of labor intensive services. I utilize a VAT reform targeted at a specific service sector, which creates a natural experiment set up. The VAT for hairdressing services in Finland was reduced from 22% to 8%, and the previous tax treatment still applied to other labor intensive services. The choice of the treatment and control groups was exogenous to circumstances in Finland, since these groups were selected from a wider European setting. The results suggest that hairdressers cut their prices only by half of what a complete pass-through would have implied, and that there was hardly any adjustment in equilibrium quantity due to the reform. Hairdressers were able to increase their profits significantly. There is important heterogeneity in the results according to firm size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the gravity model based on panel data on China's ODI and trade to 174 countries and regions during 2003-2012, the present paper investigates the impacts of China's ODI on exports. We find that China's ODI to a host country significantly promotes China's trade with that economy: a 10-percent increase in ODI stock can lead to a 2.14-percent increase in exports, a 2.07-percent increase in imports and a 2.87-percent increase in net exports. The scale of the host country's economy, its infrastructure and its distance to China also have significant impacts on China's exports. Therefore, growth in ODI will facilitate China's trade and integration into the global economy, and enhance industrial upgrading in China by transferring the low-end industries abroad.","[Liu, Xiaoguang] Renmin Univ China, Natl Acad Dev & Strategy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gou, Qin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Feng] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance & Economics; Peking University,"Gou, Q (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuxiaoguang@pku.edu.cn; twinsgou@gmail.com; fenglu@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,"Gou, Qin/0000-0002-2632-3786",Chinese Ministry of Education [14JZD016]; School of Finance in Central Universtiy of Finance and Economics,"Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); School of Finance in Central Universtiy of Finance and Economics","Xiaoguang Liu, Assistant Professor, National Academy of Development and Strategy, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China.

From age 45 socioeconomic gradients emerge risk tolerance continues to drop for the most disadvantaged and stabilizes for all other groups and reach a maximum of 0.5 SD by age 65.

We adapt Andreoni's theory of warm-glow impure altruism to account for how altruism motives respond differently depending on the disposition of the person and the situation. The model explains both positive spillovers (moral cleansing) and negative spillovers (moral licensing) for beha-vioral interventions, showing that targeting of informational campaigns depends on the complementarity between people's traits and the intervention's content. More importantly, the design of economic incentives (like Pigouvian taxes) to shift economic behavior should depend on both the distribution of social preferences in the population and the use of behavioral interventions.","[Ho, Benjamin] Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA; [Bao, Jiayi] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Vassar College; University of Pennsylvania,"Ho, B (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA.",jiayibao@wharton.upenn.edu; beho@vassar.edu,"; Bao, Jiayi/R-4923-2016","Ho, Benjamin/0000-0001-9728-6444; Bao, Jiayi/0000-0002-4071-9007","Noah Barnhart, Jr. Fund","Noah Barnhart, Jr. Fund","We thank seminar and conference participants at Harvard and Vassar for their helpful comments, as well as funding from the Mr. and Mrs. Noah Barnhart, Jr. Fund.

Using the U.S. and the unique Euro area surveys, we find that the credit channel amplifies a monetary policy shock on GDP and prices through the balance-sheets of households, firms and banks. For corporate loans, amplification is highest through the bank lending and the borrower's balance sheet channel; for households, demand is the strongest channel. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

(2) Real-demand shocks are the most important source of real-exchange-rate fluctuations. (3) Current account is usually influenced by all types of shocks, with technology shocks playing a stronger role. In particular, technology shocks play a prominent role in the existing global imbalance (the large external deficit of the United States).

The test against spurious long memory by Qu (2011) is consistent in this case as the standard local Whittle estimator for unknown d is upward biased. As demonstrated in this work, the power can be improved by removing the fractional component from the series prior to application of the test. This task can be accomplished by using the modified local Whittle approach by Hou and Perron (2014). This estimator is robust against contaminations and yields nearly unbiased point estimates of d, irrespective of whether contaminations are present or not. The suggested testing procedure has similar size properties as the original test and is often more powerful. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that two mothers entered employment for every ten additional children enrolled in public childcare. The effect is driven by mothers 30 years old and older and those with two children or more. While our estimates compare to those found earlier, they cannot be explained by a crowding out of alternative childcare modes.

We take advantage of the discontinuity in smoking habits introduced by the Italian smoking ban in 2005. Our estimates indicate that the ban reduced smoking intensity by half a cigarette per day and smoking participation rate by 2 percentage points. We estimate a significant effect on body weight of about 1 kg. Heterogeneous effects are also found, highlighting a smaller impact on men, employees and overweight and obese people. Most of the weight variations are attributed to quitting smoking, whereas reductions in cigarette consumption are not significant.","[Pieroni, L.; Salmasi, L.] Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Pieroni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",,,"Pieroni, Luca/0000-0003-1841-4351; Salmasi, Luca/0000-0001-6674-9215",ESRC-TSB-BIS-NESTA [ES/J008427/1]; ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC-TSB-BIS-NESTA; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Thanks for helpful comments to Christopher Boyce, Matias Ramirez, Rose Cairns, Ben Martin, Paul Nightingale, Tommaso Ciarli, Ohid Yaqub, Satoko Yasuda and two anonymous referees.

The economy, which consists of many industries and heterogeneous households whose preferences differ with respect to the value of leisure, experiences both supply and demand shocks. The central bank has private information regarding these shocks. Under a transparent regime within which the central bank releases its forecasts of its policy instruments, the optimal policy keeps the wedges between marginal rate of substitution and marginal rate of transformation constant across the states. This is not necessarily the case for the opaque regime where the central bank does not release its policy instrument forecasts. We first show that for any policy under the transparent regime there exists a policy under the opaque regime that delivers the same allocation. In other words, in general the opaque regime delivers a higher level of welfare. We next demonstrate that for a certain class of utility functions publication of central bank forecasts does not matter for optimal monetary policy. In other words, with or without publication of forecasts, the central bank's optimal policy would result in the same allocation of resources and the same level of welfare.","[Rhee, Hyuk Jae; Turdaliev, Nurlan] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",University of Windsor,"Turdaliev, N (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",jayrhee@uwindsor.ca; nurlan@uwindsor.ca,,"Turdaliev, Nurlan/0000-0002-0218-1795",,,,,34,0,0,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

In our trade model, one sector (agriculture) is perfectly competitive whilst the other (manufacturing) is monopolistically competitive. Both industries use skilled and unskilled labour as inputs. Entry into manufacturing requires a fixed cost in terms of skilled labour only. A rise in the market price for the differentiated goods raises both marginal revenue and the price of skilled labour, which affects the marginal cost of production and the entry cost. When short-run profits increase so that new manufacturing firms enter, fewer skilled workers are available for production purposes. This in turn may then lead to a decline in total manufacturing output. Our theoretical mechanism is jointly consistent with recent empirical observations on premature de-industrialization characterizing several Latin American and Asian countries and productive diversification as observed in various developing economies.","[Schweinberger, Albert G.] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Suedekum, Jens] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Konstanz; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,,suedekum@dice.hhu.de,,,German National Science Foundation [DFG-SU 413/2-1],German National Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),German National Science Foundation (DFG-SU 413/2-1) to J.S.,,34,1,2,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Preserving this joint foundation, however, imposes a discipline on the specification of models with variable capital utilization. In this note we show that conventional specifications of the depreciation cost of capital utilization and the labor supply elasticity, introduced into business cycle theory to generate a satisfactory amplification of shocks, entail counterfactual growth dynamics: the positive association between capital stock and GDP along the growth path turns negative. Across economies with access to the same technology, the economy with the lowest capital stock per capita is predicted to produce the highest output per capita. We compute lower and upper bounds for the involved elasticities between which these counterfactual dynamics are avoided.","[Strulik, Holger; Trimborn, Timo] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Trimborn, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",timo.trimborn@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412; Trimborn, Timo/0000-0001-8749-7176",,,,,29,2,2,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We first describe modern retailing, highlighting the role of modern formats, scale (often transcending national boundaries), and increased coordination with upstream and downstream partners in production and distribution. In developed markets, the transition to modern retailing is nearly complete. In contrast, many low-income and emerging markets continue to rely on traditional retail formats, that is, a collection of independent stores and open air markets supplied by small-scale wholesalers, although modern retail has begun to spread to these markets as well. E-commerce is a notable exception: the penetration of e-commerce in China and several developing nations in Asia has already surpassed that of high-income countries for some types of consumer goods. To understand the forces governing the adoption of modern technology and the unique role of e-commerce, we propose a framework that emphasizes the importance of scale and coordination in facilitating the transition from traditional to modern retailing. We conclude with some conjectures regarding the likely impact of increased retail modernization for the developing world.","[Bronnenberg, Bart J.] Tilburg Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Mkt, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bronnenberg, Bart J.] Tilburg Univ, Sch Econ & Management, CentER Res, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bronnenberg, Bart J.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England; [Ellickson, Paul B.] Univ Rochester, Simon Business Sch, Mkt & Econ, Rochester, NY USA",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Rochester,"Bronnenberg, BJ (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Mkt, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",bart.bronnenberg@tilburguniversity.edu; paul.ellickson@simon.rochester.edu,"Bronnenberg, Bart/AAS-2684-2021","Bronnenberg, Bart J./0000-0003-2947-5192",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We thank Emek Basker, Marnik Dekimpe, Bryan Ellickson, Katrijn Gielens, Els Gijsbrechts, Gordon Hanson, Enrico Moretti, and Timothy Taylor for helpful comments and suggestions.

Most of the variation in preferences for school quality across socio-economic groups arises from differences in the quality of accessible schools rather than differences in parents' preferences, although more advantaged parents have stronger preferences for academic performance.","Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Bristol; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge,"Burgess, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Market Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TX, Avon, England.",simon.burgess@bristol.ac.uk,,"Greaves, Ellen/0000-0002-2124-2645; Burgess, Simon/0000-0001-7206-3674; Wilson, Deborah/0000-0003-0573-9034","ESRC [RES-000-22-2843]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1, ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Many thanks to Jon Johnson, Senior Database Manager at the Centre for Longitudinal Studies for providing access and guidance for using secure data from the Millennium Cohort Study, and to Kirstine Hansen, Research Director of the Millennium Cohort Study for her support.

Benefits arise from increased execution-priority, while costs are due to adverse market impact. We analyze a structural model of optimal order placement that captures trade-off between the costs and benefits of order display. For a benchmark model of pure liquidity competition, we give a closed-form solution for optimal display sizes. We show that competition in liquidity supply incentivizes the use of hidden orders to prevent losses due to over-bidding. Thus, because aggressive liquidity competition is more prevalent in liquid stocks, our model predicts that the proportion of hidden liquidity is higher in liquid markets. Our theoretical considerations ares supported by an empirical analysis using high-frequency order-message data from NASDAQ We Find that there are no benefits in hiding orders in il-liquid stocks, whereas the performance gains can be significant in liquid stocks.

Results obtained indicate the significant two days pre-CNY and one day post-CNY holiday effects. Results also showed that post-CNY is found to be more volatile than the pre-CNY. Besides, the study found evidence of asymmetrical market reactions towards positive and negative news. The CNY holiday effects can be explained with the arguments drawn from behavioral finance, where the Chinese superstition and tradition cultures can alter investors' attitudes toward risk and affect investors' decision making in stock trading.","[Chia, Ricky Chee Jiun; Lim, Shiok Ye; Ong, Pui Khuan; Teh, Siew Fong] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Chia, RCJ (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.",ricky_chia82@hotmail.com,"Chia, Ricky Chee Jiun/J-5923-2019","Chia, Ricky Chee Jiun/0000-0002-0486-6325",,,,,38,4,5,1,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Keynes's produced a general theory by imposing fewer restrictive axioms than classical theory. Keynes's explicitly attacked the classical theory's axiom that an actuarially certain knowledge regarding the future is available to decision makers; thus Keynes's analysis rejects the ergodic hypothesis. Keynes's theory does not substitute the assumption that all economic activity must be nonergodic. Keynes's theory simply permits an analysis where the payout for some economic decisions (e.g., animal spirits investment spending) are made under uncertainty, i.e., without actuarial knowledge of the future payout of such spending decisions. O'Donnell's epistemological approach implicitly supports the laissez faire view that there should not be any government interference with operation of free product and financial markets for government interference policies may only worsen future outcomes in a world where humans including Keynes, economists, and government officials do not have the capability to understand how the economy works.",,,,,,,,,,,15,9,9,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This was considered irrational by heterodox economists on the grounds that it would harm employment and output. Politicians influenced by this tradition advocated a plan B. Experience has shown that the Coalition government's policy was not irrational. Employment reached record heights and economic growth resumed. The paper draws attention to the implications of these facts for heterodox economics and economic policy.

Chief among these are the empirical role of vacancies in the recruitment process; the amplitude, comovement, and persistence of cyclical unemployment-vacancy dynamics; and the sources of lateral shifts in the Beveridge curve. The synthesis of these themes identifies several priorities for ongoing research, including the role of entry costs into vacancy creation in shaping Beveridge dynamics; the cyclicality of search intensity, both off and on the job, and its relation to participation and job-to-job transitions; the theory and measurement of mismatch; and the sources of hysteresis in unemployment flows.","[Elsby, Michael W.

Much of the entrepreneurship research literature has built upon insights of economists such as Schumpeter, Knight, and Kirzner, each of whom has inspired a distinct strand of entrepreneurship theory and application. Schumpeterian innovation and Kirznerian alertness are the best-known concepts of entrepreneurship, but a newer research stream is building on Knight's idea of entrepreneurship as judgmental decision-making under uncertainty. What we call the judgment-based view models entrepreneurs as owning, controlling, and combining heterogeneous assets, which differ in their attributes, and deploying these assets within a firm to produce goods and services in anticipation of economic profit. This Forum presents three papers that develop, extend, and challenge the judgment-based view of entrepreneurship, focusing on the foundations of judgment, the processes of entrepreneurial resource assembly, and the relationship between the judgment-based view and other theories of economic organization.","[Foss, Nicolai J.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Foss, Nicolai J.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Strategy & Management, Bergen, Norway; [Klein, Peter G.] Univ Missouri, Div Appl Social Sci, Columbia, MO USA; [Klein, Peter G.] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Strategy & Management, Bergen, Norway",Copenhagen Business School; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Foss, NJ (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, Copenhagen, Denmark.",njf.smg@cbs.dk; pklein@missouri.edu,"Klein, Peter/JOZ-8851-2023",,,,,,75,54,60,7,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Finally, we argue that a satisfactory account of institutions must be compatible with different theories of normativity, specifying the social and psychological mechanisms that make it possible to override selfish desires.","[Hindriks, Frank] Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Groningen, Netherlands; [Guala, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Studies, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Groningen; University of Milan,"Guala, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Studies, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",francesco.guala@unimi.it,"Guala, Francesco/B-6425-2015","Hindriks, Frank/0000-0002-5818-4071",,,,,27,10,10,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This transition defined the career of Wisconsin's Harold M. Groves (1897-1969). Groves was a notable public finance economist, leading textbook author, and drafter of significant tax and labor legislation. He represented the culmination of a multigenerational institutionalist tradition. In this paper, I examine Groves and postwar public finance as a test case for the legacy of Wisconsin institutionalism. To that end, I consider Groves's contributions to postwar tax policy, his interactions with Henry C. Simons and Richard M. Musgrave, and his view on Keynesian public finance. I identify some Wisconsin institutionalist contributions to modern public finance and offer an explanation for the postwar decline in institutional public finance.","[Johnson, Marianne] Univ Wisconsin Oshkosh, Econ, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Oshkosh,"Johnson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Oshkosh, Econ, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",,"Johnson, Marianne/CAF-5068-2022",,,,,,67,6,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Many researchers have focused on various issues concerning sprawl, especially on the unintended consequences that new development has had for municipal finances, neighborhood income and residential segregation, and transportation planning, among other issues. Over the last decade, a new area in the literature on sprawl has focused on how the built environment of residential areas can impact health and emergency services. We contribute to this latest set of papers on sprawl by trying to empirically estimate the impact of sprawl in metropolitan regions on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) spending on public assistance. This assistance encompasses spending on debris removal, emergency protective measures, and rehabilitating or rebuilding of infrastructure, public buildings, public utilities, parks and recreational areas, in post-disaster relief efforts. In our exploratory analysis, the results indicate that urban sprawl is a factor in influencing the level of FEMA's public assistance spending.","[Lambert, Thomas E.] No Kentucky Univ, Publ Adm, Highland Hts, KY 41076 USA; [Catchen, James] No Kentucky Univ, Highland Hts, KY 41076 USA; [Vogelgesang, Victoria] St Ursula Acad, Cincinnati, OH USA",Northern Kentucky University; Northern Kentucky University,"Lambert, TE (通讯作者)，No Kentucky Univ, Publ Adm, Highland Hts, KY 41076 USA.",,"Lambert, Thomas E./ABH-7187-2020",,Dean's Office at the College of Arts and Sciences at Northern Kentucky University,Dean's Office at the College of Arts and Sciences at Northern Kentucky University,"Thomas E.

In addition, we assume that the social planner also has some doubts on the payoffs of the outcomes and thus wants his prediction to be robust when these payoffs are close but not exactly equal to those in the initial model. Under this local payoff uncertainty, the present paper establishes the following full characterization result for finite mechanisms: a social choice function is continuously implementable if and only if it is fully implementable in rationalizable strategies.

Using pairs of a parent and child, the experimental design varies the food prices of healthier and unhealthier alternatives of food products for children as part of specific food fiscal policies. We then examine the interplay of children's pester power as well as information about the fiscal policies. The results from our lab experiment suggest that (a) implementing a fat tax and a subsidy simultaneously can shift parental behavior to healthier food products to a greater degree than a fat tax or a subsidy alone, (b) providing information regarding the food fiscal policies can further increase the impact of the intervention, and (c) child pestering is one of the causes of the moderate effectiveness of the policies as it strongly affects parents in making unhealthier choices.

Using daily price data for over 11,000 retail gasoline stations, I find that prices fall more slowly than they rise as a consequence of firms extracting informational rents from consumers with positive search costs. Premium gasoline prices are shown to fall more slowly than regular fuel prices, which supports theories based upon competition with consumer search. Further testing also rejects focal price collusion as an important determinant of asymmetric pricing.

Labour is also positively linked to economic growth. The vector error correction model Granger causality results divulge that financial development causes real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and resultantly, real per capita GDP growth causes financial development in a Granger sense. The results also show that trade and labour Granger cause economic growth. The findings of the paper provide insights for policymakers to use financial development and trade openness as a tool for sustained economic growth in the long run.

These two countries operated under a common monetary regime until 1999 and followed two different monetary regimes thereafter: unilateral euroisation in Montenegro and monetary independence in Serbia. A stochastic frontier approach incorporating bank-specific and country-related variables is used to analyze cost efficiency in the banking sectors of Serbia and Montenegro. The analysis shows that a bank operating at given conditions in terms of ownership, market and other specific characteristics presents significantly higher cost efficiency if it operates in Montenegro rather than in Serbia. We argue that this result may relate to the choice of unilateral euroisation made by Montenegro. It is also shown that foreign-owned banks, higher capitalized banks and banks with lower non-performing loans operate at higher cost efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Online reputation, however, is not directly connected to a person, but only to the virtual identity of that person. Users can therefore shed a negative reputation by creating a new account. We study the effects of such identity changes on the efficiency of reputation systems. We compare two markets in which we exogenously vary whether sellers can erase their rating profile and start over as new sellers. Buyer trust and seller trustworthiness decrease significantly when sellers can erase their ratings. With identity changes, trust is particularly low towards new sellers since buyers cannot discriminate between truly new sellers and opportunistic sellers who changed their identity. Nevertheless, we observe positive returns on buyer investment under the reputation system with identity changes, and our evidence suggests that trustworthiness is higher than in the complete absence of a reputation system.","[Wibral, Matthias] Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Wibral, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",wibral@uni-bonn.de,"Wibral, Matthias/GLQ-8965-2022","Wibral, Matthias/0000-0002-7643-2841","German Research Foundation [KR 2077/2-1, SFB/TR 15]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author would like to thank Johannes Abeler, Steffen Altmann, Christine Harbring and Armin Falk for many insightful discussions and Markus Antony, Holger Gerhardt, Alexander Koch, Sebastian Kube, Rosemarie Nagel, Axel Ockenfels, Gert Ponitzsch, Mirko Seithe, Dirk Sliwka, Florian Zimmermann and seminar and conference participants at Alicante, Amsterdam, Bonn, Cologne, Graz, Milan and Zurich for helpful comments.

The results indicate that the total CEE and the CEE of 17 provinces, including all eastern provinces, decreased between 2007 and 2010. The largest decrease in total CEE is caused by an input structural effect, which decreases the CEE of most of the provinces. The technique effect arising from changes in provincial carbon intensities causes the second largest decrease in total CEE and it effectively reduces the CEE of most of the provinces, especially the eastern provinces. Changes in the export composition of most of the provinces also decrease the provincial CEE. A change in the provincial distribution of exports decreases the CEE in 11 provinces on the one hand and increases the CEE in 19 provinces on the other hand. A change in export volume increases the CEE of each province and the whole country, but its total effect is evidently lower than the input structural effect and the technique effect.

On the other hand, the complexity of general equilibrium OLG modelling necessitates some simplifications in the model. We run a series of experiments in which the same reform in the same economy is modelled with six different sets of assumptions concerning the functional form of the utility function, time inconsistency, bequests' redistribution, labour supply decisions and internalization of the linkage between social security contributions and benefits in these decisions as well as public spending. We find that these assumptions significantly affect both the size and the sign of the macroeconomic and welfare measures of the policy effects with the order of magnitude comparable to the reform itself.

As recently as 1990 Japan had the youngest population among the Group of 6 large, developed countries. However, the combined effects of aging of the baby-boomer generation and low fertility rates have produced very rapid aging. Japan now finds itself with the oldest population among the Group of 6 and its population will continue to age at a rapid pace in future years. Aging is already placing a burden on government finances and Japan's ability to confront the negative fiscal implications of future aging is constrained by its very high debt-GDP ratio.

Our conjecture is that governments will usually find it more attractive to pursue fiscal adjustments in a situation of relatively high growth, but based on a simple stylized model of government behavior, the expectation is that mainly high-trust governments will be in a position to defer consolidation to years with higher growth. Overall, our analysis of a panel of European countries provides support for this expectation. The difference in fiscal policies depending on government trust levels may help explaining why better governed countries have been found to have less severe business cycles. It suggests that trust and credibility play an important role not only in monetary policy, but also in fiscal policy.","[Bursian, Dirk; Zimmer, Jochen] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Weichenrieder, Alfons J.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Goethe University Frankfurt; Vienna University of Economics & Business; Ifo Institut,"Weichenrieder, AJ (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",dirk.bursian@bundesbank.de; a.weichenrieder@em.uni-frankfurt.de; jochen.zimmer@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,28,7,8,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The literature we review shows that high GDP growth has been achieved through factor accumulation rather than productivity increase, a strategy of extensive growth that has now run into diminishing returns as well as political, social and resource constraints. Prolonged heavy dependence on imports of foreign labor and skills to attract foreign investment has contributed to low, declining and even negative productivity growth, with low real GDP growth in recent years. In response, the government is pursuing renewed economic restructuring, limiting foreign labor inflows, targeting investments more selectively, and promoting productivity and innovation, so far with uncertain results. This paper suggests that Singapore should let market forces propel the economy toward services, domestic consumption and regional trade, led by domestic private enterprise.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are shown to complement each other rather than be competitors. The income gains of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies as a whole account for 1.2% of regional GDP by the TPP, 2.1% by the RCEP, and 4.3% by the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). Meanwhile, larger economic benefits are expected from NTMs reductions in addition to tariff removals.

The gap widens with surpluses of the German trade balance to other euro area countries and becomes negative, when surpluses of the trade balance contract. This phenomenon is accompanied by a new pattern of money growth, which is not driven by domestic credit of banks any more but by their net foreign assets. German nonfinancial corporations have rising equity ratios and provide other sectors with funds on a net basis. Moreover, their deposits with German banks have grown at a much stronger pace than their loans. We suspect that German membership in the European monetary union is an important explanation of the changing behavior in the real and financial sector and show the substitution between export cash-flows and domestic credit theoretically in a two-country model of post-Keynesian type, in which the two countries use a common currency.

If two countries are identical in size, then under free trade in labor services, all workers work only in their local daytime, and night shift in each country is performed by imported labor services supplied by residents of the other country in their local daytime. Night-time wage becomes the same as daytime wage (a wage equalization result). Other factor prices are also equalized. In both countries, capital rental rate increases, while land rent decreases. However, if two countries are different in size, trade in labor services does not equalize wages: in the large country, wages for night-shift workers are higher than daytime wages and some residents work at night; in the small country, daytime wages become higher than night-time wages and no one works at night, and night-shift work is done by imported labor services from the large country. Land rent in the small country decreases. Land rent in the large country may or may not decrease, but it is always higher than in the small country. Capital rental rates in both countries are equalized and increase.","[Nakanishi, Noritsugu] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Ngo Van Long] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",Kobe University; McGill University,"Nakanishi, N (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, Rokkodai Cho 2-1, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",nakanishi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp; ngo.long@mcgill.ca,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22243024]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243024] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Nakanishi: Graduate School of Economics, Kobe University, Rokkodai-cho 2-1, Nada-ku, Kobe 657-8501, Japan.

The findings show that, assuming real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China of about 7% a year, the value of Latin American exports to China (at 2005 prices) can be expected to increase by an average of about 10% a year between 2014 and 2019.

Second, with no hiring subsidies, the introduction of a firing tax for the newly hired always increase the welfare of employed while its impact on the welfare of unemployed depends on the returns to training.

This paper provides empirical evidence to inform discussions on possible educational interventions to make children more forward-looking or less present-biased, by putting forward a way to identify self-control problems in children and exploring the role of commitment devices in mitigating such problems. We report results from an experiment that measures planned allocations, the demand for a commitment device, and actual choices in the context of chocolate consumption over two days. The experiment is conducted as part of a large field study on children's preferences, which allows us to correlate behavior with variables related to the subjects' socio-economic background and educational environment, as well as preference parameters elicited through other tasks and surveys. We find a large demand for commitment among children. In addition, we identify important correlations between patience, commitment demand and time inconsistency, as well as student-specific personality traits and outcomes such as school success.

I find that the effect disappears completely when a multiple price list instrument is used instead of a convex time budget design. Alternatively, the effect is reduced by half when sooner and later payment risks are realized using a single lottery instead of two independent lotteries. The result is thus at least partially driven by intertemporal diversification, supporting an explanation in terms of concavity of the intertemporal, and not only atemporal, utility function.

I find that immigration does not affect the wages of competing natives, but induces adverse employment effects. This finding is consistent with a wage structure that is rigid in France. The quality of the data allows to dig more deeply into the interpretation of the immigration impact. First, I show that immigrants displace native workers because they are more willing to work at lower wages due to lower outside options. Second, I find that natives on short-term contracts, who are less subject to wage rigidities, do experience wage losses due to immigration.","[Edo, Anthony] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Edo, Anthony] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Edo, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",anthony.edo@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,109,8,10,0,31,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The PMH model has hidden actions, while the HMH model has hidden information in addition to hidden actions. In both models, agents are risk averse and principals are risk neutral. The article derives the equilibrium restrictions from the optimal contract and uses the restrictions to show that the models have empirical content. For any given risk-aversion parameter, the models' other parameters are non-parametrically point identified. The risk-aversion parameter-and hence the model-are, however, only partially identified. Management's ability to manipulate accounting reports arises endogenously within HMH models, but not in all versions of PMH models. We use our framework to investigate whether shareholders contract with management recognizing that accounting reports are susceptible to manipulation and, therefore, endogenous to the incentives offered to management. The data reject all models in which accounting reports are verifiable. Furthermore, the version of the PMH in which accounting reports can be manipulated is rejected if expected compensation is restricted to be positive.","[Gayle, George-Levi] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Miller, Robert A.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Carnegie Mellon University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation [SES0721098],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank two editors of this journal, four referees, Chen Li, Maher Said, Melissa Tartari, and Steve Tadelis for their comments.

This paper proposes an efficiency analysis approach that addresses which emission rates (and standards) would be feasible if the existing generating units adopt best practices. A new efficiency measure is introduced and further decomposed to identify different sources' contributions to emission rate improvements. Estimating two Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models - the well-known joint production model and the new materials balance model - on a dataset consisting of 160 bituminous-fired generating units, we find that the average generating unit's electricity-to-carbon dioxide ratio is 15.3% below the corresponding best-practice ratio. Further examinations reveal that this discrepancy can largely be attributed to non-discretionary factors and not to managerial inefficiency. Moreover, even if the best practice ratios could be implemented, the generating units would not be able to comply with the EPA's recently proposed carbon dioxide standard. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike existing studies that focus on information sharing among firms, we are interested in the information provided by firms' main bank. Specifically, using a unique data set containing information on both Japanese firms' export activities and the experience of their main bank (i.e., their top lender bank) in transacting with other exporting firms, we examine whether main banks act as a conduit of information on export markets. We find that information spillovers through main banks positively affect client firms' decision to start exporting (extensive margin), implying that information on foreign markets provided by banks substantially reduces the fixed entry cost of exporting. On the other hand, we do not find any evidence that information provided by banks has an effect on the export volume or on the growth rate of exports (intensive margin).

We estimate the border effect between Red and Blue states using the gravity equation with a nonlinear generalized method of moments estimator to simultaneously overcome the problems associated with endogeneity, cross-state price differences, and zero-trade flow. The border effect is robustly confirmed for the 2000s, while not so robustly detected for the 1990s. Notably, in 2007, the border reduces trade between Red and Blue states to approximately 75% of the trade within each set of states. This estimated border effect is much smaller than the United States-Canada national border effect estimated by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), and by Feenstra (2002), yet is comparable to the border effect that Nitsch and Wolf (2009) find for the former West and East Germanies approximately 10years after reunification. While the border effect in Germany after reunification is decreasing, the border effect between the Red and Blue states is emerging. We also find the border effect is more significant for consumption, rather than intermediate, goods. The border effect is an important indicator for a potential dismantling of the economic connectivity in the United States.

First, it is not clear when panics occurred because prior panic series differ in their identification of panic episodes. Second, establishing the direction of causality is tricky. This paper addresses these two problems (i) by deriving a new panic series for the 1825-1929 period and (ii) by studying the output effects of major banking panics via vector autoregression (VAR) and narrative-based methods.

Political influence can harm competence because it lowers the incentives of bureaucrats to invest in competence. Politicians then want to adopt institutions that insulate the bureaucracy because this establishes a commitment to reward competence. Political leaders insulate the bureaucracy if public good provision is important compared to rent extraction or when political competition forces the political elite to internalize the welfare loss caused by patronage. Through this channel political reforms can lead to reforms of the bureaucracy.

Using trade statistics of coal, oil and gas of 40 countries over the period of 1995 to 2008, we found that the efficiency of bilateral energy trade ranged between 0.26 and 035 when imperfect substitution between different energy products is taken into account This measure is significantly lower than those obtained from traditional gravity models. It suggests that the ability of cross-product substitution affects trade efficiency improvement which results from regional market integration and related trade policy. The results provide useful insights on predicting the pattern of future energy trade and hence have important implications for relevant countries to prioritize product-specific trade policies.

As a benchmark without learning it is shown that relaxing the usual assumption of imposed imitation yields additional strategic effects. Therefore, the leader's R&D effort increases with the gap as she is trying to avoid competition in the future. When firms gain experience by performing R&D technological leaders rest on their laurels allowing followers to catch up. Contrary to the benchmark case, the leader's innovation effort declines with the lead.

We formulate a simple model in which countries can close the gap with the technological leader, but where the cost of doing so may be so high that the country chooses to remain laggards. Observed disparities in productivity may be the result of a recognition that the cost of closing the gap exceeds benefit and there may therefore exist an international equilibrium in which there are leaders and followers. Even if it is granted that the United States is the leader and Scandinavia are followers, there are theoretical grounds for arguing that the Nordic model may in fact be better for innovation, suggesting that if the US adopted some of the Nordic institutions, innovations would be higher, and societal welfare would be improved even more.

We first provide an upper bound for the best performance we can guarantee among all feasible mechanisms. The bound is represented as the maximized value of the designer's objective subject to the inequality version of the standard envelope incentive conditions. We then prove the bound to be tight under certain conditions on the designer's prior over the agents' pay-off types in auction and bilateral-trade applications. In private-value auction and bilateral trade, the optimal mechanisms (a second-price auction and posted-price mechanism, respectively) satisfy dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, the classical notion of robust mechanisms. In an interdependent-value auction, we find that a second-price auction is optimal in revenue with interdependent values, which is neither dominant-strategy nor ex post incentive compatible, but satisfies the novel incentive compatibility introduced in this analysis.","Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Yamashita, T (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,,,Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research,Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research,"I am grateful to Ilya Segal, Matthew Jackson, Jonathan Levin, Paul Milgrom, Andrzej Skrzypacz, Stephen Morris, Dirk Bergemann, Gabriel Carroll, Koichi Tadenuma, Hideshi Itoh, Eve Ramaekers, Olivier Tercieux, Tilman Borgers, Philippe Jehiel, Jacques Cremer, Christian Hellwig, Thomas Mariotti, Jean Tirole, and seminar participants at Stanford University, Hitotsubashi University, Yokohama National University, Duke University, University of Rochester, Ecole Polytechnique, California Institute of Technology, Toulouse School of Economics, Boston University, University of California Davis, Paris School of Economics, University of Michigan, University of Copenhagen, and University of Glasgow for the valuable comments on various stages of the paper.

Although the link between the two has featured prominently in the literature, a causal effect has been difficult to pin down due to the endogeneity of these variables. We use plausibly exogenous variations in the incomes of countries' trading partners weighted by the level of trade flows, and international oil price shocks, as instruments for within-country variations in countries' real GDP per capita. Controlling for country and time fixed effects, our instrumental variables regressions show that increases in national income have a significant moderating effect on income inequality: a 1 % increase in real GDP per capita reduces the Gini coefficient by around 0.08 percentage points on average. We document that education is one possible channel that mediates this relationship, and explore the implications of our findings for the welfare effect of national income growth.","[Brueckner, Markus] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dabla Norris, Era] IMF, Washington, DC USA; [Gradstein, Mark] BGU, Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Queensland; International Monetary Fund; Ben Gurion University,"Gradstein, M (通讯作者)，BGU, Beer Sheva, Israel.",grade@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Vachadze, George/O-2680-2014",,,,,,46,22,25,3,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Examining corporate capital structure decisions in 12 European countries, we provide strong empirical evidence of employees' conservatism in capital structure choice. We find that employee-governed firms operate with significantly lower leverage and that employee-governed firms are significantly less levered at the same amount of earnings volatility than firms governed by other stakeholders. We also find evidence that employee-governed firms, at least in some countries, rely on internal resources to a larger extent. However, we did not find evidence that employee-governed firms have to pledge more collateral to obtain debt financing. In addition to this, we find evidence that employee-governed firms choose debt of shorter maturity and, somewhat surprisingly, that employee-governed firms in some countries are faced with lower cost of debt compared to firms governed by other stakeholders and not higher cost of debt as expected because of credit rationing and limited borrowing capacity.","[Crnigoj, Matjaz] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Crnigoj, Matjaz; Mramor, Dusan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Crnigoj, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",crnigojm@ier.si; dusan.mramor@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,25,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Even accounting for congestion externalities, a platform limits downloads more than would be welfare maximizing; indeed, by so much, that barring such practices can be welfare superior to what a platform would do.

The indicators are observed at various frequencies and are tied together by cointegration so that valuable high-frequency information is passed to low-frequency series through the common factors. Differencing the data breaks the cointegrating link among the series and some of the signal leaks out to the idiosyncratic components, which do not contribute to the transfer of information among indicators. We find that allowing for common trends improves forecasting performance over a stationary factor model based on differenced data. The common-trends factor model outperforms the stationary factor model at all analyzed forecast horizons.

The construction sector will play an essential part to bring the country on the path of economic growth, and competition within the sector is crucial to achieve this goal. In this paper, we analyse the effect of competition in public works tenders in the DRC, using a unique and newly assembled database on public works contracts. We find that the number of participating bidders significantly reduces contract prices, confirming our prior hypothesis that competitive pressure can enhance the overall performance of the sector. Further, we account for the possibility of heteregenous tender participants, finding that the competition effect can vary with the degree of bidders' heterogeneity.","[Jametti, Mario] Univ Lugano, Inst Econ IdEP, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Galletta, Sergio; Jametti, Mario; Redonda, Agustin] Univ Lugano, IdEP Inst, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Galletta, Sergio; Jametti, Mario; Redonda, Agustin] Swiss Publ Adm Network, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jametti, Mario] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Ifo Institut,"Jametti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Inst Econ IdEP, Via G Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",mario.jametti@usi.ch,,"Galletta, Sergio/0000-0002-2254-9147; Redonda, Agustin/0000-0002-2938-1711",Swiss National Science Foundation [Sinergia _ 147668],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We wish to thank Steve Koch, the editor, two anonymous referees and Johannes Herderschee for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the paper.

This result is shown differently by various authors. Mathias Binswanger pretends to establish the growth imperative of modern market economies by making the link between money creation and firms' profits. If Binswanger's strictly positive minimal steady state growth solution is binding, so is the minimal growth derived from the money creation rule but the reverse is not true. In other words, it is sufficient to consider the money creation rule for the feasible solutions in his model; the link between firms' profits and money creation is missing. Nevertheless, the basic message of his model is not discredited: there is a growth imperative in capitalist economies regardless of risk considerations.","Univ West Hungary, Fac Econ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Sopron, Hungary",,"Gilányi, Z (通讯作者)，Univ West Hungary, Fac Econ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Sopron, Hungary.",,,"Gilanyi, Zsolt/0000-0001-6853-834X",,,,,7,4,5,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Despite the fact that survey measures of inflation expectations have a similar central tendency, the amount of disagreement among different types of economic agents appears to be substantial and shows no clear relationship with relative price variability. The analysis of micro-level inflation expectations data suggests that inflation uncertainty measured by dispersion of households expectations relies not only on inflation regime but also on relative price variability. Each survey forecast has the ability to explain the path of future inflation, but surprisingly with the wrong direction from the rationality perspectives. Percentile regression analysis yields robust evidence of bounded rationality for the households.","[Jang, Byeongdeuk; Kim, Young Se] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, YS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",jbd1311@gmail.com; youngsekim@skku.edu,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

If the fact that conflict occurred at all also conveys information, the more feared party may attack. If they do not, the population view peace as a sign of weakness and switch loyalties anyway.

We treat amnesties as endogenous, resulting from a strategic game between many taxpayers discounting future payments from punishment and a government that balances costs and benefits of amnesty programs. From the model we derive hypotheses about the factors that should influence the occurrence of tax amnesties. To test these predictions empirically, we rely on amnesty information from US States between 1981 and 2011. In line with the theoretical model, our empirical findings suggest that the likelihood of amnesties is mainly driven by a government's fiscal requirements and the taxpayers' expectations on future amnesties.

In the major biodiesel source being palm oil, we seek to establish the impact of these policies on oil palm producer incomes, prices and production levels of crude palm oil (CPO) and biodiesel, as well as the impacts on demand for land for oil palm plantation expansion. We also calculate the so-called deadweight costs, to account for the social costs derived from the inefficiencies of government interventions in the biodiesel markets. The analysis is done using a partial equilibrium models for the two interrelated sectors, the production of palm oil and biodiesel, and the demand for new land needed to cope with the additional palm oil needed. The model was calibrated for 2009 to simulate for the 2010-2020 period. The results of the simulations reveal that the subsidies alone are themselves not effective tools to achieve the government objectives defined in the Biofuels Program in Colombia. Subsidies need to be complemented by increased blending mandates to ensure that palm cultivation and production of biodiesel investments are profitable enough that producers would bet on such business. Additionally, we find that producers of palm oil benefit most from subsidies in the short term; however, in the long-term it is the biodiesel entrepreneurs who will appropriate the larger share of growth revenue of the entire production chain. The social costs of the Biofuels Program are small in the short term, and represent only between 0.2% and 0.7% of the tax expenditure. However, in the long term they would become significant, and would account for around 4.1% to 6.1% of the tax payers' expense. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that, on average, solar generation negatively affects the solar source market value, causing a departure from the grid parity condition and mining their competitiveness once public incentives are removed. This negative relation is not constant over time and becomes stronger for increasing solar penetration in the energy mix. Interestingly, the opposite is found when looking at gas. While the relation between solar production and the gas market value is negative or not significant when the former is low, it turns positive for higher levels of solar production. This is the result of a change in gas producers' bidding strategies. Indeed, in the Italian power market the highest hourly price has shifted from the peak daytime, when solar production is concentrated, to the off-peak nighttime, when solar is absent from the market and gas can exploit temporary market power.

Actually, profit without investment-or rather, profit beyond investment-is in the very nature of capitalism. It is not a special case. The dividend channel is an essential component of profit formation. We show that its enabling condition, and what at the same time limits its width, is firms' resort to debt. Beyond a certain point, the divorce between dividends and investment is such that firms' policies leave their viable domain-a domain bounded by their wishes to be self-financing. Past that point, any increase in profits runs into a 'glass ceiling' in terms of outlets for those profits. It is when the demands of finance (i.e., of shareholders) reach this limit that the three regimes identified in the literature make their appearance, including the one called 'profit without investment'. Seen in this light, these regimes are therefore all cases of profit without investment, ones that take on some reality and some plausibility when finance tries to drag profit without accumulation outside of its viable domain.","[Cordonnier, Laurent; Van de Velde, Franck] Univ Lille 1, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Cordonnier, L (通讯作者)，USTL, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",Laurent.Cordonnier@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,33,12,14,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This territory, in which the tension among ethnic groups is still the focus of international concern, is one of the primary recipients of remittances in the world. Using data collected in 2011 from 8000 households residing in Kosovo and 650 of their members living abroad, we focus on differences in the remittance behaviors of Serbs and Albanians who were involved in a civil war in the 1990s. Our results show that the probability of receiving money is much higher for the Albanians compared to the Serbs, which is related to differences in migration models between both ethnic groups. Remittances lead to a significant increase in the average level of per capita consumption for all ethnic groups even after accounting for endogeneity of the transfer variable.

The derivatives in these markets can be characterized as trading products and hedging products. Each contract shows a clear increase in trading volume and liquidity when approaching maturity. We link this to a testable hypothesis where financial traders are compensated for holding price risk, and where the sign and magnitude of the risk premium changes depending on the hedging pattern of producers and retailers. Incorporating this in regressions we find that there are higher risk premiums in the period before the forwards become front products, compared to the risk premiums in the front period.

The results show that the total energy intensities of COEs in the industrial sector are generally 5%-35% higher than that of FlEs across industry groups. At an aggregate level, China could save up to 20.3% of its energy use, if industrial COEs could duplicate the energy use efficiency and production technology of FlEs.

J,"Ma, B",,,,"Ma, Ben",,,Does urbanization affect energy intensities across provinces in China?Long-run elasticities estimation using dynamic panels with heterogeneous slopes,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Urbanization; Energy intensity; Energy transition; Long-run elasticity; Heterogeneous estimators,CO2 EMISSIONS; CONSUMPTION; DEMAND; TRENDS; INDIA; INDUSTRIALIZATION; TRANSITIONS; IMPACTS; CITY,"Although there has been extensive debate in the literature that addresses the impact of urbanization on total energy use, the relative magnitude of each impact channel has not been empirically examined and urbanization's effects on energy transition dynamics in China remains unknown. Using panel datasets at the provincial level from 1986 to 2011, this paper employs dynamic models to investigate both the long-run and short-run elasticities of urbanization on energy intensities and the most significant impact channel is identified. Coal intensity and electricity intensity are also modeled to reveal energy transition dynamics driven by urbanization. A set of newly developed regression techniques, namely well-performed common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) and augmented mean group (AMG) estimators, are used to treat residual cross-sectional dependence, nonstationaty residuals, and unlikely-to-hold homogeneous slope assumptions. The results obtained verify that the net effects of urbanization on overall energy intensity and electricity intensity are statistically positive, with long-run elasticities of 0.14% to 0.37% and 023% to 0.29%, respectively, whereas China's urbanization does not significantly increase coal intensity. The fact that short-run elasticities account for a majority of corresponding long-run values indicates that the short-run effect that is, indirect energy use induced by urban infrastructures is the most significant impact channel of urbanization on energy use in China. An energy transition from high-pollution coal to clean electricity is also present in China, although the fundamental transition to renewable energy is still in its infancy. From a regional perspective, urbanization exerts asymmetric impacts on provincial energy use so that energy policies associated with urbanization should be province-specific The findings also illustrate that for a panel dataset on regional dimension within large and fast-growing economies such as China, error cross-sectional dependence and residual nonstationarity must be tested and properly treated to avoid size distortion and biased estimators.

Making early bids observable allows high-value bidders to signal their strength and deter others from entering the auction. Nonetheless, as long as the seller can commit to a reserve price, expected revenue is higher when bids are observable than when they are sealed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We show that disagreement in legislatures can lead to policy persistence that attenuates the temptation to overspend. Depending on the environment, legislators' decisions to be fiscally responsible may either complement or substitute other legislators' decisions. When legislators have low discount factors, their actions are strategic complements. Thus, changes of the political environment that induce fiscal responsibility are desirable as they generate a positive responsibility multiplier and reduce spending. However, when the discount factor is high, the same changes induce some legislators to free ride on others' responsibility which may lead to higher spending.","Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,,,,,Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047],Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank the editors and anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions.

It models the entry decisions of bands, the contracting decisions of record companies, the airplay decisions of radio stations and the radio listening and recording purchasing decisions of consumers. The paper shows that a local content quota leads, perversely, to the increased internationalization of domestic music.

Examples can be found in Spain, Belgium, Italy, Great Britain, and other countries. Regional governments may invest in cultural identity due to beneficial effects on social capital. However, this comes at the cost of cultural adaption costs for non-natives. We propose a simple model of regional culture investments in a federation to investigate such a tradeoff. The model shows that uncoordinated cultural policies generally lead to oversupply of regional culture, and that richer regions face higher incentives to invest in regional culture. We conclude that only mild assumptions are necessary to make a strong case for regional cultural integration. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (2) (2015) 323-333.

However, the effort an agent invests in his/her firm is difficult to measure. Golf handicaps enable us to look into the relationship between different degrees of ownership and their implications for the effort that agents exert. Handicaps have the advantage that they can be directly observed and can be viewed as a mirror image of a manager's effort. We expect that times of crisis and changes in management positions influence golf handicaps, mostly for owners and, to a lesser extent, for CEOs and chairmen. Data of 440 Swiss top managers and their handicaps during eight years, from 2003 to 2010, strongly support this assumption.","[Schoen, Constantin; Rost, Katja] Univ Zurich, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ehrmann, Thomas] Univ Munster, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Munster,"Schön, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",constantin.schoen@uzh.ch; 30theh@ism.uni-muenster.de; katja.rost@uzh.ch,"Rost, Katja/N-3420-2013","Rost, Katja/0000-0002-7752-7818; Schoen, Constantin/0000-0003-0480-8405",,,,,26,2,2,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2015,68,2,,,,,255,274,,10.1111/kykl.12083,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF4XH,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352556700007,0

We analyze how general equilibrium effects operating through the international capital market affect this Green Paradox. In a two-region, two-period world with identical homothetic preferences and without investment, the global interest rate falls and the Green Paradox weakens. With investment or a relatively more impatient oil-importing region, the Green Paradox may be strengthened because the future oil demand function shifts downward or because the interest rate rises. If the oil-importing region is very much more patient than the oil-exporting region, the Green Paradox may be reversed but in our calibrated model the effects are tiny. With exploration and endogenous initial oil reserves, a future carbon tax lowers cumulative oil extraction in partial equilibrium. If the boost to current oil extraction is weakened, strengthened or reversed in general equilibrium, so is the fall in cumulative extraction. A partial and general equilibrium welfare analysis of a future carbon tax, both for full and partial exhaustion, is given. The effects of stock-dependent extraction costs are separately discussed in an Appendix. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We indeed find high marginal returns to capital and sizable effects of household non-business wealth and, in contrast to previous studies, risk on capital accumulation in MEs.

This paper uses a large cross-country dataset on growth and changes in inequality to assess the importance of these changes in inequality for changes in social welfare. Changes in inequality are on average small, less volatile than growth, and uncorrelated with growth. This implies that most of the variation in changes in social welfare within countries over time is due to differences in average growth performance. Equivalently, the additional growth in average incomes required to compensate in terms of social welfare growth - for a typical increase in inequality is quite small. The main policy implication is the importance of overall economic growth for improvements in social welfare. Our work also suggests that it is difficult to find robust correlations between policy and institutional variables and changes in inequality, indicating that there is no simple recipe for enhancing equality. Furthermore, the fact that changes in equality are uncorrelated with economic growth means that there are likely to be some equality-enhancing policies that also promote growth, while others reduce growth. With growing pressure to do something about inequality, policymakers should avoid undermining growth in the quest for greater equality.","[Dollar, David] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; World Bank, Washington, DC USA",Brookings Institution; Yale University; The World Bank,"Dollar, D (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,Knowledge for Change Program of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change Program of the World Bank,"The authors would like to thank, without implication, Thorsten Beck, Marcelo Giugale, Sergei Guriev, Pete Lanjouw, and seminar participants at the World Bank, Yale University, American University and the 60th Economic Policy Panel Meeting for helpful comments.

We assume that agents, in addition to consumption and leisure, also derive utility from complying with social and personal norms such that deviations from norms induce psychological costs. An important contribution is that we allow for conflicting norms and we assume that the weight of these norms in the agent's utility is endogenous. We show that conflicting norm incentives may have long-run effects on labour supply: for example, the long-run effect of a wage increase on labour supply is reinforced if agents can adjust the weight attached to a given norm, and that women may be prevented from making a full transition from homemakers to breadwinners if such a transition make them outsiders in society.","[Mannberg, Andrea] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90181 Umea, Sweden; [Sjogren, Tomas] Umea Univ, SE-90181 Umea, Sweden; [Sjogren, Tomas] Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland",Umea University; Umea University; Abo Akademi University,"Mannberg, A (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90181 Umea, Sweden.",andrea.mannberg@econ.umu.se; tomas.sjogren@econ.umu.se,,,Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research; National Tax Board [RS10-1319:1]; Wallander-Hedelius Research Foundation [W2010-0368:1],Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); National Tax Board; Wallander-Hedelius Research Foundation,"Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research, the National Tax Board (RS10-1319:1), and the Wallander-Hedelius Research Foundation (W2010-0368:1).",,31,1,1,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Parties expect from rescheduling both recovery and growth, but reservation prices are key dimensions to consider in the analysis in order to assess the opportunity and to design the new financial set-up. For reservation price, the creditor may have in mind the liquidation value of the firm he can get by a strict enforcement of his contractual rights in court. The shareholder requires from rescheduling the recognition of her risky, specific and important (financial and intangible) involvements in the future. To shed light on rescheduling with reservation prices, we develop first a general parsimonious distribution-free structural framework. We derive sufficient conditions for rescheduling to take place and highlight situations where no rescheduling can occur. We characterize cases where rescheduling is for the creditor possible but sub-optimal. So the shareholder's reservation price can dramatically restrict the set of possible extensions and it does matter for the creditor. We then restrict our setting to undertake numerical analysis, our benchmark being the canonical rescheduling model of Longstaff (1990). Here, we can explore with simulations feasibility and optimality of rescheduling for different magnitudes of reservation prices and different firms' profiles. We finally investigate various concerns related to rescheduling such as agency costs, exit from no-rescheduling situations and bargaining between stakeholders. We also discuss different ways to lower the shareholder's reservation price. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A simple cost-benefit analysis shows that increasing the gratuity at release is a very efficient policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We study the effect of punishment on the reward and the investment decisions, when the effectiveness and cost of coordinated punishment depend on the number of investors adhering to this activity. The interaction takes place in an overlapping-generations model with heterogeneous preferences and incomplete information. The only long-run outcomes of the dynamics are either a fully cooperative culture (FCC) with high levels of trust and cooperation and fair returns or a non-cooperative culture with no cooperation at all. The basin of attraction of the FCC is larger; the higher the institutional capacity of coordinated punishment, the higher the level of peer pressure and the smaller the individual cost of coordinated punishment.","[Olcina, Gonzalo; Calabuig, Vicente] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Olcina, G (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain.",Gonzalo.Olcina@uv.es,"Calabuig, Vicente/L-7058-2014","Calabuig, Vicente/0000-0001-9088-8274","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [EC02008-06035/ECON, ECO2011-29230.]",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government),"The authors thank an associate editor and a referee for helpful comments.

We treat the religious service collectively consumed by the congregation as a participatory public good, in the sense that while its quality increases in contributions, individual consumption varies by the amount of time devoted toward attendance. The model predicts that lower income individuals will be over-represented in religious congregations, with giving concentrated among higher income members.

In this trend of academic commercialization, a growing concern has been expressed that its potential incompatibility with the traditional norms of open science could undermine the cooperative climate in academia. Drawing on the framework of evolution of the cooperation, this study examines the changing nature of academic cooperation under the current policy trend. In an ideal state of open science, academics are supposed to cooperate gratis and unconditionally. However, results predict that the commercialized regime could compromise underlying mechanisms of cooperation and allow defectors to prevail. As the trend further grows, academics would become more demanding of direct reward in exchange for cooperation, and they would refrain from engaging in cooperation but would prefer to work independently. Some interventions (e.g., centralized rewarding) could mitigate the problem but require delicate system design.","Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Shibayama, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538904, Japan.",shibayama@00.alumni.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"shibayama, sotaro/N-9565-2019","shibayama, sotaro/0000-0002-6701-9828",Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23810004]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23810004] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to Yasunori Baba, Thomas Hellmann, David N.

In a controlled study covering 145 child day-care centers, I implement three separate treatments. First, I engineer an exogenous change in compensation for childcare workers from fixed wages to performance pay. Second, I only provide mothers with information without incentivizing the workers. Third, I combine the first two treatments. This helps us identify if performance pay and public information are complements or substitutes in reducing child malnutrition. I find that combining incentives to workers and information to mothers reduces weight-for-age malnutrition by 4.2 percentage points in 3 months, although individually the effects are negligible. This complementarity is shown to be driven by better mother-worker communication and the mother feeding more calorific food at home. There is also a sustained long-run positive impact of the combined treatment after the experiment concluded. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This includes deduction of the fractal/intermittent fluctuations of macroeconomic quantities from the granularity of the mezo-economic collective objects (large individual wealth, highly productive geographical locations, emergent technologies, emergent economic sectors) in which the micro-economic agents self-organize. In particular, we present some theoretical predictions, which also met extensive validation from empirical data in a wide range of systemsThe fractal Levy exponent of the stock market index fluctuations equals the Pareto exponent of the investors wealth distribution. The origin of the macroeconomic dynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth/capital of the wealthiest investors. Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter 'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are -shaped cusps. In between the -cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2 'crossing exponentials': one increasing (corresponding to the creation of the 'new') and the other one decaying (corresponding to destruction of the 'old'). This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market fluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine conceptual synthesis between micro-and macroeconomics. Joining another giant of contemporary science-Phil Anderson 1972-Aoki emphasized the role of rare, large fluctuations in the emergence of macroeconomic phenomena out of microscopic interactions and in particular their non self-averaging, in the language of statistical physics. In this light, we present a simple stochastic multi-sector growth model.","[Solomon, Sorin; Golo, Natasa] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Instutute Phys, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Golo, N (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Instutute Phys, Jerusalem, Israel.",sorin@huji.ac.il; natasa.golo@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,4,4,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We use meta-analytical techniques to integrate the diverse empirical findings and investigate factors contribute to the inconsistencies in the empirical evidence. Using 419 correlations collected from 42 primary studies of listed corporations in 18 emerging markets, heterogeneity tests show that only a small proportion of the variation in reported ownership concentration-performance relations can be attributed to sampling error. Our meta-regressions reveal how population differences, researchers' modeling choices, and inadequate treatment of endogeneity explain a large portion of the true heterogeneity. After adjusting for these effects, we find ownership concentration has negative relation with firm performance across countries. Our results emphasize the importance of model specification and methods of addressing endogeneity, and support further comparative study of the ownership concentration-corporate performance relation between countries with seemingly similar corporate governance environments.","[Wang, Kun; Shailer, Greg] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Accounting & Business Informat Syst, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Wang, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Accounting & Business Informat Syst, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Wang, Kun Tracy/AFN-7369-2022; Shailer, Greg/D-1878-2011","Wang, Kun Tracy/0000-0003-2752-3891; Shailer, Greg/0000-0002-4896-4197",,,,,133,97,109,2,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

VAR estimates show that permanent and exogenous tax increases have strong, permanent, and negative effects on TFP which represent about 80% of change in output following the tax increase. I then build a DSGE model which has learning-by-doing and endogenous TFP evolution. The benchmark model is able to replicate the empirical impulse responses. However, when I calibrate the model as in the literature, the effect of taxes on TFP is substantially less elastic than in the data. I argue that this divergence may arise because tax changes labeled as exogenous can give spurious results or because of a mis-specified model. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using both structural VAR and structural factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) model, we find that tax-policy shocks have significant effects on the credit spread. Specifically, the credit spread responds first positively and then negatively to an exogenous tax increase in the two countries. Moreover, the impulse responses of the credit spread to tax-policy shocks do not always accord well with the impulse responses of the output. This indicates that there are channels of tax policy transmission to the credit spread other than through its impact on the business cycle. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using a standard New Keynesian dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model, we show that stagflation from monetary policy alone is a very common occurrence when the economy is subject to both deviations from the policy rule and a drifting inflation target. Once the inflation target is fixed, the incidence of stagflation in the baseline model is essentially eliminated. In contrast with several other recent papers that have focused on the connection between monetary policy and stagflation, we show that while high uncertainty about monetary policy actions can be conducive to the occurrence of stagflation, imperfect information more generally is not a requisite channel to generate stagflation.

We employ a difference-in-differences method, which controls for differences in student characteristics and course delivery method, to evaluate the impact of blended learning on student performance. Our results suggest that the impact of blended learning on student performance depends on whether the effect of blended learning is cumulative or not. Blended learning has no impact on student performance if learning is non-cumulative and only affects the performance on the quizzes associated with the material covered by blended learning. However, if learning is cumulative and impacts the performance for the whole course, then our results strongly suggest a strong, negative effect. Taken as a whole, these results provide a possible explanation for why most of the existing studies focusing on short online courses have obtained neutral or even positive results while nearly all the studies focusing on semester-length course tend to observe negative impacts from online learning.","[Kwak, Do Won; Menezes, Flavio M.; Sherwood, Carl] Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Menezes, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au,"Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551; Kwak, Do Won/0000-0001-5443-1576",,,,,23,17,28,1,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Starting from a given balance sheet structure of a banking system with a realistic distribution of bank sizes, the necessity of establishing interbank credit connections emerges from idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. Banks initially choose potential trading partners randomly, but over time form preferential relationships via an elementary reinforcement learning algorithm. As it turns out, the dynamic evolution of this system displays a formation of a core-periphery structure with mainly the largest banks assuming the roles of money center banks mediating between the liquidity needs of many smaller banks. Statistical analysis shows that this evolving interbank market shares the majority of the salient characteristics of interbank credit relationship that have been put forth in recent literature. Preferential interest rates for borrowers with strong attachment to a lender may prevent the system from becoming extortionary and guarantee the survival of the small peripherical banks.

As in previous experiments, we study four- and eight-person groups in high and low marginal per capita return (MPCR) conditions. We find a positive effect of group size in the low MPCR condition, as in previous experiments. However, in the high MPCR condition we observe a negative group size effect. We extend the design to investigate two- and three-person groups in the high MPCR condition, and find that cooperation is highest of all in two-person groups. The findings in the high MPCR condition are consistent with those from n-person prisoner's dilemma and oligopoly experiments that suggest it is more difficult to sustain cooperation in larger groups. The findings from the low MPCR condition suggest that this effect can be overridden. In particular, when cooperation is low other factors, such as considerations of the social benefits of contributing (which increase with group size), may dominate any negative group size effect.","[Nosenzo, Daniele; Quercia, Simone; Sefton, Martin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Sefton, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",daniele.nosenzo@nottingham.ac.uk; simone.quercia@nottingham.ac.uk; martin.sefton@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Quercia, Simone/0000-0002-4307-5219; Sefton, Martin/0000-0002-1327-7311; Nosenzo, Daniele/0000-0002-0831-5408",ESRC [ES/K002201/1]; Leverhulme Trust [ECF/2010/0636]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank David Cooper, two anonymous referees, Jeffrey Carpenter, Jimmy Walker, Joachim Weimann, and participants at the 2013 ESA Meeting in Zurich for useful comments.

The hypothesis is that dictators who stay in office for a long time period will find it increasingly difficult to carry out sound economic policies. We argue that such economic policies are the result of information asymmetries inherent to dictatorships (known as the dictator dilemma') and of changes in the personality of dictators (known as the winner effect'). We call the combination of these two terms the dictator effect'. We present evidence to suggest that long years in office impacts on economic growth (which is reduced), inflation (which increases) and the quality of institutions (which deteriorates). The negative effect of long years of tenure (i.e. the dictator effect') is particularly strong in young states and in Africa and the Near East.","[Papaioannou, Kostadis J.; Van Zanden, Jan Luiten] Univ Utrecht, Dept Social & Econ Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Papaioannou, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Social & Econ Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.",kostadis.papaioannou@wur.nl,,,,,,,92,13,14,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

However, the extent to which workers' careers might improve or deteriorate as a result of the unemployment insurance system is not immediately clear. This paper addresses the effects of certain aspects of this system on employment stability by jointly accounting for benefits endogeneity, dynamic selection issues and occurrence dependence. The analysis is undertaken for a dual labour market, such as the market in Spain, where temporary and permanent workers differ with respect to numerous individual and labour market characteristics. We find that non-insured unemployed workers experience a greater rate of transition to employment than insured workers. But we also find that benefits encourage job stability for temporary workers not only by increasing subsequent job tenure but also by increasing the probability of entering into a permanent contract. Finally, we get that shortening the duration of the benefit entitlement period does not seem to lead to significant gains in overall employment stability, which increases at most by 4.3 %.","[Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F.; Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Crta Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] FEDEA, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Rebollo-Sanz, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Crta Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",yfrebsan@upo.es; jigarper@upo.es,"Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./K-6940-2012; Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/D-2755-2009","Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./0000-0003-1876-7093; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-9074-7313","Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2010-21706, ECO2013-43526-R]",Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Bart Cockx, Konstantinos Tatsiramos, Samuel Bentolila and seminar participants at EALE 2012, ESPE 2013, and the Symposium of Economic Analysis for comments on previous versions of the paper.

The argument is made that the difficulties in securing long-term progress may be attributed to a number of factors, including the multifaceted nature of pay as a social phenomenon, the challenge of pursuing social objectives in a rapidly changing and fragmenting environment, the need for political will not technical solutions to achieve redistribution and the potential for gender inequalities to re-emerge in new forms.","[Rubery, Jill; Grimshaw, Damian] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",jill.rubery@mbs.ac.uk,,"Grimshaw, Damian/0000-0002-4564-4841",,,,,112,52,59,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, the association between family background and a child's cannabis use is weak. When analysing both family SES and education as determinants of a child's educational attainment, cannabis use should be treated as an effect modifier rather than a confounder. This article examines how cannabis use alters the protective effect of better family education on a child's school performance. By means of a retrospective cohort study using data from the Spanish National Survey on Drug Use in Secondary Education, this study illustrates that, as expected, children of better-educated parents are less likely to repeat a grade, although the positive impact of higher family education vanishes when students use cannabis.","[Rungo, Paolo; Casal, Bruno; Rivera, Berta; Currais, Luis] Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna 15071, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Rungo, P (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",paolo.rungo@udc.es,"Casal, Bruno/HJZ-4664-2023; Currais, Luis/AAO-6682-2021; Rungo, Paolo/B-8792-2017; Rivera, Berta/AAQ-4015-2021; Casal, Bruno/AAU-9018-2020","Rungo, Paolo/0000-0002-8413-7850; Rivera, Berta/0000-0002-0687-9883; Casal, Bruno/0000-0003-4888-2527; Currais, Luis/0000-0001-8488-8921",,,,,17,2,3,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We show that less talented players are more likely to drop out, and that the age-productivity gradient is heterogeneous by ability, making fixed effects estimators inconsistent. Since we do not observe the players who dropped out of chess before the beginning of our sampling period, we cannot exploit the standard Heckman sample selection correction procedure. Therefore, we correct for selection by using an imputation method that repopulates the sample by applying to older cohorts the self-selection patterns observed in younger cohorts. We estimate the age-productivity profile on the repopulated sample using median regressions, and find that median productivity increases by close to 5 percent from initial age (15) to peak age (21.6), and declines substantially after the peak. At age 50, it is about 10 percent lower than at age 15. We compare profiles in the unadjusted and in the repopulated sample and show that failure to adequately address endogenous selection in the former leads to substantially over-estimating productivity at any age relative to initial age.

This correlation is widely interpreted as evidence that short-run inflation is determined by supply-side factors; however, we study whether, in addition to the inflation rate, monetary policy and aggregate demand explain it. Using producer price index data, we show, first, that the positive and significant effect of relative-price change asymmetries on inflation is not robust with respect to various indicators of asymmetry. Second, using a VAR framework, we find that aggregate demand robustly affects the measures of asymmetries, which raises doubt about whether they can be interpreted as pure supply-side indicators. Third, in addition to the indirect effect via measures of asymmetries, demand directly affects inflation. Thus, we reject the claim that the recent disinflation/deflation period in Japan can be understood as primarily a supply-side phenomenon and suggest that the main driving force was demand, whereas supply and monetary policy were of lesser importance.

While the MENA region has been widely neglected in the trade and growth literature, this paper offers a decomposition of MENA GDP growth in order to disentangle the contributions of both service and goods trade. The results show a positive association between real GDP and both service and goods trade. The interaction term between trade in goods and trade in services is negative, suggesting that as goods trade increases, the marginal effect of service trade on real GDP decreases. However, the overall effect of service trade on real GDP is positive.

We employ macroeconomic fundamentals that are guided by the monetary model of exchange rates and market microstructure related frictions represented by order flow and bid-ask spreads to track long-run and short-run movements in exchange rates, respectively. Utilising the ARDL framework, we estimate the model using monthly data spanning the period January 1995 to March 2013.

We analyze the relationship between the special political connection of the OADs and banks' prudential behavior, using a sample of China's City Commercial Banks during 2006-2010. We further explore the impact of OADs' characteristics and the role of independent directors and female directors. The results indicate that banks with OADs exhibit lower prudential behavior, and the higher is the administrative rank of the OADs, the larger is the effect. And the older is the OADs, the larger is the effect. More importantly, the government ownership of banks does not have a significant and robust influence on their prudential behavior. Meanwhile, independent directors can significantly weaken the effect of the OADs, while female directors can enhance the prudential behavior of banks in the absence of OADs. Finally, our results persist even after controlling for sample selection bias and alternative variable measures. Our research contributes to the practice of improving bank governance and regulating systematic risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The allocations are not significantly different between the two games, providing evidence on the isomorphism (equivalence) of taking and giving. In both games, the passive players are pessimistic about (underestimate) their allocations. However, the nature of the pessimism varies. In the taking game, takees underestimate the average allocation of takees and expect that their allocations will be lower than the average. In the giving game, recipients underestimate the average amount received, but do not expect allocations different from the average. The results therefore indicate that framing (taking versus giving) affects the reasons for which beliefs are biased. Third parties also underestimate the average allocations of takees and recipients, suggesting that takees' and recipients' biased expectations about average allocations are not attributable to having monetary stakes in the game. I also find that the effect of the decision-maker's gender on allocations varies by game, takees' beliefs are related to trust, and recipients' beliefs relate to knowing more people.

We extend the development accounting framework by incorporating age structure and apply it to a panel data set of 28 Chinese provinces. We find that changes in age structure, as reflected by shifts in both the size and internal demographic composition of the working-age population, are significantly correlated with provincial economic growth rates. During our study period 1990-2005, the evolution of age structure accounts for nearly one-fifth of the growth in GDP per capita, of which more than half is attributable to shifts in the internal demographic composition of the working-age population. Differences in age structure across provinces also explain more than one-eighth of the persistent inter-provincial income inequality. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (1) (2015) 170-185.

Manufacturing as a whole has registered slow wage growth since the late 1990s, with labour markets characterized by heavy presence of low-skilled foreign workers, increased contract labour and outsourcing and declining worker organization. The focus on perspiration-based low-skilled foreign labour rather than on expanding professional and skilled labour has driven Malaysia down the low industrialization road. The Malaysian experience reflects a case of manufacturing's importance and direct contribution to the economy contracting before recording high levels of value added and sustained productivity growth, and with labour market practices constraining instead of facilitating positive change.","[Rasiah, Rajah; Lee, Hwok-Aun] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Crinis, Vicki] Univ Wollongong, Fac Law Humanities & Creat Arts, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",Universiti Malaya; University of Wollongong,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; LEE, Hwok-Aun/B-8835-2010; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011; Crinis, Vicki/0000-0002-4381-0340",,,,,61,21,22,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We offer new evidence suggesting a significant heterogeneity across countries, both in terms of the risk factors determining spreads over time as well as in terms of the magnitude of their impact on spreads. Our findings suggest that the relationship between euro area sovereign risk and the underlying fundamentals is strongly time-varying, turning from inactive to active since the onset of the global financial crisis and further intensifying during the sovereign debt crisis.

We reassess the author's identification strategy, which they refer to as 'portfolio approach' and which draws upon event studies in finance research. We argue that their methodology is not applicable in crime studies. Instead, we apply univariate time-series methods to test for a structural break at a known and unknown break date. We allow for unknown break points as the structural break might have occurred slightly earlier (criminals might have anticipated the moratorium) or later (due to persistence in criminal behaviour). In addition, we implement the synthetic control estimator which approximates the counterfactual homicide series by a weighted average of homicide outcomes in other US states. Based on various testing methods and two distinct data sets, we conclude that there is no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that the Illinois' execution moratorium significantly increased homicides.","[Ahrens, A.] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Accountancy Econ & Finance, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kovandzic, T.

Specifically, we use dummy-augmented GARCH models to investigate the impact of this specific calendar day on the conditional means of gold, silver, palladium and platinum returns. The specification of the GARCH model follows a flexible class recently proposed by Leon et al. (2005) that incorporates time-varying skewness and kurtosis by applying a Gram-Charlier series expansion of the normal density function. Our results for the period from July 1996 to August 2013 provide three important insights. First, there is no evidence that human superstition regarding bad luck Fridays affects precious metals markets in a negative way, i.e. returns on Fridays the 13th are not significantly lower than on regular Fridays. Second, besides showing robustness in a variety of settings, we can confirm this main result in a sensitivity check, where we replace the dummy variables by a new measure of investor attention, recently promoted by Da et al. (2011), that is based on Google search volumes. Third, as an important by-product of our study, we can show that there is significant evidence of time-varying skewness and kurtosis in precious metals returns.","Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Auer, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",auer@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,108,12,12,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Considering that slow growing and problem-prone countries may be less likely to receive aid, we instrument for economic aid by estimating donor-to-donee aid flows in a first-stage procedure.

Despite having adopted a 'successful' export-led growth strategy since the early 1980s, these two phenomena have characterised the Mexican economy during the past three decades. In this article I investigate whether premature de-industrialisation has been a major contributor to Mexico's economic stagnation and attempt to identify which factors have been driving it. The results confirm the hypothesis of premature de-industrialisation and suggest that the evolution of income, capital accumulation, labour manufacturing productivity, trade openness and the exchange rate provide an explanation for this process. I also suggest a set of alternative policy measures aimed at returning the Mexican economy to the path of growth and development.","[Cruz, Moritz] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Cruz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, CU, Circuito Mario Cueva S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",aleph3_98@yahoo.com,"Cruz, Moritz/AAC-1229-2020","Cruz, Moritz/0000-0002-3771-8302",,,,,43,16,19,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Thus aims to analyse the existing correlations between these variables. In this paper we will make a literature review for each of the variables under study, namely continuous education, intellectual capital and company value. The study will focus on companies quoted on the Portuguese Stock Market in the period (2010-2012). To analyse the relationship between investment in continuous education and the market value relevance of the company's intangibles, will be used Tobin's Q (Andriessen, 2004). Expenditure in intangibles are an investment in business management terms. Educational attainments seems to have strategic importance in the knowledge intensive economy, and the human capital is a drive of value (Caragliu and Nijkamp, 2014). The literature considers that much of the value generated in the company is resulting from its intangible elements, namely, the intellectual capital (Edvinsson and Malone, 1997; Stewart, 1999; Kavida and Sivakoumar, 2010; Murale, 2010). Studies have shown that investment in intellectual capital dimensions results in an increase in worker productivity which, in turn, is translated into an increase in financial performance and, consequently, generates increases in the future market value of the firm (Zambrano et al., 2011). The literature review suggests that the value of the intangibles is the main factor responsible for the difference between the book value and the market value of companies.","Univ Lusiada, V N Famalicao, Portugal",,"Diniz, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Lusiada, V N Famalicao, Portugal.",luisfgestor@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,369,376,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600043,0

Using a unique Australian data set, which consists of survey data linked to administrative individual medical records, we present empirical evidence demonstrating that SAH indeed predicts future health, as measured by hospitalizations, out-of-hospital medical services and prescription drugs. Our large sample size allows very disaggregate analysis and we find that SAH predicts more serious, chronic illnesses better than less serious illnesses. Finally, we compare the predictive power of SAH relative to administrative data and an extensive set of self-reported health measures; SAH does not add to the predictive power of future utilization when the administrative data is included and improves prediction only marginally when the extensive survey-based health measures are included. Clearly there is value in the more extensive survey and administrative health data as well as greater cost of collection.","[Doiron, Denise; Fiebig, Denzil G.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Johar, Meliyanni] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Suziedelyte, Agne] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; Monash University,"Johar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",meliyanni.johar@uts.edu.au,"Suziedelyte, Agne/I-3099-2019","Suziedelyte, Agne/0000-0003-2420-9231; Fiebig, Denzil/0000-0002-3707-1940",,,,,33,58,65,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is essential for SMEs in Serbia where these enterprises are facing numerous problems in operation and performance of innovative activities. Starting from the existing theoretical views about the importance of creating innovative SMEs business network which results in the creation and delivery of unique value to the market, the authors tend to explore the innovative capacity of SMEs in Serbia and identify opportunities for cooperation with key stakeholders. Wider interest in empirical research coincides with the need for more intensive involvement of Serbian SMEs in foreign markets. The survey was conducted on a sample of 304 SMEs in Serbia. In the survey, data were collected using personal interview and in-depth interview. The questionnaire is structured in such a way that allows to identify the importance which managers attribute to cooperation with key stakeholders, in order to increase their innovative capacity. The findings indicate that the SMEs managers in Serbia still do not perceive the importance of connecting with stakeholders to perform the innovative activities. Based on these findings, SMEs managers would do well if they pay attention to open innovation as new innovative practices which can contribute to create valuable knowledge necessary to perform innovative activities. For academics, this paper indicates the need for a further research in order to identify the obstacles SMEs in Serbia are facing within the process of networking with both domestic and foreign stakeholders, which is the reason they are underused in increasing innovative capacity.","[Dukic, Suzana; Stankovic, Ljiljana; Lepojevic, Vinko] Univ Nis, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Dukic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",suzana.djukic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; ljiljana.stankovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; vinko.lepojevic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Djukić, Suzana/ABH-6482-2020","Djukić, Suzana/0000-0003-1640-2365; Lepojevic, Vinko/0000-0002-8364-1078",,,,,58,3,4,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We measure the latter by the extensive margin that means the probability of becoming an exporter and the probability of serving several markets. We found a significant and positive impact of dealing with banks and having banking facilities on the probability of exporting and that of exporting to more than one destination.

Research is based on interviews that explore local manufacturing subsidiaries' production processes and functional upgrading experience. Our findings show that there are differences among the firms regarding the extent of the upgrading. This depends, on the one hand, on the owner's global strategy, as well as on the type of final product being turned out. On the other hand local capabilities are of vital importance among the factors that influence the volume of intangible transfers. Furthermore, our interviews have suggested that upgrading is not a mono-directional process: previously gained mandates can also be lost.

In line with the traditional artistic hierarchy of genres, average price differentials between them were high. The matched painter-patron nature of the dataset allows us to evaluate the extent to which price heterogeneity is related to unobservable characteristics of painters and patrons.

Analysis is conducted on both binary measures of fragility and the actual CPIA scores using an array of estimation techniques. Findings indicate that democracy, income levels, economic growth, levels of education, country size and natural resource rents are important determinants of fragility.

Our results explaining differences in saving behavior across households are consistent with theory and previous findings. As might be expected, households' saving ratios tend to increase with income, but decrease with wealth and gearing. More at-risk households such as single-parent and migrant households tend to save more than other households, all else being equal. While saving differs substantially across age groups we find that, at least in part, this reflects differing circumstances. Our results suggest that the rise in household saving between 2003/2004 and 2009/2010 was driven by changes in behavior rather than changes in population characteristics: in particular, more educated households, as well as households with high debt and/or wealth increased their propensity to save. Our interpretation of these results is that a reduction in future income growth expectations for more highly educated households after the financial crisis, and an associated effort to rebuild wealth and repay debt, drove to the aggregate rise in household saving.","[Finlay, Richard; Price, Fiona] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Finlay, Richard] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Reserve Bank of Australia; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Finlay, R (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank Australia, 65 Martin Pl, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",finlayr@rba.gov.au,"Finlay, Richard/JRY-0409-2023","Finlay, Richard/0000-0003-0914-1910",,,,,30,1,1,1,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Since growth is viewed as demand-driven, this involves bringing demand into line with the sustainable 'ecological footprint'. A simple model of demand-driven growth is constructed from which some basic conclusions are drawn of the consequences of slower growth and lower investment, including those for the rate of interest and the rate of profit. The macroeconomic policy to deliver full employment is indicated. The growth of the effective labour force and the sustainable rate of growth of the 'ecological footprint' are introduced and the relationships between them and the demand-driven rate of growth is explored. The macroeconomic analysis has to be embedded with analysis of the monetary and financial system. For this purpose a circuitist analysis is presented. The paper considers the ways in which the monetary and financial systems should be restructured to be consistent with sustainable growth and low unemployment. The major aims of this restructuring would be to underpin financial stability, and more importantly to focus the financial sector on the allocation of funds into environmentally friendly investment.","[Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Monetary Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy; [Sawyer, Malcolm] Univ Leeds, Econ, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Sannio; University of Leeds,"Fontana, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Monetary Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,74,6,7,0,0,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-44613-8; 978-1-137-44612-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,74,110,,,,,,37,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380488600003,0

This article examines whether financial frictions play an important role in this mutual relationship. Instrumental variable Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (IV-PPML) estimation method is applied to a new panel of data on US imports and foreign equity holdings in 20 manufacturing sectors from 43 countries over the period 2001-2007. The results confirm the significantly positive relationship between goods trade and equity holdings, and show that financial frictions are an important factor causing this positive correlation. In addition, we find that equity cross-listings in the US stock markets provide external funds to relax financial frictions and promote goods trade. This impact varies with different measures of financial frictions in developing and developed countries.","[Guo, Meixin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Pan, Huiran] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",Tsinghua University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Guo, MX (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",guomx@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While standard time domain Granger causality test fails to reject the null hypothesis that sunspot numbers do not cause global temperatures for both full and sub-samples (identified based on tests of structural breaks), the frequency domain causality test detects predictability for both the full-sample and the last sub-sample at short (2-2.6 months) and long (10.3 months and above) cycle lengths, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of analysing causality using the frequency domain test, which, unlike the time domain Granger causality test, allows us to decompose causality by different time horizons, and hence, could detect predictability at certain cycle lengths even when the time domain causality test might fail to pick up any causality. Further, given the widespread discussion in the literature, those results for the full-sample causality, irrespective of whether it is in time or frequency domains, cannot be relied upon when there are structural breaks present, and one needs to draw inference regarding causality from the sub-samples, we can conclude that there has been an emergence of causality running from sunspot numbers to global temperatures only recently at cycle length of 10.3 months and above.","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Navarra, Spain; [Yaya, Olaoluwa S.] Univ Ibadan, Fac Sci, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Pretoria; University of Navarra; University of Ibadan,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./N-1615-2019","YAYA, OLAOLUWA S./0000-0002-7554-3507",,,,,74,14,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We measure the technology parameters of each sector and the partition of the economy consistent with the identifying assumption of each sector (i.e., difference in productivity growth), by implementing a structural estimation on individual earnings equations.

However, using risk attitudes as a control variable for decisions about education has been criticized because of the potential for reverse causality. Causality between risk aversion and education is unclear, and disentangling the different directions it may run is difficult. In this study, we make the first attempt to investigate the causal effects of education on risk aversion by examining the British education reform of 1972, which increased the duration of compulsory schooling from age 15 to age 16. Using regression discontinuity design, we find that this additional year of schooling increases the level of risk aversion, which is contrary to previous findings in the literature, and we also find that this result is particularly strong for individuals with less education. This positive causal effect of education on risk aversion might alleviate concerns regarding the endogeneity/reverse causality issue when using risk aversion as an explanatory variable for decisions about education; the sign would remain credible because the coefficients are underestimated.","[Jung, Seeun] ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Jung, Seeun] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France",ESSEC Business School; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Jung, S (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",jung@essec.edu,,,,,,,32,31,37,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We incorporate multitasking into a household production model in which time spent in childcare can be sole-tasked or multitasked with another household production activity and we present the results of an experiment designed to measure the productivity parameters of this model. Because utility and productivity are intertwined and difficult to disentangle in any household production model, we vary the utility pay-offs our experimental participants receive in order to determine how our estimated productivity parameters are affected by a change in the utility parameters. Our estimates of the relative multitasking productivities indicate that, while a minute of sole-tasked time produces more of a single commodity than a minute of multitasked time, total household output increases when two outputs are produced simultaneously, hence confirming the economic motivation for multitasking.","[Kalenkoski, Charlene M.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Foster, Gigi] Univ New S Wales, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kalenkoski, CM (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",charlene.kalenkoski@ttu.edu,"Foster, Gigi/D-5297-2019; Kalenkoski, Charlene/M-1967-2019","Foster, Gigi/0000-0002-1588-0202;",,,,,34,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We apply a recently developed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) unit root test with multiple structural breaks to crude palm oil spot and future prices and find much more evidence against weak-form efficiency than that found using tests that fail to allow for conditional heteroscedasticity.

In a repo, some assets are given by a borrower as collateral in exchange of funding. The capital given to the borrower is the market value of the collateral, reduced by an amount termed as haircut (or margin). The haircut protects the capital lender from loss of value of the collateral contingent on the borrower's default. For this reason, the haircut is typically calculated with a simple Value at Risk estimation of the collateral for the purpose of preventing the risk associated to volatility. However, other risk factors should be included in the haircut and a severe undervaluation of them could result in a significant loss of value of the collateral if the borrower defaults. In this paper we present a stylized model of the financial system, which allows us to compute the haircut incorporating the liquidity risk of the collateral and, most important, possible systemic effects. These are mainly due to the similarity of bank portfolios, excessive leverage of financial institutions, and illiquidity of assets. The model is analytically solvable under some simplifying assumptions and robust to the relaxation of these assumptions, as shown through Monte Carlo simulations. We also show which are the most critical model parameters for the determination of haircuts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is increasingly important to enhance more generic abilities in individuals so they can apply their knowledge in real-world environments characterized by change, complexity and uncertainty. This has been addressed by sharing the importance of the development of metacompetencies in students studying engineering, allowing them to operate effectively, fostering entrepreneurship and employability. This can be achieved through entrepreneurship education in universities focusing on increasing creativity, self-efficacy, systematic thinking, awareness of opportunities and learning to learn. The aim of the current paper is to suggest a new approach to enhancing entrepreneurship education in engineering students through the development of their metacompetencies, with an emphasis on metacognition. The study includes a quantitative survey the results of which have been analysed using linear statistical analysis and Kmeans clustering. Furthermore, the role of personal characteristics, study level and disciplines have been analysed. The results confirm that the differences in levels of metacognition in students from different study levels and disciplines need to be considered when planning entrepreneurship courses. In addition, the study environment and motivation of students are important to consider when designing the programme for entrepreneurship courses.","[Ling, Hannes; Venesaar, Urve] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Ling, H (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Akad Tee 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",hannesling@smail.ee; urve.venesaar@ttu.ee,,,,,,,51,11,14,2,70,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Nevertheless, scientists do not define which stakeholders should be considered as the most or the least important. For this reason, the stakeholder grouping in accordance with their importance to the organization has been done. Stakeholders are divided into internal and external; primary and secondary; normative, functional, diffused and customers; regulatory, organizational, community and media; groups in the order of power and interest. In this paper, we also highlighted another stakeholder group, which we call a shadow group due to its illegal impact on the organization or industry. The analysis of stakeholder grouping initiated that while grouping stakeholders in accordance with their importance to the organization, it is worth to divide them into primary and secondary. Allocating the stakeholders to the primary and secondary groups unconsciously leads to the conclusion that primary stakeholders take the first, i.e. the most important place with regard to secondary stakeholders. It was observed that the scientists, acting on business interests, propose that even these stakeholders who find themselves in the same stakeholder group have unequal importance - the organizations give the priority to stakeholders, previously considered as the secondary. Consequently, because of these two different mainstream approaches of the theorists and the scientists, acting on business interests, it remains unclear what stakeholders should be attributed to which groups considering their importance to organization.","[Matuleviciene, Migle; Stravinskiene, Jurgita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Matuleviciene, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",migle.matuleviciene@gmail.com; jurgita.stravinskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,46,22,31,6,52,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We empirically examine and determine the turning point of debt-to-GDP ratio and evaluate the impact of levels of indebtedness in public sector on current economic growth for a panel dataset of 36 countries (31 OECD member states and 5 non-OECD EU member countries). The evaluation will give us an important understanding on the current indebtedness situation by determining the threshold values for our sample of countries, which indicates a possible non-linear and concave connection between indebtedness levels in the public sector and economic growth in the short term. Our sample is divided into subgroups distinguishing between so-called developed economies, covering the period 1980-2010, and emerging economies, covering the period 1995-2010. To evaluate a possible negative correlation and concave functional form between public debt and potential economic growth, we employ a panel estimation on a generalized economic growth model augmented with a debt variable, while also considering some methodological issues like the problems of heterogeneity and endogeneity. The results confirm the general theoretical assumption that at low levels of public debt the impact on growth is positive, whereas beyond a certain debt turning point a negative effect on growth prevails. Further, we calculated that the debt-to-GDP turning point, where the positive effect of accumulated public debt inverts into a negative effect, is roughly between 90 % and 94 % for developed economies. Yet, for emerging countries, the debt-to-GDP turning point is lower, namely between 44 % and 45 %.

Turnover of nursing staff is a significant issue affecting healthcare cost, quality and access. Voluntary turnover of nursing personnel is expensive-studies published between 1990 and 2014 estimate turnover costs for a registered nurse (RN) between US$10,000 and US$88,000. Employer-of-choice are magnet organizations characterized by their ability to generate positive perceptions by staff as 'great places to work.' Organizations that are seen to be employers-of-choice are characterized by their ability to both attract and retain staff. It is hypothesized that healthcare organizations regarded as employers-of-choice will have greater accumulations of social capital in their nursing units. A mediated model is proposed to test the relationship between social capital and employer-of-choice strength on employee voluntary turnover. A questionnaire was mailed to the chief nursing officers of 2208 hospitals and long-term care facilities in every province and territory of Canada, yielding valid responses from 705 establishments. Using voluntary employee turnover as the dependent variable, the analysis featured a step-wise ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model that examined the mediating role of employer-of-choice strength and social capital accumulation. Results demonstrate that healthcare organizations with lower nursing turnover have greater accumulations of social capital and are more likely to be regarded as a strong 'employer-of-choice.' After controlling for local labor market conditions and establishment characteristics, nurse social capital and employer-of-choice strength was found to be inversely associated with voluntary RN turnover (p<.001), yet explained only an additional seven percent of the total variance for establishment turnover. Employer-of-choice was found to fully mediate the relationship of nurse social capital on RN turnover.","Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Rondeau, K (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",kent.rondeau@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,31,0,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,279,285,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600033,0

The data set, from March 2000 to March 2014, covers different market phases and stock market crashes, such as the recent global financial crisis and the Euro Area debt crisis. Due to the nonlinear nature of the relation between the variables, the study employs a threshold error-correction model based on two distinct regimes extended to incorporate asymmetries related to short-term good or bad news from the two markets. Within this framework, the empirical evidence shows that there is a long-run equilibrium between the two variables during the time period investigated.

In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with one another over the expansion of their market shares at the expense of their competitors. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J. S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with one another.","Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Tsoulfidis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",Lnt@uom.edu.gr,,"Tsoulfidis, Lefteris/0000-0003-2691-0128",,,,,41,10,12,0,3,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62,1,,,,,15,31,,10.2298/PAN1501015T,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF8QF,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352826300002,0

Panel regression analysis is conducted for the period 1980 to 2013. The findings support existing literature about developing countries demonstrating that fiscal policies are strongly procyclical in SACs and there is significant evidence of persistence. Revenues have decreased and expenditures have increased with output cycle which has deteriorated the fiscal balance. This indicates that fiscal balance is procyclical with output cycle in SACs and this procyclicality increases during good times. The results suggest that SACs can conduct counter cyclical fiscal policies if they stabilize output, control inflation and structural shocks, have deep financial markets, high financial openness, have few veto players in the political procedures and have stronger institutions. These results are robust to alternative measures of output cycle and model specifications.","[Zakaria, Muhammad; Xi Junyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ SHUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zakaria, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol CIIT, Islamabad, Pakistan",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Zakaria, M (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ SHUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,7,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We divide these driving factors into cost-and demand-side dependence. Empirical results reveal that sensitivity varies across different industries and periods based on structural breaks and asymmetric effects of oil price changes. Furthermore, some industries seemingly not directly affected by oil are sensitive to the real oil price changes.

A regime shift is defined as an episode in which the dynamics of the resource can switch between two alternative regimes at random times. Specifically, we study the impact of reversible regime switching, both observed and unobserved, on optimal harvesting policy. The case in which the regime is not directly observed, i.e., observational uncertainty, is addressed by using the extended POMDP approach developed in Fackler and Pacifici (2014). We illustrate the performance of the model under different assumptions on the underlying stochastic growth variability, the biological structure of the stock in different regimes, and the resilience of the regimes. When the regime is known optimal policies depend on the population level and which regime is currently active. When the regime is unobserved, on the other hand, the optimal policy depends on the population level and a belief distribution about the current regime. In general when the probability of regime change is fixed, and hence is not affected by harvesting policy, the optimal policy is of the constant-escapement variety. When the probability of switching regime is endogenous the optimal policy is no longer of the constant-escapement type. Optimal policies when the regime is uncertain are approximately equal to a weighted average of the policies when the regime is certain, with the weights equal to the beliefs in the associated regimes, but there are differences.

Based on the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) that controls for instrument proliferation, we discover the following results. First, when both the proliferation of instruments problem and the biased standard error in SGMM are accounted for, the results reveal that only in non-inflation crisis countries does inflation harm growth, while inflation uncertainty promotes growth. Empirical results, based on a three-regime model, confirm the negative growth effect of high inflation rates and the growth enhancing effect of low inflation. Second, the negative-level effect of not keeping inflation in check outweighs the positive effect from uncertainty in non-inflation crisis countries in all three regimes. Third, the existence of a positive effect of uncertainty about the inflation rate on growth through a precautionary motive is confirmed when inflation reaches moderate ranges (5.6-15.9%). These findings are robust, although only for non-inflation crisis countries, to a battery of diagnostic tests, including the issue of weak and the proliferation of instruments and biased standard error.

Our results suggest that when structural breaks are accounted for, all five inflation indicators are stationary. Second, our findings suggest that persistence is not too high. Moreover, the degree of persistence is similar among the five inflation indicators and throughout the sample period. Finally, our results also show that extracting the most volatile components of the headline inflation indicator does not generate a new inflation indicator that is less volatile and more persistent than the original. These results have important policy implications as the National Bank of Angola is preparing to change its monetary policy focus to a more inflation-targeting regime.","[Belbute, Jose Manuel] Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Evora, Portugal; [Belbute, Jose Manuel] Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ CEFAGE UE, Evora, Portugal; [Massala, Leonardo Dia] Banco Nacl Angola, Dept Econ Studies, Luanda, Angola; [Delgado, Julio Antonio] INOVE Res, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",University of Evora,"Belbute, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Evora, Portugal.",jbelbute@uevora.pt,"Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/P-6256-2019","Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/0000-0001-8738-0592; Belbute, Jose/0000-0002-6877-0218",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; FEDER/COMPETE [UID/ECO/04007/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),Contract grant sponsor: Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and FEDER/COMPETE; contract grant number: UID/ECO/04007/2013.,,33,1,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Each country faces a trade-off in terms of social welfare when considering whether to increase its size. As a country's size increases, the government can collect more taxes and provide more public goods, which, all else equal, makes its citizens better off. On the other hand, a country that increases its size is assumed to also increase the heterogeneity of its citizens' preferences leading to increased mismatch between preferences and the public goods provided by government. Notwithstanding the benefit of greater quantities of public goods afforded by living in a larger country, greater dissatisfaction with the public goods provided by government (i.e. preference mismatch) makes some segments of the citizenry worse off. Contrary to Alesina and Spolaore (1997), we show that a symmetric national border may be unstable. We also examine whether voluntary declaration of nationality guarantees the social optimum. Despite economies of scale from unification, the model implies that, from a social welfare perspective, there may be either too few, or too many, countries. Unification leading to fewer countries can be social welfare enhancing if people's preferences in those states are quite similar; secessions leading to a greater number of smaller states can be social welfare enhancing if preferences are sufficiently heterogenous.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Otago; Kyung Hee University,"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",prof.berg@gmail.com; jyookim@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The model suggests that firms with more state ownership tend to pay less in bribes but not have a different experience of costly obstacles imposed on them by politicians. In our full sample, the results suggest that a one percentage increase in state ownership is associated with a $125 reduction in the total annual informal payment of the firm and with a 0.5 % decrease in the probability that a firm will consider corruption to be an obstacle to their current operations. We refine these average relationships by splitting the sample by global region. Only in our Europe and Central Asia sample do we find strong evidence in support of the first result and again we find a significant effect of state ownership on obstacles.","[Billon, Steve] Univ Strasbourg, LaRGE, 1 Pl Athenes,BP 66, F-67045 Strasbourg, France; [Gillanders, Robert] Hanken Sch Econ, POB 479, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Hanken School of Economics,"Billon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, LaRGE, 1 Pl Athenes,BP 66, F-67045 Strasbourg, France.",sbillon@unistra.fr; rgillanders@gmail.com,"Gillanders, Robert/I-5105-2019","Gillanders, Robert/0000-0001-9462-0005; Billon, Steve/0000-0001-7288-5387",,,,,29,14,14,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Simply starting the repeated game over-a simple fresh start-leads to an initial increase of cooperation, but to a subsequent new decay. Motivated by cooperation decay in organizations we study the potential of three interventions of triggering higher and sustained cooperation, which take place at the same time as a restart. Surprisingly, we find that the detailed explanation of the causes of the decay in cooperation of Fischbacher and Gachter (Am Econ Rev 100:541-556, 2010) combined with an advice on how to prevent decay do not have an effect beyond that of just starting over. In contrast, a one-way free form communication message sent by the leader to the followers strongly revives cooperation. We find evidence that repeated free form communication by the leader further strengthens the reviving effect on cooperation. Combining the two previous interventions does not outperform the pure effect of communication. Our content analysis reveals that leader communication is more people oriented than the expert advice.","[Brandts, Jordi] Inst Analisis Econ CSIC, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Brandts, Jordi] Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Rott, Christina] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ AE1, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Sola, Carles] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Maastricht University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Rott, C (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ AE1, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",jordi.brandts@iae.csic.es; c.rott@maastrichtuniversity.nl; carles.sola.belda@uab.es,"Belda, Carles Sola/K-5179-2017; Belda, Carles Sola/P-1721-2019","Belda, Carles Sola/0000-0002-2646-0465; Belda, Carles Sola/0000-0002-2646-0465; Rott, Christina/0000-0002-4092-473X; Brandts, Jordi/0000-0001-9082-9258",Antoni Serra Ramoneda (UAB-Catalunya Caixa) Research Chair; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2011-29847-C02-01]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009 SGR 820]; Barcelona GSE,Antoni Serra Ramoneda (UAB-Catalunya Caixa) Research Chair; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Barcelona GSE,"We would like to thank Gary Charness, Orsola Garofalo, Ernesto Reuben, Julian Rode, Arthur Schram, Daniel Schunk and the participants in the discussion lunch at the Business Department at UAB, at the Alhambra workshop 2011, at the IMEBE conference 2013 and at the ABEE conference 2014 as well as several seminar participants and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on how to improve the paper.

Our main findings are that (i) both foreign demand and exchange rate elasticities vary substantially across both export sectors and export destinations. (ii) Foreign demand trends are more important for structural considerations than the exchange rate. This is due to the fact that exports of the two largest export sectors are relatively sensitive to long-run foreign demand developments while they are relatively insensitive to changes in the exchange rate. (iii) The sectoral structure of Switzerland's exports has shifted towards goods that have a lower short-run demand elasticity and a higher long-run demand elasticity. Goods exports are thus less influenced by business cycle fluctuations while they benefit more from long-term growth trends. (iv) The export share of sectors with a relatively low exchange rate elasticity has increased. However, this result is mainly driven by the strong rise in exports of chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as precision instruments and watches, which are also the two important sectors responsible for the Swiss trade surplus.","[Grossmann, Sandra Hanslin; Schmidt, Caroline] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lein, Sarah M.] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Basel, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Basel,"Grossmann, SH (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland.",sandra.hanslin@snb.ch,"Lein, Sarah/AAQ-9774-2021","Lein, Sarah/0000-0002-2303-6941",,,,,23,5,5,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Within-family estimations, using samples of siblings, and twin pairs, are employed to overcome the bias generated by unobserved family background and genetic traits. The results suggest no significant effects on health outcomes, and modest effects on health behaviors, including exercise and preventive care. However, accounting for life-cycle effects demonstrates that teenage childbearing has significant effects on both health outcomes and behaviors early in life, but very few significant effects later in life. Moreover, teenage childbearing has a particularly acute effect among minorities.

I confront one of the most influential ones, the constitutive explanations or mechanism approach, with methodological claims that directly relate the economic model of choice with neuronal embodiments, represented by Glimcher's influential work. Constitutive explanations are composite and non-reductionist, therefore allow for recognizing complex causal interactions between basal neuronal phenomena and cognitive structures, also involving external symbolic media. I demonstrate the power of this methodology in discussing the example of money, which Glimcher posits as one of the most important research tasks in further developing neuroeconomics.

Unlike other estimated small-open-economy DSGE models, we find that more than one third of the domestic GDP growth is driven by foreign shocks. The elevated contribution of foreign shocks to the domestic economy is driven by our decision to exclude mapping export demand to data on world GDP. Estimating our model without any foreign demand data limits the response of exports to the real exchange variations. This feature makes exports and, consequently, domestic GDP much more sensitive to variations to foreign demand and raises the importance of foreign shocks to the domestic business cycle. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that a model with adaptive expectations is preferred by the data relative to the version of the model with rational expectations. In that case, the model explains nominal variables using on average much smaller shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find strong evidence that the excise tax on beer is overshifted to consumers. The pass-through coefficient is estimated at 4.83 (95% CI: 4.02; 5.64) for lager, and at 4.77 (95% CI: 4.04; 5.50) for all beer (which includes dark beer). This implies that for every R1/unit increase in the excise tax, the retail price increases by about R4.80/unit. Of the 23 brand-packaging combinations considered, the pass-through coefficients vary between 2.39 and 10.05 (median=5.30). The majority of the price change in response to a tax change occurs immediately, and prices have fully adjusted two months after the excise tax increase becomes effective. Pass-through differs substantially across packaging types. The pass-through coefficient on 750 ml bottles is substantially lower than that of 330 ml (or 340 ml) cans and 6 x 330 ml (or 6 x 340 ml) six-packs. The overshifting of the excise tax has positive implications for public health policy, since they increase the effectiveness of alcohol taxes as a tool to reduce the (excessive) consumption of beer.","[van Walbeek, Corne] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Russell, Caitlan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of Cape Town; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"van Walbeek, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.",cwalbeek@gmail.com,"van Walbeek, Corne/AFV-9136-2022","van Walbeek, Corne/0000-0003-0933-435X",,,,,35,9,9,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The results first present the weak evidence of cointegration between RGDP and overall globalization and its three main sub-indices. Second, the empirical evidence shows a bidirectional causality between RGDP and overall globalization, economic as well as social, but higher political globalization harms RGDP in the sample countries.

But in 2015, Chinese GDP grew at 7 %, the lowest rate in 5 years. Many corporations complain that the borrowing cost of capital is too high. This paper constructs Chinese Divisia monetary aggregates M1 and M2, and, for the first time, constructs the broader Chinese monetary aggregates, M3 and M4. Those broader aggregates have never before been constructed for China, either as simple-sum or Divisia. The results shed light on the current Chinese monetary situation and the increased borrowing cost of money. GDP data are published only quarterly and with a substantial lag, while many monetary and financial decisions are made at a higher frequency. GDP nowcasting can evaluate the current month's GDP growth rate, given the available economic data up to the point at which the nowcasting is conducted. Therefore, nowcasting GDP has become an increasingly important task for central banks. This paper nowcasts Chinese monthly GDP growth rate using a dynamic factor model, incorporating as indicators the Divisia monetary aggregate indexes, Divisia M1 and M2 along with additional information from a large panel of other relevant time series data. The results show that Divisia monetary aggregates contain more indicator information than the simple sum aggregates, and thereby help the factor model produce the best available nowcasting results. In addition, our results demonstrate that China's economy experienced a regime switch or structure break in 2012, which a Chow test confirmed the regime switch. Before and after the regime switch, the factor models performed differently. We conclude that different nowcasting models should be used during the two regimes.","[Barnett, William A.; Tang, Biyan] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Barnett, William A.] Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA",University of Kansas,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA.",barnett@ku.edu,"Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022",,,,,,46,13,14,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In one variant of mixed finance, some countries (e.g., Germany) allow eligible beneficiaries to fully exit from the public (social insurance) system and purchase private insurance. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we empirically investigate the predictions of a political economy model of mixed systems of public and private finance with two types of exit: universal-exit, when all individuals can choose to exit the public system, and conditional exit, when only individuals with an income at or above a threshold income level can choose to exit. We find that high-income individuals are less likely to exit under universal-exit than under conditional-exit, despite having the same incentive to exit in both treatments. Sensitivity treatments suggests that a number of factors may be at play in explaining this result, including learning effects, a priming effect and a framing effect, but that other regarding preferences do not appear to be an important factor.

The RWGTM passes electricity-sector natural gas prices to the ReEDS model, while the ReEDS model returns electricity-sector natural gas demand to the RWGTM. The two models successfully converge to a solution under reference scenario conditions. We present electricity-sector and natural gas sector evolution using the integrated models for this reference scenario. This paper demonstrates that the integrated models produced similar national-level results as when running in a stand-alone form, but that regional and state-level results can vary considerably. As we highlight, these regional differences have potentially significant implications for electric sector planners especially in the wake of substantive policy changes for the sector (e.g., the Clean Power Plan).

Assessments of behavior show a north/south pattern: participants from northern countries are perceived to be more honest and to provide more effort in a volunteering game than participants from southern countries. Actual behavior is, however, not always in line with these assessments. Assessments of honesty show strong evidence of social projection: Participants expect other European citizens to be less honest if they are culturally closer to themselves.

On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation. Our results imply that financial globalisation has modified the transmission of monetary policy by strengthening the importance of the exchange rate channel. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Semi-structural New Keynesian estimates of aggregate demand and supply with adaptive expectations provide inputs in the process. Sensitivity analysis confirms the Indian aggregate demand to be elastic and aggregate supply flat but subject to frequent shocks. The NIR is extracted from a model where optimization seeks to maintain subsistence consumption. Food price shocks reduce subsistence consumption and raise the willingness to work to protect it, reducing the NIR, but to the extent they raise inflation NIR rises. This dual role reflects transition in an economy that has a high growth potential if it can overcome structural bottlenecks. Since food price shocks are volatile, they raise the estimated volatility of all three unobserved variables, but improve precision of NIR estimation, better capture turning points that require a changed policy stance, and explain volatility of trend growth in emerging markets. Monetary policy was broadly contractionary and procyclical for the period under study. Using food inflation and its impact on NIR could improve policy decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using data for the 1985-1999 period, I present empirical evidence of the policy impact.

The study finds that the unrestricted electricity trade provision would save US$226 billion (US$9 billion per year) of electricity supply costs over the period (similar to$100 billion when discounted at 5% rate). The ratio of benefits, in the form of reduction of fuel and other operating costs, to increased costs of generation and interconnection investment would be more than 5:1. The provision would reduce regional power sector carbon dioxide emissions by 8%, mainly through substitution of coal based generation with hydro-based generation, although regional emissions would be well above current levels absent other policy interventions because of rapidly growing demand. To achieve these benefits, the region would need to add 95 GW of new cross-border transmission interconnection capacity; but at the same time it would avoid 36 GW of additional interconnection capacity between the regional grids within India.

In this article, we develop a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which unsecured firm credit arises from self-enforcing borrowing constraints, preventing an efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation which is a forward-looking variable. We argue that self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business-cycle dynamics. Adynamic complementarity between current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated sunspot shocks to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity, and output. We show that these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for around half of output volatility.","[Azariadis, Costas] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Azariadis, Costas; Wen, Yi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Kaas, Leo] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Wen, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Konstanz; Tsinghua University,"Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Wen, Yi/I-5756-2016","Wen, Yi/0000-0001-5658-1578",German Research Foundation [KA 1519/3],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The article is a substantially revised and extended version of our earlier working paper (FRB St. Louis Working Paper No. 2012-047A).

While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, group bonuses and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the gift; we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as bad aspects of job quality.

A switching regression model is employed to test the predictions of the real options theory regarding the uncertainty-investment relationship under different industry competition attributes. We find that the negative uncertainty sensitivity of investment is increased by industry concentration, but decreased by market share. The latter finding supports the view of strategic investment behavior of rival firms under uncertainty, rather than the erosion of option values by competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We perform an analysis on sub-stages from 3 January 2003 to 31 October 2013 to capture the price behaviour of both equity and commodity markets. Two financial crises indicators, VIX and CDS, are used to represent fear of a crisis. We find that correlations between commodity and equity markets are time-varying and highly volatile during a financial crisis. While sharing some common features, commodities cannot be considered a homogeneous asset class. Segmentation characteristics of commodity markets disappear in times of financial crises, reducing their substitutability as an investment portfolio for asset diversification purposes. Through our test for Granger causality, we find the existence of transmission during a financial crisis. Volatility spillover effect also plays a major role as transmission mechanisms. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, commodities decoupled from the VIX rather soon, and there is an increase in correlation with the CDS. In addition, we find the decoupling effect of most commodities show insignificant correlations with the Dow Jones, VIX and CDS after the Greek debt restructuring.","[Tzeng, Kae-Yih; Shieh, Joseph Chang Pying] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Tzeng, KY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",kytzeng0106@yahoo.com.tw,"曾, 凱逸/HZI-1920-2023","Tzeng, Kae-Yih/0000-0003-1797-535X",,,,,44,5,5,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition to the economic variables of GDP and real electricity prices, the model accounts for population, weather, and a stochastic underlying energy demand trend as a proxy for efficiency and human behaviour. The resulting income and price elasticities are informative for policy makers given the paucity of previous estimates for a region with particular political structures and economies subject to large shocks. In particular, the estimates allow for a sound assessment of the impact of energy related policies suggesting that if policy makers in the region wish to curtail future residential electricity consumption they would need to improve the efficiency of appliances and increase energy using awareness of consumers, possibly by education and marketing campaigns. Moreover, even if prices were raised the impact on curbing residential electricity growth in the region is likely to be very small given the low estimated price elasticities-unless, that is, prices were raised so high that expenditure on electricity becomes such a large proportion of income that the price elasticities increase (in absolute terms).

Using a nonlinear neoclassical growth model, we show that the difference in government spending effects between high- and low-debt environments depends on the wealth effect on labor supply and on whether the government uses taxes or spending to retire debt Because of interrelated state variables, structural VAR estimations conditioning on debt alone can fail to isolate debt-dependent effects. Also, uncertainty on when the government will conduct fiscal consolidations generates wide confidence bands for spending multipliers, further complicating efforts to estimate debt-dependent government spending effects.

For a class of three-player games, we derive equilibrium arrivals under the first-in-first-out (FIFO), last-in-first-out (LIFO), and service-in-random-order (SIRO) queue disciplines and compare these predictions to outcomes from a laboratory experiment. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that people arrive with greater dispersion when participating under the LIFO discipline, whereas they tend to arrive immediately under FIFO and SIRO. As a consequence, shorter waiting times are obtained under LIFO as compared to FIFO and SIRO. However, while our theoretical predictions admit higher welfare under LIFO, this is not recovered experimentally as the queue disciplines provide similar welfare outcomes.","[Breinbjerg, Jesper; Osterdal, Lars Peter] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Sebald, Alexander] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Sebald, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",jnb@sam.sdu.dk; alexander.sebald@econ.ku.dk; lpro@sam.sdu.dk,,"Sebald, Alexander/0000-0002-1386-9456; Osterdal, Lars Peter/0000-0002-6451-388X","Danish Council for Strategic Research; Danish Council for Independent Research \ Social Sciences [DFF-1327-00097, DFF-10-081368]",Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)); Danish Council for Independent Research \ Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"We thank Refael Hassin, Martin Osborne, as well as an associate editor and referee for very useful comments.

Modern growth has reduced the share of both the very unhappy and the perfectly happy. Lower happiness inequality is found both between and within countries, and between and within individuals. Our cross-country regression results suggest that the extension of various public goods helps to explain this greater happiness homogeneity.

There are, however, important physical characteristics in electricity markets, such as the constraints imposed by the physical transmission infrastructure, that have the potential to undermine competition and provide opportunities for market participants to exploit temporary positions of market power. In this paper, the regional market of Queensland, Australia is analysed. It is found that strategic behaviour by generators exists and is closely related to the occurrence of the kind of extreme price events that characterise many deregulated electricity markets. In addition, rebidding behaviour by base load generators immediately after extreme price events is shown to have negative impacts on the operation of the market. The key message is that promotion of competition in electricity markets can have undesirable consequences unless the regulatory policy is carefully designed to counter strategic behaviour by market participants.

This heterogeneous impact is observed only when the share of preferential imports increases, leading to a decline in tariff revenue. This makes countries which tend to heavily depend. on tariff revenue as a source of government funding more likely to reduce their MFN tariffs, which is also observed in the data. These results that are consistent with a mechanism operating through trade deflection and the associated loss of tariff revenue therefore lend support to the building bloc view of regionalism in countries applying high external tariffs before the agreement. In contrast, driven by other factors, the impact in low-tariff countries remains unclear with either insignificant effects or tariff substitution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examine reverse takeovers implemented in the Alternative Investment Market between 1999 and 2012, paying special attention to the differences between family and non-family target firms, as well as the impact of the financial crisis.We propose that family firms have a lower probability of accepting a reverse takeover (shell' firm), to avoid both diluting the ownership structure (loss of control) and new shareholders entering their firm. Our main findings show that the higher the percentage of ownership held by family holders, the lower the probability of their being the target firm in a reverse takeover.

It can be shown that news shocks cause larger economic fluctuations than unanticipated shocks of the same form and thus behave in a welfare-reducing manner. Given this, the paper explores how (optimal) monetary policy should be conducted. In line with earlier studies, the investigation of several Taylor-type interest rate rules shows that the lowest welfare losses can be achieved based on rules that respond to both contemporaneous and expected future macroeconomic conditions.

Against this background, we present the first integrated long-run scenario model of the Mozambican energy sector. Our model, which we name MOZLEAP, is calibrated on the basis of recently developed local energy statistics, demographic and urbanization trends as well as cross-country based GDP elasticities for biomass consumption,, sector structure, vehicle ownership and energy intensity. We develop four scenarios to evaluate the impact of the anticipated surge in natural resources exploration on aggregate trends in energy supply and demand, the energy infrastructure and economic growth in Mozambique. Our analysis shows that until 2030, primary energy production is likely to increase at least six-fold, and probably much more. This is roughly 10 times the expected increase in energy demand; most of the increase in energy production is destined for export. As a result, Mozambique may well become one of the leading global producers of natural gas and coal. We discuss the opportunities and challenges that this resource wealth poses for the country.

However, policy makers should be aware that assumptions relating to model structure can influence forecast results. We explore the sensitivity of forecasts to one aspect of model structure important in modelling developing economies: surplus agricultural labour. We outline a framework for modelling surplus agricultural labour that relies on average product remuneration. We embed this within a model of a developing economy (the Philippines) characterized by surplus agricultural labour. We compare the results of two forecasts that differ in their treatment of the agricultural labour market. In the first, the surplus labour theory is activated, establishing average product remuneration in agriculture. In the second, the surplus labour theory is not activated, creating a failure to recognize average product remuneration in agriculture. By comparing the two simulations, we show that failure to model the presence of average product remuneration, when it would be appropriate to do so, has an impact that would be material to economic planners, leading them to: under-estimate agricultural employment; over-estimate GDP growth; and, over-estimate important policy variables (like tax revenue) that are related to GDP growth.","[Mariano, Marc Jim M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laguna, Philippines; [Giesecke, James A.] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; Victoria University,"Mariano, MJM (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines Los Banos, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laguna, Philippines.",marcjim.mariano@gmail.com,,"Mariano, Marc Jim/0000-0002-3792-7112; Giesecke, James/0000-0002-7283-0551",,,,,18,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a large U.S. scanner data set on supermarket products and applying flexible regression methods, we find that on average prices decline as items age. This life cycle price change is often attributed to quality difference in the construction of CPI as items are replaced due to disappearance or during sample rotations. This introduces a systematic bias in the measurement of inflation. For our data we find that the life cycle bias leads to the underestimation of inflation by around 0.30 percentage points each year for the products examined.","[Melser, Daniel] Moodys Analyt, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Syed, Iqbal A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Syed, Iqbal A.] Univ New South Wales, CAER, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Syed, IA (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Syed, IA (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, CAER, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",i.syed@unsw.edu.au,,"Melser, Daniel/0000-0003-0452-818X; Syed, Iqbal/0000-0002-6521-7759","Australian Research Council [LP0347654, LP0667655]; Australian Research Council [LP0667655, LP0347654] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from Kenneth Clements, Erwin Diewert, Kevin Fox, Jan de Haan, and two anonymous referees, and financial support from the Australian Research Council (LP0347654 and LP0667655).

Although the limiting normal distribution has been established, the asymptotic variance formula has only been stated explicitly in the literature for the case of conditional homoskedasticity. By using the fact that the TS2SLS estimator is a function of reduced form and first-stage OLS estimators, we derive the variance of the limiting normal distribution under conditional heteroskedasticity. A robust variance estimator is obtained, which generalises to cases with more general patterns of variable (non-)availability. Stata code and some Monte Carlo results are provided in an Appendix.

The hypothesised link is tested using time-series analysis of 22 countries over the period 1961-2011. The degree of environmental impacts of economic activity is measured using ecological footprint (EF) per capita as explanatory variable, while real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and its quadratic and cubic forms are used as predictor variables in these countries. First, the EKC hypothesis is tested through examining the relationship between EF and GDP using linear, quadratic and cubic functions. Further, the long-run relationship between EF and GDP is investigated using a vector error correction model. It was found that there is a cointegrated relationship between the variables in almost all countries, which was statistically significant, and EKC supported in 10 countries. Additionally, almost all error correction terms are correct in sign and are significant, which implies that some percentage of disequilibria in EF in the previous year adjusts back to the long-run equilibrium in the current year. Therefore, an efficient trade-off between environmental protection and economic benefits should be taken, and EF should be reduced through changing consumption patterns, improving the efficiency of use of resources and cleaner technology choices.","[Uddin, Gazi A.; Alam, Khorshed; Gow, Jeff] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Gow, Jeff] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Southern Queensland; Stellenbosch University,"Uddin, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, West St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",gazi.uddin@usq.edu.au,"; Gow, Jeff/L-9647-2017","Alam, Khorshed/0000-0003-2232-0745; Gow, Jeff/0000-0002-5726-298X",Brazil Family Foundation,Brazil Family Foundation,This work is financially supported by the Brazil Family Foundation.

The aggregate values were then compared with the country's actual expenditures on sports facilities. The obtained results undermine the use of financing based entirely on public funds.","[Zawadzki, Krystian M.] Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Zawadzki, KM (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",kza@zie.pg.gda.pl,,"Zawadzki, Krystian/0000-0002-4483-3739",,,,,45,12,12,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

There is uncertainty about the state of the world. Candidates receive signals on the state and propose a policy to implement. There are two classes of voters: ideological, who are biased towards the policy proposed by the third candidate; and non-ideological, who want the policy implemented to correspond to the state of the world. We study two cases: (1) one in which the third candidate supports the most popular policy (in terms of the electorate's prior); (2) another one in which he supports the less popular policy. We obtain that the presence of a third candidate facilitates equilibria in which the two mainstream politicians make informative announcements, specially when the third candidate is biased towards the most popular policy. We also obtain that many of the informative equilibria are sustained by a coalition government, however the coalition is never between the two mainstream candidates. Last, we observe that in equilibrium, the third inflexible candidate has significant chances of winning office.","[Andina-Diaz, Ascension] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Andina-Díaz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",aandina@uma.es,"Díaz, Ascensión Andina/R-6592-2018","Díaz, Ascensión Andina/0000-0002-8629-8770","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2010-21624, ECO2011-26996]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ2011-8065]",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"I thank Nezih Guner, Guillermo Caruana and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

The latter procedure yields the equilibrium selected by Harsanyi and Selten's (1988) theory, which is hence here in contradiction with strategic stability (Kohlberg and Mertens, 1986). We find the Harsanyi-Selten solution to be in much better agreement with our data. Since fairness and bounded rationality seem to matter we discuss whether recent behavioral theories, in particular fairness theories and learning, might explain our findings. The fairness theories by Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), Charness and Rabin (2002), or Fehr and Schmidt (1999), when calibrated using experimental data on dictator- and ultimatum games, indeed predict that forward induction should play no role for our experiment and that the outside option should be chosen by all sufficiently selfish players. However, there is a multiplicity of fairness equilibria', some of which seem to be rejected because they require too many levels of reasoning. We show that learning theories based on naive priors could alternatively explain our results, but not that of closely related experiments.","[Balkenborg, Dieter] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Nagel, Rosemarie] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Nagel, Rosemarie] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Nagel, Rosemarie] BGSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of Exeter; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Barcelona School of Economics,"Balkenborg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.;Balkenborg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Streatham Court, Dept Econ, Exeter EX2 4PU, Devon, England.",d.g.balkenborg@ex.ac.uk,"Nagel, Rosemarie/C-6311-2013",,ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,45,4,7,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The argument, due to Hamilton (1975), is that a system of governments financing services with property taxes will produce an efficient allocation of housing and services if governments can implement zoning ordinances. In the model, when governments choose zoning along with taxes and services, there does not exist an equilibrium that is both efficient and locally stable. Moreover, there exists an equilibrium in which governments - over-zone and households - overconsume housing.

Bailout expectations can induce moral hazard in the form of excessive risk taking by banks. Systemic risk taxation induces banks to prefer uncorrelated investments, leading to lower systemic risk formation. Constructive ambiguity generates uncertainty about bailout prospects. However, systemic risk taxation also may inform banks about the regulator's concern for financial stability and thereby its bailout policy. This result leads to a trade-off between systemic risk taxation and constructive ambiguity and highlights the need to consider interdependence across policies when evaluating their effectiveness.

We find that playing music instead of doing sports fosters educational outcomes by about 0.1 standard deviations. Effects are stronger for girls, and for children from more highly educated families. Doing sports improves perceived health more strongly than playing music. Engaging in both activities, music and sports, improves educational outcomes by about 02 standard deviations and reduces smoking by about 10 percentage points compared to engaging in just one activity. Adolescents who engage in music spend less time watching TV or playing computer games, but more reading books. The robustness of the results is examined with respect to the identifying assumptions, including non-affected outcomes, a formal sensitivity analysis, and instrumental variable estimation.

Compared to the existing surveys on the subject, our paper is less technical and speaks to the applied economist with a solid basic understanding of econometric techniques who would like to use MTh estimation. Our framework of analysis is a generalized Roy model based on the potential outcomes framework, within which we define different treatment effects of interest, and review the well-known case of IV estimation with a discrete instrument resulting in a local average treatment effect (LATE). Turning to IV estimation with a continuous instrument, we demonstrate that the 2SLS estimator may be viewed as a weighted average of LATEs and discuss MTE estimation as an alternative and more informative way of exploiting a continuous instrument. We clarify the assumptions underlying the MTE framework, its relation to the correlated random coefficients model, and illustrate how the MTE estimation is implemented in practice.

Young firms, particularly startups, are an important source of job creation and that creation occurs in large part through fixed-term contracts. In contrast, most job destruction is due to small older firms that tend to use open-ended contracts. We also find that the share of fixed-term contracts increased substantially between 2002 and 2007 and that this increase was driven mainly by each successive cohort of startups. The severely deteriorating business climate in Portugal starting in the early 2000s coincides with the increased use of fixed-term contracts by firms.

Employing a random effects probit model and a propensity score matching with difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) approach and treating imports as endogenous in our measure of total factor productivity (TFP) (De Loecker 2007), we test the self-selection and learning-by-doing hypotheses. Our results show evidence of a bi-directional causal relationship between importing and productivity. Although importing firms tend to be more productive before entering the import market, once they start importing firms experience significant productivity gains for up to two years following entry. We also find evidence of learning effects following the decision to import, which is stronger when import starters source their products from high-income economies, import a wider variety of products and import products with a higher skill and technology content. A number of robustness checks confirm the learning effects of importing on TFP growth.","[Elliott, Robert J.

We analyze a two-period public goods model where later contributions can be based on better information, but delaying the mitigation effort is costly because of irreversible damages. Investments in technology affect the countries' timing of contributing. We show that countries have an incentive to provide cost-reducing technology as this can lead to an earlier contribution of other countries and can therefore reduce a country's burden of contributing to the public good.

In this respect, Japan provides an excellent opportunity to address the issue, as the country enacted major tax reforms during the long recession beginning in the early 1990s, not only abolishing STT in 1999, but also reducing the capital gains and dividend taxes in 2003. The present paper exploits these tax reform episodes and examines whether and how they affected stock return volatility. In so doing, it employs GARCH-type models using standard daily stock data, as well as HAR models based on realized volatility constructed from high-frequency, intraday data. The estimation results are consistent with the views that, in line with some earlier findings, the STT abolition in 1999 reduced volatility, and that the tax reforms in 2003 also reduced volatility through a cut in the dividend tax, but not in the capital gains tax.

Previous studies typically employed country averages and thus neglected possibly heterogeneous happiness effects between income groups. This paper addresses empirically the effects of government spending on subjective well-being of individuals belonging to different income groups. Our analysis is based on individual data from 25 European countries participating in the European Social Survey. In contrast to most previous studies we take account of the endogeneity between relative income position and reported life satisfaction by an instrumental variable approach. Our results suggest, first, that most government spending categories, including social protection, are on average negatively related to individual well-being. Secondly, estimated marginal effects of health, education and social protection spending at different income levels show that spending increases always have a stronger negative effect on high income groups' well-being than on low income groups' life satisfaction. For all government spending categories, marginal happiness effects of higher public spending are clearly negative for income groups at the top.","[Knoll, Bodo] Univ Bochum, Inst Econ, D-44799 Bochum, Germany; [Pitlik, Hans] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Ruhr University Bochum,"Pitlik, H (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",bodo.knoll@rub.de; hans.pitlik@wifo.ac.at,"Knoll, Bodo/AAE-9159-2020","Pitlik, Hans/0000-0001-8124-1110",,,,,38,9,9,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2016,43,3,,,,,533,557,,10.1007/s10663-015-9304-4,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR9PW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380229600004,0

The main distinction between the two frameworks can be formulated as whether agents care about future self-control costs: dual selves do, while quasi-hyperbolic discounters do not. The dual-self model is applied to a bargaining game with alternating proposals where players negotiate over an infinite stream of payoffs, and it is shown that, in subgame-perfect equilibrium, the first proposer's payoff is unique and agreement is immediate. By contrast, Lu (2016) shows that with quasi-hyperbolic discounters, a multiplicity of payoffs and delay can arise in equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The agreements have contributed to the growth of regional trade flows positively, but to a limited extent due to a significant trade diversion to non-member countries. We argue that the incentive of trade with a large nonmember country tends to be more than that with a small regional member because of limited demand, scale and industrial activities. Though the trade barriers have declined substantially in the Pacific, high trade costs due to poor logistics, bureaucratic regulations and weak institutions compared to the neighbours have remained the binding constraints for deriving potential benefits from such agreements. Collective negotiations for external trade and developing common logistics and institutions for facilitating trade among the members would encourage regional trade flow and minimize asymmetric gains among the members.","[Maiti, Dibyendu] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, North Campus, New Delhi 110007, India; [Kumar, Sunil] Univ South Pacific, Sch Econ, Suva, Fiji",Delhi School of Economics; University of Delhi; University of the South Pacific,"Maiti, D (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, North Campus, New Delhi 110007, India.",mdibyendu@yahoo.com,,"Maiti, Dibyendu/0000-0003-4187-7047","University of the South Pacific under strategic research theme on Trade Creation, Regional Growth and Development: The Role of Regional Trade Agreement in the South Pacific Islands''","University of the South Pacific under strategic research theme on Trade Creation, Regional Growth and Development: The Role of Regional Trade Agreement in the South Pacific Islands''","We would like to acknowledge research support provided by the University of the South Pacific to carry out this research under strategic research theme on Trade Creation, Regional Growth and Development: The Role of Regional Trade Agreement in the South Pacific Islands''.

In this article, we augment the benchmark model with the real exchange rate of the Swiss franc vis-a-vis currencies of its 24 trading partners, while keeping the rest of model specification intact. We are interested in investigating the relationship between the common latent factor, representing the Swiss business cycle, and the real exchange rate. We explore the temporal relationship between these two variables by varying the time lag with which the real exchange rate enters the factor model by recording the magnitude and statistical significance of the factor loading coefficient in the equation pertaining to the real exchange rate variable. Our main conclusion is that the fluctuations in the exchange rate start influencing real economy after 1 month and their effect is practically over after 13 months.

A decision maker (DM) faces an objective long-run probability distribution p over several variables (including the action taken by previous DMs). The DM is characterized by a subjective causal model, represented by a directed acyclic graph over the set of variable labels. The DM attempts to fit this model to p, resulting in a subjective belief that distorts p by factorizing it according to the graph via the standard Bayesian network formula. As a result of this belief distortion, the DM's evaluation of actions can vary with their long-run frequencies. Accordingly, I define a personal equilibrium notion of individual behavior. The framework enables simple graphical representations of causal-attribution errors (such as coarseness or reverse causation), and provides tools for checking rationality properties of the DM's behavior. I demonstrate the framework's scope of applications with examples covering diverse areas, from demand for education to public policy.

Specifically, the authors highlight the different roles played by the changing oil shocks with respect to the short-term and long-term components regarding oil market volatility. The results indicate that a global demand shock is the only factor found not only to be positive but to also significantly increase long- and short-term oil volatility in the full sample. This is consistent with a classic host of research that advocates that global demand dominates the oil market. However, since 2004, impacts of other oil shocks have been significantly weakened or even reversed. For example, the speculative demand shock has helped to stabilize long-term oil volatility during the post-2004 period. The results also suggest the existence of asymmetric impacts on short-term oil volatility, particularly for shocks from oil supply, oil-specific demand and oil speculative demand.","[Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll RD, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yimin] Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Beihang University,"Yin, LB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll RD, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yinlibowsxbb@126.com,"Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017; Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401193, 71371022]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under project No. 71401193 and No. 71371022 and the Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.,,48,12,14,1,21,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 22,2016,10,,,,,,,,201620.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-20,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DV7NE,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383122300001,0

It considers oligopolistic homogeneous good markets and duopolistic and triopolistic markets under product differentiation (PD) (quantity and price competition). In a two-stage game, firms invest in cost-reducing innovation (with and without mergers) and then compete in output/prices. It is found that in homogeneous good markets, all possible mergers generate efficiency gains, and that these are most significant when R&D spillovers are very low or very high. Efficiency gains increase with the number of insiders and generally decrease with the number of outsiders. With PD, in most cases, the merger generates efficiency gains when spillovers and/or PD are sufficiently high. With PD, efficiency gains increase with spillovers, but may increase or decrease with the level of PD. The implications of the results for the relationship between competition and innovation outputs and for merger policy are discussed.","[Atallah, Gamal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Atallah, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",gatallah@uottawa.ca,"Atallah, Gamal/C-1634-2009","Atallah, Gamal/0000-0002-2287-7597",,,,,54,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The crisis has also shown that fluctuations in risk premia can be dramatic. We investigate the relevance of the net international investment position for sovereign risk perception and the role of market uncertainty in this relation. Furthermore, we ask whether the composition of net external assets, in terms of debt and equity instruments, is relevant in explaining sovereign risk premia and their fluctuations in time. We find that both public debt and NIIP are subject to fluctuations in risk premia; the external variable is more sensitive to the uncertainty of future expectations, and net external debt is what drives this result. Net foreign debt liabilities are associated with a lower government bond yield spread when market optimism justifies their presence with high future growth patterns; however, it becomes an important risk factor for sovereigns when global uncertainty increases and the capacity to repay foreign debt becomes a concern. Portfolio equity and FDI are related to sovereign risk in a stable manner, while a given amount of net external debt can be associated with government yield spread spikes as high as 4 %.","[Bianchi, Benedetta] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Bianchi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland.",bianchib@tcd.ie,,,Irish Research Council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",I thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

This article analyzes the impact of a flipped undergraduate economics course that leverages an existing suite of online lectures by Khan Academy. The study employs a quasiexperimental design to evaluate the impact of two different flipped treatments on an undergraduate microeconomics principles final exam. Student achievement is compared for students in (i) a traditional undergraduate course; (ii) a complemented (or partially flipped) classroom including traditional mini lectures complemented with online video lectures assigned as homework; and (iii) a flipped classroom. Results suggest that students in both of the flipped courses scored between 4 and 14 percentage points higher on set of common questions and a cumulative final exam.,"[Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Caviglia-Harris, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.;Caviglia-Harris, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu,,"Caviglia-Harris, Jill/0000-0001-7860-4857",Franklin P.

On the demand side, sluggish world import growth may adversely affect individual countries' economic growth as it limits opportunities for their exports. On the supply side, slower trade may diminish the scope for productivity growth through increasing specialization and diffusion of technologies.

To account for the endogeneity of import decisions, we pursue an IV strategy that utilizes instruments for import costs connected to intermediate input import tariffs, exchange rates, and firm differences in fixed trade costs. We find that firms that expanded their intermediate input imports expanded the volume and scope of their exports. Further, we find that the benefit of imported inputs differed along a number of dimensions including initial trade status, import source country, export destination, firm ownership, and industry R&D intensity. Although increased imports of intermediates boosted exports by all firms, we find that the effects were largest when they were purchased by private firms or firms that started out as non traders. In addition, intermediate inputs from the higher-income G7 countries were especially helpful in facilitating firm exports to the presumably more-demanding G7 export markets. Taken together, these results suggest that product upgrading facilitated by technology or quality embedded in imported inputs helped Chinese firms to increase the scale and breadth of their participation in export markets.

This paper evaluates the financial effects of an increase in the minimum retirement age in countries where a Notional Defined Contribution system exists. We show that such a reform produces a positive effect on the financial situation of the pension system (by generating surpluses or by reducing deficits) in the short and in the medium run, but it becomes completely ineffective in the long run. This result implies that in countries where the pension system is sufficiently neutral such a reform is not appropriate to solve the problem of population ageing which is a long-run problem.","[Magnani, Riccardo] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Magnani, Riccardo] Sorbonne Paris Cite, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Magnani, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.;Magnani, R (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Paris Cite, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",riccardo.magnani@univ-paris13.fr,,"Magnani, Riccardo/0000-0003-0001-5205",,,,,24,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,JUL,2016,67,3,,,,,578,602,,10.1111/meca.12113,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DN6YX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377223600005,0

The difference is due to a hidden instability (i.e., an exact cancellation of an explosive autoregressive root) that is a property of the full-information equilibrium but not present in the partial-information equilibrium. Due to the multitude of potential equilibria, we use least-squares learnability as a refinement mechanism. We find that models with complete information revelation are not least-squares learnable, while information structures that do not fully reveal the underlying shocks are learnable. We show that learnability relates to the informational stability properties of an equilibrium, whereby an equilibrium is said to be informationally unstable if it vanishes when information is slightly perturbed. We present application to a model with productivity shocks and nominal rigidities. In both cases we show that equilibria with complete information are informationally unstable, and thus not learnable; while equilibria that preserve incomplete information are informationally stable and learnable.

We relate this 'preference for belief consonance' to a variety of other constructs that have been explored by economists, including identity, ideology, homophily, and fellow-feeling. We review different possible explanations for why people care about others' beliefs and propose that the preference for belief consonance leads to a range of disparate phenomena, including motivated belief-formation, proselytizing, selective exposure to media, avoidance of conversational minefields, pluralistic ignorance, belief-driven clustering, intergroup belief polarization, and conflict.

He was among the first economists to recognise the growing importance of intra-industry trade and presented his hypothesis that the more similar the per capita income levels of countries, the more they tend to trade with each other. This observation has since become one of the main pillars of modern trade theory. The present paper assesses the empirical validity of the Linder hypothesis in the Visegrad countries. Using a variant of the gravity model, it finds that when controlling for other factors, the Visegrad countries tend to trade more with countries with similar per capita income levels than with significantly richer or poorer countries. This observation is consistent with the Linder hypothesis. OLS regressions, Tobit regressions, and robustness checks all support the hypothesis.","[Grancay, Martin; Grancay, Nora] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Economics Bratislava; Lithuanian Sports University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Grancay, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin_grancay@yahoo.com; nora.grancay@gmail.com; Jolita.Vveinhardt@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Grancay, Martin/N-9889-2014","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Grancay, Martin/0000-0002-7006-147X","Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [017EU-4/2015]","Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This research was funded by the Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic (Grant No. 017EU-4/2015).

KEYNES; MONEY; EMPLOYMENT; POLICY; CURRENCY,"In recent years negative nominal interest rates came to the attention of a wider audience as one instrument to overcome the lower zero bound to conventional monetary policy. Modern proponents trace the origin of the proposal back to Silvio Gesell, a largely forgotten German autodidactic scholar of the interwar period, whose work provides valuable insight into heterodox late nineteenth- and twentieth-century economic thinking. Against this backdrop, the present article provides a comprehensive review of Gesell's life and social economy, firmly linking him to German anarchism of the interwar period. It suggests that Gesell not only provided a monetary theory of interest, but put forward an independent monetary theory of economic crisis that is essential in understanding the historical origins of depreciative currency proposals. Moreover, the article maintains that Gesell's monetary theory of interest can be seen as the missing link between heterodox economics, The General Theory, and anarchist economic theory.","[Ilgmann, Cordelius] Thuringian Minist Econ Affairs Sci & Digital Soc, Erfurt, Germany",,"Ilgmann, C (通讯作者)，Thuringian Minist Econ Affairs Sci & Digital Soc, Erfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,98,9,10,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The subject of the analysis is the relationship defining equilibrium in the domestic money market, i.e. when money demand corresponds to the money supply in the economy. The main objective is to determine whether such a long-term equilibrium relationship exists by verifying this assumption on real data for the Czech economy. The Johansen cointegration approach is applied for modelling the money demand function including four domestic macroeconomic indicators: money supply, price level, gross domestic product, and interest rate. The results suggest that the level of real money supply fluctuated around the estimated long-run equilibrium value in the analysed period 2000-2013.","[Juriova, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Juriová, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jana.juriova@vsb.cz,,,Student Grant Competition of VSB - Technical University of Ostrava [SP2014/131],Student Grant Competition of VSB - Technical University of Ostrava,This paper was funded by the Student Grant Competition of VSB - Technical University of Ostrava within the Project No. SP2014/131.,,23,2,2,1,7,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

When a firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in the product market. The feedback between employment and product market conditions generates multiple equilibriaand the possibility of self-fulfilling fluctuationsif differences in shopping behavior between employed and unemployed are large enough. Evidence on spending, shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case.","[Kaplan, Greg] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kaplan, Greg; Menzio, Guido] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Menzio, Guido] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,31,65,74,1,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

This holds with a risk-neutral agent who is protected by limited liability as well as with a risk-averse agent and unlimited liability.

Thus, the income loss by over-education (horizontal mismatch) is overestimated if it is estimated ignoring horizontal mismatch (over-education). This overestimation problem is particularly prevalent for workers at low and near-median deciles of the conditional income distribution.

We find that the elitist university is more likely to open a branch campus.

One possible explanation for overbidding is that participants in these experiments may try to avoid regret induced by the knowledge of winning bids in case they do not win these auctions. Such considerations may drive bidders to bid aggressively in first-price auctions. We test whether differences in how auction outcomes are revealed produces systematic differences in bidding. In our design, where individuals bid against pre-programmed computers, differences in revelation of winning bids, does not produce significant treatment differences.

Is this all due to differences in what students bring with them to school--socioeconomic background, cultural factors, and the like? Or do school systems make a difference? This essay argues that differences in features of countries' school systems, and in particular their institutional structures, account for a substantial part of the cross-country variation in student achievement. It first documents the size and cross-test consistency of international differences in student achievement. Next, it uses the framework of an education production function to provide descriptive analysis of the extent to which different factors of the school system, as well as factors beyond the school system, account for cross-country achievement differences. Finally, it covers research that goes beyond descriptive associations by addressing leading concerns of bias in cross-country analysis. The available evidence suggests that differences in expenditures and class size play a limited role in explaining cross-country achievement differences, but that differences in teacher quality and instruction time do matter. This suggests that what matters is not so much the amount of inputs that school systems are endowed with, but rather how they use them. Correspondingly, international differences in institutional structures of school systems such as external exams, school autonomy, private competition, and tracking have been found to be important sources of international differences in student achievement.","[Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Ctr Econ Educ, Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Econ, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Woessmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Ctr Econ Educ, Munich, Germany.;Woessmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Econ, Munich, Germany.",woessmann@ifo.de,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,76,102,129,4,38,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

These include the often-significant cost of lost time. This paper thus aims to estimate the potential economic welfare benefit of reducing public office waiting times. Based on data from Johannesburg, Lagos and Addis Ababa, we show that a one-hour reduction in waiting time improves welfare by 66-74% of the average local wage. High-income earners, college graduates and private-sector employees enjoy higher gains. Moreover, we note that the proxies currently used to quantify time-saving benefits diverge significantly from the rate at which individuals substitute time for money. Our analysis also indicated a substantial delay-induced citywide efficiency loss. Introducing public-private partnership and charging premium fees for faster service delivery are justifiable both on grounds of equity and efficiency.","[Wondemu, Kifle] OSAN, African Dev Bank, 01 BP 1387, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire",African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Wondemu, K (通讯作者)，OSAN, African Dev Bank, 01 BP 1387, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire.",kiflea@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Very little empirical evidence exists, however, on this newly formed market and even less on the characteristics that lead to donor success. This article therefore explores the determinants of online sperm donors' selection success, which leads to the production of offspring via informal donation. We find that donor age and income play a significant role in donor success as measured by the number of times selected, even though there is no requirement for ongoing paternal investment. Donors with less extroverted and lively personality traits who are more intellectual, shy and systematic are more successful in realizing offspring via informal donation.

Using a relatively long sample of daily observations, we examine whether the impact of trading volume on returns and volatility of futures contracts can be time-varying and dependent on the market condition. We differentiate the market condition based on the slope of the forward curve into backwardation and contango. The results indicate that trading volume and returns are positively related when the market is in backwardation and negatively related when the market is in contango. In addition, the positive relation between changes in trading volume and volatility of futures contracts seem to be stronger when the market is in backwardation than when it is in contango. Finally, the results indicate that, to a certain extent, trade participation and trading activities of agents in energy futures markets can be explained by the slope of the forward curve which reflects the market condition and sentiment.

Resource rich developing countries (RRDCs), on the other hand, face substantial development needs and tight external borrowing constraints. By relaxing these constraints and providing a key financing source for public investment, resource windfalls might then be associated with current account deficits or at least low surpluses. In this paper, we develop a neoclassical model with private and public investment and several pervasive features in RRDCs, including absorptive capacity constraints, inefficiencies in investment, borrowing constraints, and capital scarcity. We use the model to study the role of investment and these frictions in shaping the current account dynamics under windfalls. Since consumption and investment decisions are optimal, the model also serves to analyze current account norms (benchmarks). We apply the model to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and discuss how our results can be used to inform external sustainability analyses in RRDCs. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In every period workers decide whether to actively participate in the labor market and if so how many hours to work on the job. Balanced growth requires that the job technology is complementary with the worker's total labor input on the job, which is jointly determined by his skill and his working hours. Since lower skilled workers can supply longer hours, we show that the equilibrium features positive assortative matching (higher skilled workers are assigned to better jobs) only if differences in consumption are small relative to differences in worker skills. When the pace of technological progress accelerates, wage inequality increases and workers participate less often in the labor market but supply longer hours on the job. This mechanism can explain why, as male wage inequality has increased in the US, labor force participation of male workers of different skills has fallen while their working hours have increased.

We employ three second-generation heterogeneous linear panel models as well as recently developed nonlinear panel estimation techniques allowing for cross-sectional dependence. The empirical results show that population density and affluence increase emissions and energy intensity while renewable energy seems to be dormant in these emerging economies, but non-renewable energy increases both CO2 emissions and energy intensity. In addition, openness significantly reduces both pollutant emissions and energy intensity whereas urbanization significantly increases energy intensity, but it is insignificant in increasing emissions. This maybe, in part, due to the recent increasing trend in adopting cleaner technologies in these increasingly urbanized developing economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For an ambiguity averse insurer, as ambiguity increases, the optimal menu of contracts moves toward the one that equalizes the profits earned by the insurer from the two types of consumers. The insurer may offer the same menu of contracts even if her prior belief changes.

Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management, and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition intensifies, monopsonistic underincentivization of low-skill agents first decreases and then gives way to growing overincentivization of high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in incentives but may generate other distortions.","[Benabou, Roland] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Benabou, Roland] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Benabou, Roland] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Benabou, Roland] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Paris, France; [Benabou, Roland] Inst Study Labor IZA, Berlin, Germany; [Tirole, Jean] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Tirole, Jean] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Toulouse, France",Princeton University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Paris, France.;Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Berlin, Germany.",,,,European Research Council [249429]; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; Institute for Advanced Studies in Toulouse; Center on Sustainable Finance and Responsible Investment (Chaire Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable) at Institut d'Economie Industrielle-R; European Research Council (ERC) [249429] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); Institute for Advanced Studies in Toulouse; Center on Sustainable Finance and Responsible Investment (Chaire Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable) at Institut d'Economie Industrielle-R; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Daron Acemoglu, Sylvain Chassang, Wouter Dessein, Xavier Gabaix, Thomas Mariotti, Wolfgang Pesendorfer, Canice Prendergast, David Sraer, Lars Stole, Michael Waldmann, Glen Weyl, Phil Reny (the editor), three referees, and participants in conferences and seminars at Maastricht University, Toulouse School of Economics-Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, Centre for Economic Policy Research, the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute, Princeton University, Columbia Graduate School of Business, Berkeley Graduate School of Business, Chicago Graduate School of Business, the Institute for Advanced Study, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Yale University, the Econometric Society winter meetings, and the Association Francaise de Sciences Economiques for helpful comments.

The volatility spillover causality tests generally rule out country-to-oil effects, suggesting unidirectional volatility transmissions from oil prices to emerging stock markets, particularly in the case of the net exporting nations of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE. We also observe significant volatility spillovers from oil prices to emerging importers during the post-global financial crisis period. The findings suggest that the information on oil market volatility combined with the magnitude of volatility spillovers can be utilized towards modeling and monitoring volatility shocks in emerging stock markets.","[Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik USEK, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon; [Demirer, Riza] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Bouri, E (通讯作者)，Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik USEK, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon.",eliebouri@usek.edu.lb,"Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020; Demirer, Riza/D-2981-2015; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015","Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; Demirer, Riza/0000-0002-1840-8085; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027",,,,,38,27,28,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In particular, weak institutions may reduce the returns to product quality, harming domestic welfare and making it attractive to export to countries with strong institutions where quality is better rewarded. We model this alternative story as to why the good apples are shipped out and explore whether exporting ameliorates the problems created by weak institutions. We find that, instead, because home prices do not reflect the marginal value of quality, access to developed markets can be welfare reducing. Specifically, there are always export prices such that total welfare (and not just consumer welfare) is harmed by exporting. Furthermore, if the domestic price equilibrates to the export price, then the marginal unit exported reduces total welfare. Exporting can even reduce producer surplus, leading to a contraction of the export industry; although, welfare can decrease even if production of the exported good increases. Thus, our results reinforce the importance of strengthening institutions to help the development of economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On empirical grounds Fama rejects bubbles by referring to the lack of reliable evidence that price declines are predictable. However, this argument cannot be used to rule out rational bubbles because such bubbles do not necessarily imply return predictability, and return predictability of the kind documented by Fama does not rule out rational bubbles. On data samples that include the 1990s, there is evidence of an explosive component in stock market valuation ratios, consistent with a rational bubble.","[Engsted, Tom] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Engsted, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tengsted@creates.au.dk,,,CREATES (Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series) - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Danish Council of Independent Research [DFF-4003-00022],CREATES (Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series) - Danish National Research Foundation; Danish Council of Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"This research is supported by CREATES (Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series) funded by the Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF78), and the Danish Council of Independent Research (DFF-4003-00022).

We examine a unique dataset of automobile purchasers in China to investigate the extent to which skewed sex ratios influence expenditure decisions for this highly visible commodity. Using a triple difference approach, we show that unmarried male consumers who face an unfavorable sex ratio purchase more expensive, luxury vehicles than their married peers. Lower income borrowers and those residing in regions with the worst sex ratios exhibit the largest relative degree of conspicuous consumption. In addition to the direct cost of consumption signaling, we demonstrate that this behavior generates negative externalities in the form of lower average fuel economy and higher average vehicle weight. As it has worsened sex ratios, status competition and the associated negative repercussions we identify represent unintended consequences of China's one child policy.

The equilibrium is either a state of perpetual peace where there are concessions but no repression or a state of repressive equilibrium that can lead to civil wars. At the lowest levels of political competition, a move towards open electoral participation decreases the ability of the state to use repression to limit challengers, increasing the likelihood of war. At higher levels, an increase in competition decreases the probability of war by increasing concessions to the rebel group. Increasing concessions makes war less likely because it decreases the spoils of war and provides one explanation for the non-monotonicity found between probability of civil war and democracy. We test the prediction of this non-linearity using the technique in [Hansen (2000). Sample Splitting and Threshold Estimation.

We find that the introduction of an insurance mandate and the expansion of Medicaid which are at the core of the ACA increase the insurance take-up rate of workers to almost universal coverage but decrease capital accumulation, labor supply and aggregate output. Penalties for not having insurance as well as subsidies to assist low income individuals' purchase of insurance via health insurance market places do reduce the adverse selection problem in private health insurance markets and do counteract the crowding-out effect of the Medicaid expansion. The redistributional measures embedded in the ACA result in welfare gains for low income individuals in poor health and welfare losses for high income individuals in good health.

In addition, the TARP affected the competitive conduct of unsupported banks after the program stopped in the fourth quarter of 2009. Loan rates were higher, and the risk premium required by depositors was lower for banks with higher bailout expectations. The interest margins of unsupported banks increased in the immediate aftermath of the TARP disbursement but not after 2010.

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are employed to benchmark evolutionary models. The results reveal that the GEP technique outperforms traditional statistical techniques in predicting oil prices. Further, the GEP model outperforms the NN and the ARIMA models in terms of the mean squared error, the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error. Finally, the GEP model also has the highest explanatory power as measured by the R-squared statistic. The results of this study have important implications for both theory and practice.

We employ a new index that accounts for the enforcement related component of the patent system and the Ginarte and Park (1997) index of patent regulatory strength. We thus include two crucial elements of a national patent system, the de jure position relating to book law and IPR regulations, and the de facto position relating to IPR enforcement.

It shows that, in a monopolistic competitive environment with differentiated capital intensive goods, labor liberalization is more likely to come about in the societies that have more taste for variety. Moreover, in a host country with a strong preference for variety, workers and capital owners may share the same positive stance toward labor liberalization. It follows that the latter is impossible in a perfect competitive environment. Finally, in a dynamic inter-temporal setting with strategic voters, it demonstrates that the median voter is willing to accept fewer immigrants in the first period, in order to preserve her domestic political influence in the next period because of the naturalization of immigrants. In this way, the median voter maximizes her gains from immigration by accepting more immigrants in total.","[Qirjo, Dhimitri] SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, 329 Au Sable Hall,101 Broad St, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Plattsburgh,"Qirjo, D (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Finance, 329 Au Sable Hall,101 Broad St, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA.",dqirj001@fiu.edu,,"Qirjo, Dhimitri/0000-0002-9073-6921",,,,,51,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

First, price-matching diminishes firms' incentives to lower prices to attract consumers who have no search costs. Second, for consumers with positive search costs, price-matching lowers the marginal benefit of search, inducing them to accept higher prices. Finally, price-matching can lead to asymmetric equilibria where one firm runs fewer sales and both firms tend to offer smaller discounts than in a symmetric equilibrium. Price increases grow in the proportion of consumers who invoke price-matching guarantees and in the level of equilibrium asymmetry.","[Yankelevich, Aleksandr] Michigan State Univ, Quello Ctr, CAS, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Vaughan, Brady] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 1208, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Michigan State University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Yankelevich, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Quello Ctr, CAS, 404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",alyank@msu.edu; bvaughan@wustl.edu,,,"Center for Research in Economics and Strategy, in the Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis","Center for Research in Economics and Strategy, in the Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis","The authors would like to thank Carmen Astorne-Figari, Rohan Dutta, Philip Dybvig, Maarten Janssen, Dmitri Kuksov, Stephanie Lau, Filippo Massari, John Nachbar, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, Bruce C.

This is the first study to be carried out on the effects of private schooling in primary education in Italy. Our analysis uses an Instrumental Variables methodology to test the effectiveness of the voucher plan implemented by the regional government-the Region. The results show that, on average, there is no statistically significant 'private school effect'. However, when exploring the potential heterogeneity of such effect, we did find that attending a private school is associated with higher performance in standardized test scores for two categories of pupils: immigrants and those from a relatively disadvantaged socio-economic background. From a policy perspective, we believe that private schools at primary level can serve disadvantaged pupils better and so help to improve equal opportunities throughout the entire educational system.

We employ an adaptive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method with asymmetric Laplace distribution to study six daily Dow Jones Industrial stocks. The proposed model captures asymmetric risk through market beta and volume coefficients, which change discretely between regimes. Moreover, they are driven by market information and various quantile levels. This study finds that abnormal volume has significantly negative effects on excess stock returns under low quantile levels; however, there are significantly positive effects under high quantile levels. The evidence indicates that each market beta varies with different quantile levels, capturing different states of market conditions.","[Chen, Cathy W.

Focusing on groups of counties ranked by their poverty rates, we show that gains in life expectancy at birth have actually been relatively equally distributed between rich and poor areas. Analysts who have concluded that inequality in life expectancy is increasing have generally focused on life expectancy at age 40 to 50. This observation suggests that it is important to examine trends in mortality for younger and older ages separately. Turning to an analysis of age-specific mortality rates, we show that among adults age 50 and over, mortality has declined more quickly in richer areas than in poorer ones, resulting in increased inequality in mortality. This finding is consistent with previous research on the subject. However, among children, mortality has been falling more quickly in poorer areas with the result that inequality in mortality has fallen substantially over time. We also show that there have been stunning declines in mortality rates for African Americans between 1990 and 2010, especially for black men. Finally we offer some hypotheses about causes for the results we see, including a discussion of differential smoking patterns by age and socioeconomic status.","[Currie, Janet] Princeton Univ, Econ & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Schwandt, Hannes] Univ Zurich, Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",Princeton University; University of Zurich,"Currie, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Econ & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jcurrie@princeton.edu; hannes.schwandt@uzh.ch,,,Princeton Center for Translational Research on Aging [2P30AG024928]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Princeton Center for Translational Research on Aging; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Anne Case, Angus Deaton, Pascaline Dupas, Ilyana Kuziemko, Ronald Lee, Kenneth Wachter, Amelie Wuppermann as well as seminar participants at Princeton, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Fundacao Getulio Vargas Sao Paulo, University of Bergen, University of Bonn, Berkeley, and the Chicago Fed for comments.

We develop a Tikhonov regularization approach with an efficient numerical algorithm to recover the risk neutral drift term of the volatility (or variance) process. In contrast to most existing literature, we do not assume that the drift term has any special structure. As such, our algorithm applies to calibration of general stochastic volatility models. An extensive numerical analysis is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. Interestingly, our empirical study reveals that the risk neutral variance processes recovered from market prices of options on S&P 500 index and EUR/USD exchange rate are indeed linearly mean-reverting.

I argue that EBC1 models are part of the evolution of modern macroeconomics that has classical roots dating back to the 1920s.

However, the assignment of poor outcomes to the divorce itself fails to take into account relationship quality and heterogeneity in place before or in the absence of union dissolution. I explore the link between heterogeneity of relationship quality and investments in children by showing that women who report less satisfaction in their relationships spend less time reading with their children. I test various theoretical mechanisms by which we would expect women to decrease their investments in a child using information about the match including reported argument frequency and whether the union dissolves. The results suggest that subjective measures tell a more complete story about investments in children than indicated by future union status, argument frequency or parental quality.","[Fletcher, Erin K.] Lafayette Coll, Simon Ctr 100, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Lafayette College,"Fletcher, EK (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Simon Ctr 100, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",fletchee@lafayette.edu,"Fletcher, Erin/KCJ-8792-2024",,,,,,21,1,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This realisation is fuelling concern about the youth employment challenge. However, these discussions often lack context, owing to the absence of labour market data and analysis. This article remedies that gap through an analysis of the macroeconomics of the youth employment problem in the low and lower middle income countries of SSA. This analysis concludes that the youth employment problem is just a subset of the overall employment challenges in SSA, which stem from the sluggish pace of the demographic transition-which is why so many youth are coming into the labour market in the first place-combined with slow development of a modern, export-oriented enterprise sector, which leaves the majority of youth entering the labour force no employment option except household farms and firms. In these segments, earnings and productivity are usually low. This has resulted in a large gap between the aspirations of youth (and their parents) and the economic opportunities available. A recognition of realities of the current employment structure and the limited prospects for a major change could bring better focus to current youth employment strategies and illuminate the most promising directions for public and private interventions. In particular, strategies should focus more on how to raise productivity and earnings in the sector where most of the labour force works, instead of just concentrating on the urban wage employment sector.","[Fox, Louise] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thomas, Alun] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; International Monetary Fund,"Fox, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fox.louise@outlook.com,,,African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"The authors are grateful to the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) for providing financial support for the preparation and presentation of this article at the AERC Biannual Research Workshop, Lusaka, Zambia, December 2014.",,23,22,22,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Therefore, I start by identifying the main lines of criticism raised against theoretical economics in the aftermath of the post-2008 global economic crisis: namely, the voices criticizing economics for its unrealistic models, excessive mathematization, and overconfidence in its theoretical claims. First, I show that these issues are interconnected and should be jointly analyzed. Next, I investigate these lines of critique from the perspective provided by the latest achievements in the philosophy of economics (e.g., studies on the epistemic role of economic models). Taking this perspective reinforces some allegations against economics (e.g., these voices accusing economists of treating economic laws as universal laws of nature) and makes some criticisms more nuanced (e.g., the issue of unrealistic assumptions). I conclude by stating that such a methodological perspective is necessary in critically apprising the recent critique of economics.","[Hardt, Lukasz] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Hardt, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",,"Hardt, Łukasz/N-2949-2017","Hardt, Łukasz/0000-0001-6542-5833",National Science Center of Poland [2011/01/D/HS4/03829],"National Science Center of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",Lukasz Hardt is a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Warsaw (Poland).

This literature is relevant to the larger literature on intergenerational income mobility since correlation in intergenerational labor market outcomes is one of the potential factors contributing to the intergenerational correlation of permanent incomes. In this paper, we consider the time spent in unemployment by both sons and daughters, while accounting for the potential endogeneity of education. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia data, we find evidence of a positive correlation of labor market outcomes between fathers and sons and, to a lesser extent, between mothers and daughters. In addition, the results reveal a significant relationship between parents' and children's education levels, indicating that there is an indirect association of parental education with their children's labor market outcomes through education.","[Herault, Nicolas; Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hérault, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",nherault@unimelb.edu.au; g.kalb@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012; Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390; Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608","Faculty of Economics and Commerce, The University of Melbourne","Faculty of Economics and Commerce, The University of Melbourne","This research was commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) under the Social Policy Research Services Agreement (2005-2009) with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.

I consider one of these fundamentals, institutions, and analyze whether they are malleable by a contemporary economic variable, globalization. The globalization I consider is of production through multinational corporations. Using the recently available data on institutional quality for almost all countries, I show institutional quality is higher with a greater FDI presence in developing countries. Nevertheless, there is no statistically significant effect on the same institutional variables in developed countries. By some measures, the income-gap between the rich and poor countries has worsened in the post-1950 period, and a consensus has emerged that poor institutions are to be blamed. A policy of encouraging FDI is likely to have the additional effect of improving institutions in developing countries and may have a greater potential to reduce income gaps than has been realized.

The resulting game is a form of multiplayer war of attrition. Our key finding is that, consistent with theoretical predictions, when voters are ex ante heterogeneous in terms of the intensity of their preferences the conclave leads to efficiency gains relative to simple majority voting.

Among the early supporters of the expected utility hypothesis in the von Neumann-Morgenstern version were Milton Friedman and Leonard Jimmie Savage, both based at the University of Chicago, and Jacob Marschak, a leading member of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics. Paul Samuelson of MIT was initially a severe critic of expected utility theory. Between mid-April and early May 1950, Samuelson composed three papers in which he attacked von Neumann and Morgenstern's axiomatic system. By 1952, however, Samuelson had somewhat unexpectedly become a resolute supporter of the expected utility hypothesis. Why did Samuelson change his mind? Based on the correspondence between Samuelson, Savage, Marschak, and Friedman, this article reconstructs the joint intellectual journey that led Samuelson to accept expected utility theory and Savage to revise his motivations for supporting it.","[Moscati, Ivan] Univ Insubria, Econ, Varese, Italy; [Moscati, Ivan] Bocconi Univ, Hist Econ, Milan, Italy",University of Insubria; Bocconi University,"Moscati, I (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Econ, Varese, Italy.;Moscati, I (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Hist Econ, Milan, Italy.",ivan.moscati@uninsubria.it,"MOSCATI, IVAN/AAJ-8134-2021","MOSCATI, IVAN/0000-0002-8995-0015",Fondazione Cariplo; European Society for the History of Economic Thought,Fondazione Cariplo(Fondazione Cariplo); European Society for the History of Economic Thought,"I would like to acknowledge the following for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper: Roger Backhouse, Simon Cook, Marco Dardi, Martin Dufwenberg, Itzhak Gilboa, Nicola Giocoli, Catherine Herfeld, Jean-Sebastien Lenfant, Michael Mandler, Massimo Marinacci, Steve Medema, Philippe Mongin, Aldo Montesano, David Teira, Peter Wakker, and Carlo Zappia.

We undertake an interpretative review of the various uses of the concept in international economics. It is argued (a la Erik Reinert) that the concept of competitiveness is coherent in the presence of dynamic externalities, with a 'winner picking' exercise, by social planners, at its core. However, its usefulness for real-world policymaking can be limited because of practical problems (political and information imperfections) of picking the 'real winners'. These problems are nonetheless not insurmountable. There is ample evidence that competitiveness strategies can work if they are the 'right' kind for a given political configuration.

COOPER; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MALMQUIST INDEX; TIME HORIZON; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT,"This study discusses a new use of DEA environmental assessment to measure a possible occurrence of desirable congestion, or eco-technology innovation, in electric power plants. The phenomenon is compared with an occurrence of undesirable congestion in this study. The identification of undesirable congestion is important to avoid a cost increase and a shortage of generation. However, the identification of desirable congestion is much more important than that of undesirable congestion from the perspective of environmental assessment. This study looks for a sustainable economic growth by identifying eco-technology innovation that can be effectively used to reduce the amount of air pollution so that electric power companies satisfy a governmental standard on environmental protection. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the performance of coal-fired power plants in the United States. This study finds two policy implications. First, power plants operated by bituminous coal (i.e., black coal) outperform those with sub-bituminous coal (i.e., brawn coal). The result implies that power plants with sub-bituminous coal should be replaced by bituminous coal. Second, the undesirable congestion, due to a line limit between points of power generation and consumption, may occur on most of coal-fired power plants. In contrast, desirable congestion, due to eco-technology innovation, may occur on a limited number of power plants. Thus, the identification of desirable congestion assists us in selecting which technology, or the type of power plant, should be invested to facilitate eco-technology innovation and its related engineering management for a future sustainable economic growth.

Global development assistance for health (DAH) increased substantially in the MDGs era, from US $10.8 billion in 2001 to $28.1 billion by 2012 (in 2010 US dollars), and it played a crucial role in tackling global challenges such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. In this paper, we describe the likely health challenges of the SDGs era and the types of international assistance that will be required to help tackle these challenges. We propose a new way of classifying DAH based on considering the functions that it will need to serve in order to address these post-2015 challenges. We apply this new classification to the current health aid spending of one donor, Sweden, as a case study.

In the interest of identifying other key factors that influence state-level employment growth rates, the effective income tax rate in each state, quality of life elements and labour market considerations are also included in the analysis. The study period runs from the year 2000 to the year 2007, ending just prior to the Great Recession'. The estimation results imply that the state-level employment growth rate in the US was an increasing function of the percentage net growth rate in the number of small firms in each state.

We find interprovincial trade is an important contributor to Canada's GDP and welfare, though there are significant costs to such trade. Reducing interprovincial trade costs by 10% yields aggregate gains of 0.9%; eliminating our preferred estimates of costs, gains average between 3% and 7%equivalent to real GDP gains between $50 billion and $130 billion.

We study this question with a natural experiment from the German federal state of Hesse. The experiment is an electoral reform for local elections that improved the electoral prospects of smaller parties and party rebels. However, local politicians from the large mainstream parties could adjust municipal political institutions in such a way as to counteract this effect of the reform. One such institutional adjustment was to reduce the size of the local council because a reduction in council size raises the implicit electoral threshold and thus disadvantages especially smaller parties. Using adataset that covers all 426 Hessian municipalities over the period 1989-2011, we document with a difference-in-discontinuities design that municipalities where the electoral competitiveness of smaller parties improved more after the reform saw a larger reduction in their council size. Hence, established parties appear to erect barriers to entry by adjusting political institutions once new political actors become viable electoral alternatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is thus a call for a greater involvement of private providers to supply affordable and high-quality services to the population. In particular, it is often suggested that not-for-profit institutions should play a larger role, given their social mission. But do not-for-profits really behave differently from for-profit institutions? The literature does not provide a clear answer to this question. The present contribution offers evidence based on a simple theoretical model and price data from health care providers in Uganda with different governance structures. Using differences in market structure as source of variation, we find that not-for-profits indeed behave differently from for-profit institutions, with a pricing behavior that is consistent with an emphasis on health impact and not just profit maximization.

A structural change is understood as a statistically significant change in model parameter(s). Prior to the first quarter of 1999, there was a structural change that can be primarily attributed to shocks impacting only the domestic economy, and to the domestic monetary authority's increased preferences towards inflation and exchange rate growth. The elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported consumption goods also increased sharply in this period. As far as the recent economic recession is concerned, it was caused by a much more persistent worldwide technology shock. Habit formation dropped abruptly during the crisis as households tended not to smooth their consumption much anymore. Recursive impulse response analysis carried out on the model suggests that the propagation mechanisms in the model economy changed, implying that the identified structural changes were accompanied by a change in behaviour of the model economy.","[Capek, Jan] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Capek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",capek@econ.muni.cz,"Čapek, Jan/H-3581-2013","Čapek, Jan/0000-0001-7640-5272","Projects of Large Infrastructure for Research, Development, and Innovations [LM2010005]","Projects of Large Infrastructure for Research, Development, and Innovations","The access to computing and storage facilities owned by parties and projects contributing to the National Grid Infrastructure MetaCentrum, provided under the programme Projects of Large Infrastructure for Research, Development, and Innovations No. LM2010005 is highly appreciated.",,26,2,2,0,5,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The frequency distribution of effort-elicitation strategies across firms is governed by a replicator dynamic that generates wage differential as a long-run equilibrium. Although firms willing to elicit more effort have to compensate workers with a higher wage rate, a larger proportion of firms adopting such strategy will not necessarily produce a higher wage share and thereby a higher growth rate. The intuition is that, depending on the accompanying rise in labor productivity, the wage share may not vary positively with the proportion of firms paying higher wages.","[da Silveira, Jaylson Jair] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Econ & Int Relat, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Lima, Gilberto Tadeu] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade de Sao Paulo,"da Silveira, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Econ & Int Relat, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",jaylson.silveira@ufsc.br; giltadeu@usp.br,"Silveira, Jaylson J.

We show that exporting has competing effects on firm survival. On the one hand, exporting and investing in productivity are complementary activities, while, on the other, exporting activity is an additional source of uncertainty for the firm. We show that both effects influence survival, but operate at different points in time. Specifically, the hazard facing exporters is higher than non-exporters in the initial phase following entry into the export market, reflecting the fact that exporters are particularly vulnerable to shocks in the start-up phase. However, over time, exporters benefit more from productivity gains than non-exporters and the hazard facing exporters falls below that confronting non-exporters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While the theoretical and empirical literature on job search is extensive, most of it involves developed countries. There is less on developing countries and very little on China involving migrant workers in spite of their growing practical and policy importance and the fact that they are constantly engaging in job search. This paper examines the use and impact of job search procedures used by migrant workers in China by taking advantage of a rich data set on migrant workers that has information on their job search procedure as well as a wide array of other personal and human capital characteristics. Our OLS estimates indicate that there is no effect on earnings of using informal versus formal job search procedures for migrant workers in China. However, our IV results suggest that the OLS estimates are subject to severe selection bias from the fact that the choice of job search procedure is endogenous, associated with unobservable factors that affect the choice of informal versus formal procedures and that affect the earnings outcome. Our three different IV estimates designed to deal with this bias indicate that informal procedures (various aspects of family and friends) are associated with earnings that are 33 to 43% below the uses of more formal procedures. The decomposition results indicate that the most important variable contributing to pay advantage of those who use formal as opposed to informal procedures is education. In sum, our results suggest that policies to encourage or facilitate migrant workers using more formal job search procedures and reducing barriers that compel them to rely on informal procedures can yield better job matches with higher earnings.

When we focus on those countries within a middle range of institutional development, and thus within the middle range of income per capita, for these countries, the experience of integration is tempered significantly by increasing tradability of output.

Core EMU countries took on extra foreign leverage to expose themselves to the peripherals. We present a stylized model that illustrates possible mechanisms for these developments. We then analyze the geography of international debt flows using multiple data sources and provide evidence that after the euro's introduction, core EMU countries increased their borrowing from outside of the EMU and their lending to the EMU periphery.

This paper develops an economic growth model with endogenous economic institutions, which provides an alternative theoretical explanation for the persistent income differences between the United States and the other high income countries. It argues that because innovation is more skill intensive than imitation, skilled individuals in the US (the leader country) have more human capital than skilled individuals in the other high income countries (the followers). This implies greater willingness and ability by skilled individuals in the US to actively participate in politics. As a result, US voters choose better for growth policies than the voters in the other high income countries, and this prevents the other high income countries from catching up to the United States. The model developed in this paper predicts that follower countries cannot fully catch up to the leader if they have the same or slightly better exogenous characteristics. They can only fully catch up if their exogenous characteristics are significantly better than those of the leader country. This result emphasizes the importance of historically given initial conditions.","[Pargianas, Christos] Univ Scranton, Dept Econ & Finance, Scranton, PA 18510 USA",University of Scranton,"Pargianas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Scranton, Dept Econ & Finance, 320 Madison Ave, Scranton, PA 18510 USA.",christos.pargianas@scranton.edu,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980s/1990s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve debt write-offs. Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings.

A stylized model with two key features is developed: (1) apprentices are more productive due to industry-specific training, but (2) from the firm's perspective, when training apprentices, technological innovation is costly since training becomes obsolete. Thus, apprentices correlate with slower adoption of skill-replacing technologies, but also less employment polarization. We test this hypothesis on German regions given local variation in apprenticeship systems until 1976. The results show little computer adoption and no employment polarization related to apprentices, but similar displacement of non-apprentices by computers as in the US. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on the tariff reduction schedules mandated by the agreement, it shows that industries represented by strong lobby groups were faced with more favorable tariff reduction paths in both countries: phase-out periods were longer at home and shorter in the partner country. This result provides evidence on the involvement of industry lobbying in negotiation of regional trade agreements and suggests that countries negotiating trade agreements are responsive to the interests of lobbying groups from across the border.

Average real wages are found to be acyclical, but this reflects, in large part, the effect of changes in the composition of the labour force related to unemployment variations over the cycle. Using longitudinal micro data from the ECHP and SILC panels to control for composition effects, we estimate the elasticities of real wage growth to unemployment increases between -0.6 and -1 over the period 1994-2011. Composition effects have been particularly large since 2008, and they explain most of the stagnation or increase in the average wage observed in some countries from 2008 to 2011. In contrast, at a constant labour force composition in terms of education and experience, the figures indicate a significant decrease in average wages during the downturn, particularly in countries most affected by the crisis. Overall, there is no evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity during the Great Recession in most countries in our sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the process of globalization, the importance of human resource management and its parts is increasing. A new approach to human resource management is associated with the entrance to the knowledge economy. Corporate culture is an integral part of human resource management. However it can be often perceived as unimportant by managers. The corporate culture (together with an atmosphere, which it creates) can have a positive or a negative impact on all activities in the enterprise. Corporate culture and its management in today's society is becoming a world trend, which helps to maintain the competitiveness not only in the local market, but in the international environment. The paper investigates the existence of a relationship between corporate culture and financial performance The paper deals with corporate culture, which is expressed through G. Hofstede's cultural dimensions and explores the existence of its influence on financial performance of the surveyed companies. The aim of the paper is an analysis of relationships between cultural dimensions and selected indicators through statistical methods. Power distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Masculinity vs. Femininity, Uncertainty avoidance and Short-term vs. Longterm orientation belong to the cultural dimensions of corporate culture and these cultural dimensions can be used for diagnostics of corporate culture. Selected indicators are: profitability ratios, Asset Turnover Ratio, etc. It can be concluded that desirable cultural dimensions of corporate culture may help enterprises to increase and maintain competitiveness.","[Adamova, Marketa; Krninska, Ruzena] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Adamova, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",adamom01@ef.jcu.cz; krninska@ef.jcu.cz,,,"Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia [039/2013/S, 053/2016/S]",Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia,This paper is an output of the science projects the Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia: Human Resource management of small and medium-sized enterprises [039/2013/S] and Innovation management and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises [053/2016/S].,,24,2,2,2,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,7,14,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800002,0

We also examine the role of socioeconomic diversity on tax compliance, testing whether within-county heterogeneity in household income, language, race, and religion can help explain variation in non-filing rates. We find that non-filing is increasing with heterogeneity by race, although not by income or language, and that non-filing is decreasing with heterogeneity by religious membership.

Employees can either be hired by the manager, explicitly not hired by him and nevertheless assigned to him or exogenously assigned to him. We present data from three different treatments. For all three treatments we find escalation bias by managers. Managers exhibit a positive bias towards those employees they have hired or a negative one towards those they have explicitly not hired.

A large and increasing literature has focused on the levers underlying EIs that are external to the firm, such as stakeholder and policy pressures. Little attention, however, has been devoted to the possible role of local spillovers of a sector/geographical nature as a factor that correlates with EIs and economic performances. A rich data set that covers the innovative activities and economic performances of firms in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, an area dense in manufacturing districts, is analysed. EIs' drivers and effects on firms' performance are investigated through a two-step procedure. First, we examine the relevance of spatial levers, namely, whether high rates of eco-innovators in a given local area induce the adoption of EIs in firms located in the same local area. The role of the 'agglomeration lever' turns out to be fairly local in nature: we find that spillovers are significantly inducing innovation within municipal boundaries. Second, we test whether EIs adoptions have significantly increased firms' economic performances and find that some firms' productivity performances are positively related to EI adoption.","[Antonioli, Davide; Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Ferrara, Italy; [Borghesi, Simone] Univ Siena, Dept Polit & Int Sci, Siena, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Siena,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Ferrara, Italy.",massimiliano.mazzanti@unife.it,"Borghesi, Simone/ABG-2353-2020","mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942; BORGHESI, SIMONE/0000-0002-7419-1212","MIUR (Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research) [2010S2LHSE]","MIUR (Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support by MIUR (Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research) for the PRIN 2010-2011 National Research Project (prot. 2010S2LHSE).",,96,66,66,3,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

This is particularly true among regional jurisdictions within a federal country with decentralized power. The regional allocation of emissions permits could hinder the political feasibility of national GHG mitigation policies. We build a multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to assess the implications of different burden sharing rules in a hypothetical national GHG abatement policy with a market-based instrument. In addition to assessing the impacts of regional permit allocation rules that entail inter-regional transfers of wealth, we consider a particular emissions allocation scheme, called 'no prior entitlement' (NPE), that avoids such transfers.

The aim of the paper, which has the form of a case study, is to evaluate the implementation processes and fulfillment of adopted development strategies in Trnava self-governing region, as well as to assess their relevance and estimate their expected impacts and sustainability. Qualitative assessment of the strategy implementation was based on the study of documents, interviews with key respondents and expert judgment. The evaluation was based on available documents from Trnava self-governing region. In the strategy implementation we consider, as the biggest barrier, the lack of links between the strategic documents and the program budgets, which are too general and do not allow identification of specific activities within the strategy.","[Balazova, Eva; Valach, Maros] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Publ Adm, Fac European Studies & Reg, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Balázová, E (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Publ Adm, Fac European Studies & Reg, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",eva.balazova@uniag.sk; maros.valach@uniag.sk,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,176,184,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-21,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500022,0

Personalization is considered as one of the most effective means for service companies to develop long-term relationships with their customers. However, it still remains unclear how personalization should be expressed while developing long-term relationships with service customers. Thus, the aim of this study is to reason theoretically the effect of personalization on long-term relationships with service customers and to test it empirically on the example of high personal contact services. Theoretical studies reveal that personalized interaction between a service customer and a company is a three-dimensional construct, dimensions of which are personalized contact, personalized physical environment, and customer environment. Results of personalization in the context of the long-term relationships development are expressed through relationship quality (trust, satisfaction, and commitment) and customer loyalty (loyalty to a service company and loyalty to a certain employee). Hair salon services were chosen as a case for the empirical research. Results of the empirical research show that dimensions of personalized interaction influence both relationship quality dimensions and relationship results. The most significant dimension of personalized interaction while developing long-term relationships with customers of hair salons is personalized contact. The paper gives some practical insights for the development of long-term relationships with customers of hair salons.","[Banyte, Jurate; Gadeikiene, Agne; Rutelione, Ausra; Kakneviciene, Inga] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banyte, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.banyte@ktu.lt; agne.gadeikiene@ktu.lt; ausra.rutelione@ktu.lt; inga.kakneviciene@gmail.com,"Gadeikienė, Agnė/AAV-1568-2020","Gadeikienė, Agnė/0000-0001-7719-4980; Banyte, Jurate/0000-0002-9994-9712",,,,,45,1,3,1,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The results of the conducted analyses indicate an increase in developmental divergence, i.e. regional disparities, and extremely unfavourable population trends are identified as the key factor of negative economic developments. Aiming to create a successful development model, starting from the existing comparative advantages and specificities of Eastern Croatia, the authors analysed possible effects of implementation of the so-called, green economy as an appropriate model of economic development based on the principles of sustainable development. Starting from the theoretical and methodological framework of green economy, the paper analyses necessary preconditions for its implementation in Eastern Croatia, and provides arguments for transformation of the current economic structure of the region towards strategic selection and implementation of development policies in line with the principles of green economy.","[Bogovic, Nada Denona; Drezgic, Sasa; Cegar, Sasa] Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Bogovic, ND (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nada@efri.hr; sdrezgic@efri.hr; scegar@efri.hr,"Drezgić, Saša/S-4114-2018; Drezgic, Sasa/GVR-7966-2022; Čegar, Saša/S-7674-2018; BOGOVIĆ, NADA DENONA/R-5242-2018",,,,,,17,2,2,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,646,654,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600065,0
