PPT has been adopted by multilateral institutions, official development agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). PPT assumes an absolute definition of poverty that is based on net income. This definition allows the consideration of a tourism initiative as pro-poor' even though the income earned by the poor population may be marginal. This paper analyses whether PPT's concept of poverty adequately addresses the issues in rural poverty. We analyse one case of unequal distribution of income generated from tourism in the 1990s (Amantani Island, Peru). The paper concludes that PPT's concept of poverty circumvents the fact that an unequal distribution of income could imply a loss in the quality of life for the majority of a rural population: the high-income social sector tends to increase its economic and political power to the detriment of other social sectors.","Inst Altos Estudios Nacl, Quito 271, Ecuador",,"Gascón, J (通讯作者)，Inst Altos Estudios Nacl, Rio Amazonas N37, Quito 271, Ecuador.",jordi.gascon@iaen.edu.ec,,"Gascon, Jordi/0000-0002-0947-614X","Proyecto Prometeo (Prometeo Project) of the Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion - SENESCYT of the Republic of Ecuador","Proyecto Prometeo (Prometeo Project) of the Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion - SENESCYT of the Republic of Ecuador","This paper was made possible through the support of the Proyecto Prometeo (Prometeo Project) of the Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion - SENESCYT of the Republic of Ecuador.

However, a separate literature highlights the empirical importance of information for voter participation, and existing explanations for this are that uninformed citizens either expect smaller benefits from voting, or defer strategically to peers who know more. This paper simply points out that, while either of these theories offers a plausible explanation for the importance of information, neither is robust if the motivation for voting is unrelated to the election outcome. This is because citizens with positive net voting costs should abstain, no matter how well informed, while those with negative net voting costs should vote, no matter how poorly informed. Thus, the purported resolution to the turnout paradox raises a new paradox of information and voter turnout. Intuitively, the quality of a vote should matter only if the vote is somehow instrumental, suggesting that future work should continue to explore instrumental rationales for voting.","[McMurray, Joseph] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"McMurray, J (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",joseph.mcmurray@byu.edu,,,,,,,46,8,10,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2015,165.0,1-2,,,,,13,23,,10.1007/s11127-015-0288-1,0.0,,,11,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CX0ZR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365426500002,0

In particular, the role of credit rating agencies as an intermediary between investors and bond issuers is discussed. We model this setting in a dynamic framework in which both rating agencies and bond issuers are of heterogeneous quality. Rating agencies can apply costly research technology to reveal the fundamental nature of bond issuers and engage in rating smoothing. We show that rating smoothing can compensate for low research quality, even though it is accompanied by a quality deterioration in the rating market and market clustering. Moreover, low-quality bond issuers have a general tendency to match with low-quality rating agencies. If investors place a strong emphasis on the reputation of rating agencies, rating markets also tend to be strongly clustered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This policy inspired similar efforts across the country and represents a potentially important direction for child care policy. To date, the implications of labor unions for the cost, type, and availability of subsidized child care have not been evaluated empirically. In this study, we examine the impact of granting Illinois HBCPs the right to form a labor union on (a) the type of child care (licensed vs. license-exempt/home-based vs. center-based) used by subsidy-receiving Illinois infants and toddlers; (b) the per-child cost of subsidized child care for infants and toddlers; and (c) the percentage of Illinois infants and toddlers who use child care subsidies. To conduct these analyses, we combine data from the Current Population Survey with Child Care and Development Fund administrative records on U.S. infants and toddlers whose families received child care subsidies during the period from 2002 to 2008. We use both a traditional difference-in-differences as well as a comparative case study with a synthetic control group approach. The synthetic control group approach improves on traditional comparative case studies by providing a transparent, empirical approach for constructing the counterfactual, documenting comparison units' contribution to the synthetically created control group and detailing the degree to which the synthetic control group is, or is not, similar to the treated unit on preintervention measures of the outcome as well as on other selected characteristics. We find that subsidy-receiving Illinois infants and toddlers spent an average of between 6.4 and 7 percentage points more hours in licensed care settings, as compared to license-exempt settings, in the three years following child care unionization. We also find that between 0.7 and 1.1 percentage points fewer Illinois infants and toddlers used child care subsidies following unionization.

This paper adds to the literature by assessing the level of business cycle synchronization among 10 major East Asian countries, which is considered as a key precondition for a regional currency union. Unlike previous studies, this paper employs a factor-augmented VAR model that encompasses a large set of 62 foreign and domestic variables simultaneously. Five common shocks are identified, and we examine how and to what extent these shocks affect each economy in the region. Empirical results indicate that the majority of East Asian countries respond similarly to world and regional shocks. Of particular importance is the finding that individual GDPs are well synchronized in response to the two major determinants of world and regional GDP shocks. Overall, the evidence presents a positive case for consideration of a regional currency arrangement in East Asia. Some suggestions are offered concerning steps to build a foundation towards greater monetary cooperation in East Asia.

J,"Kang, KH",,,,"Kang, Kyu Ho",,,The predictive density simulation of the yield curve with a zero lower bound,JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Out-of-sample prediction; Predictive accuracy; Bayesian MCMC estimation,TERM STRUCTURE,"Since Diebold and Li (2006) proved the outstanding performance of a three-factor Gaussian dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model in forecasting the U.S. yield curve, the DNS model and its variants have been widely applied in many areas of macroeconomics and finance. However, despite its popularity one practical problem with the DNS approach is that it produces a substantially high probability of negative future short-term government bond yields for the recent financial crises. In this study, we provide predictive densities for yield curves that have, in general, non-negative support. To this end, we propose and estimate a new DNS model that takes a zero lower bound into account. In the model, the yields are determined as a linear function of the vector-autoregressive factors, which is constrained to be non-negative. We employ a Bayesian econometric approach for estimation and density forecasting. As a result of the zero lower bound restriction, the Gibbs-sampling method is no longer applicable, unlike in standard DNS models. Instead, we propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method, and demonstrate that the non-negative predictive yield curve density, as well as the model parameters and factors can be simulated with high efficiency. Moreover, we find that, for the U.S. yield curve, the Svensson four-factor DNS model with a zero lower bound is most preferred among the alternatives we consider. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The paper evaluates the effectiveness for macroeconomic stabilization and the welfare implications of the use of capital account policies in a monetary DSGE model of a small open economy. The model features incomplete markets, imperfect asset substitutability, and nominal rigidities. In this environment, policymakers can respond to fluctuations in capital flows through capital account policies such as sterilized interventions and taxing capital inflows, in addition to conventional monetary policy. The welfare analysis suggests that optimal sterilization and capital controls are complementary policies.","[Liu, Zheng; Spiegel, Mark M.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",,,"Liu, Zheng/0000-0003-2073-0898",,,,,46,36,39,0,22,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Although the literature on political budget cycles is now fairly large, few contributions have explicitly analyzed the determinants of re-election. The use of Bayesian techniques in this context is particularly interesting because, unlike most previous studies, results are not presented as a summary effect such as the average. Rather, our findings show exactly how a given covariate affects the probability of being re-elected. We find that, in general, increases in local government spending positively impact on local governments' chances of re-election. Moreover, the capital expenditure over the whole term positively affects the re-election probability, although the pre-electoral capital expenditure has a stronger effect on the chances of re-election. We also find that the electorate only rewards increases in current expenditures made in the pre-election period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that shareholder voting is an effective mechanism for exercising governance around the world.","[Iliev, Peter] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lins, Karl V.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Miller, Darius P.] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Roth, Lukas] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Southern Methodist University; University of Alberta,"Lins, KV (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, 1655 E Campus Ctr Dr,Rm 8209, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",karl.lins@business.utah.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Miller, Darius P/A-9306-2009","Roth, Lukas/0000-0002-2992-7753",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; GRA Rice Faculty Fellowship; Killam Research Fund,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); GRA Rice Faculty Fellowship; Killam Research Fund,"We wish to thank the editor (David Denis) and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

It exploits the difference in the period after 2010 when India did not accumulate reserves but faced higher capital flow pressures, relative to a previous managed-float period marked by significant absorption of surplus capital flows. Along with other determinants, the sensitivity of rupee volatility is examined. The paper finds that adequate reserve holdings significantly reduce exchange rate volatility irrespective of the exchange rate regime; the effect is more through influence upon market sentiment and confidence than actual intervention. It contributes to existing evidence on the role of reserves in mitigating exchange rate volatility amid capital flow swings and offers insights into the policy environment depicted in the trilemma.","Natl Council Appl Econ Res, Parisila Bhawan, New Delhi 110002, India",,"Kohli, R (通讯作者)，Natl Council Appl Econ Res, Parisila Bhawan, 11 Indraprastha Estate, New Delhi 110002, India.",renukohli@yahoo.com,,,"Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Bilateral Programme Fund","Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Bilateral Programme Fund","The author wishes to thank an anonymous referee for very helpful suggestions and participants of the conference on Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy and Financial Stability in Emerging Markets and Developing Countries held at the University of Leipzig, October 2014, for comments.

Using panel data from rural Vietnam and rainfall data in an instrumental variable approach, the results suggest that populations face an increased risk of illness in the year they are exposed to drought. Households with reduced agricultural incomes and limited access to coping mechanisms seem particularly affected. Drought-related health shocks also cause financial burden for many households, with health expenditures increasing by 9-17% of total consumption.

We study the relation between capital ratio and cost efficiency for Chinese banks over the period 2004-2009, taking advantage of the profound regulatory changes in capital requirements that occurred during this period to measure the exogenous impact of an increase in the capital ratio on banks' cost efficiency. We find that such an increase has a positive effect on cost efficiency, the size of which depends to an extent on the bank's ownership type. Our results therefore suggest that capital requirements can improve cost efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Allocating the national target among China's provinces is complicated by the fact that more than half of China's national carbon emissions are embodied in interprovincial trade, with the relatively developed eastern provinces relying on the center and west for energy-intensive imports. This study develops a consistent methodology to adjust regional emissions-intensity targets for trade-related emissions transfers and assesses its economic effects on China's provinces using a regional computable-general-equilibrium (CGE) model of the Chinese economy. This study finds that in 2007 China's eastern provinces outsource 14 % of their territorial emissions to the central and western provinces. Adjusting the provincial targets for those emissions transfers increases the reduction burden for the eastern provinces by 60 %, while alleviating the burden for the central and western provinces by 50 % each. The CGE analysis indicates that this adjustment could double China's national welfare loss compared to the homogenous and politics-based distribution of reduction targets. A shared-responsibility approach that balances production-based and consumption-based emissions responsibilities is found to alleviate those unbalancing effects and lead to a more equal distribution of economic burden among China's provinces.","[Springmann, Marco] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Zhang, Da; Karplus, Valerie J.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Da] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tsinghua University,"Springmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford Martin Programme Future Food, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",marco.springmann@dph.ox.ac.uk,,"Zhang, Da/0000-0002-0790-9298; Karplus, Valerie/0000-0001-5493-9150; Springmann, Marco/0000-0001-6028-5712",Eni S.p.A.; ICF International; Shell International Limited; French Development Agency (AFD); AXA Research Fund; Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Development and Reform Commission; Rio Tinto; MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,"Eni S.p.A.; ICF International; Shell International Limited; French Development Agency (AFD); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Development and Reform Commission; Rio Tinto; MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change","The authors thank Eni S.p.A., ICF International, Shell International Limited, and the French Development Agency (AFD), founding sponsors of the China Energy and Climate Project.

We test for the null hypothesis of a unit root of the current account-GDP ratio against the alternative hypothesis that encompasses smooth break, size nonlinearity and sign asymmetry at the same time. For this purpose, we propose a battery of new test statistics and provide their critical values via Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that the breaks alone can account for rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root, although the evidence in support of the current-account sustainability is not sufficiently strong (only for Australia, the Czech Republic and New Zealand). Moreover, the evidence in favor of the current-account sustainability has been increased (i.e., Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Portugal) after taking account of size nonlinearity and structural break at the same time. Finally, for Finland, New Zealand and Ireland, the speed of mean reversion of the current account-GDP ratios is dependent not only upon the absolute deviation from the equilibrium, but also upon the sign of the shock.

We explore experimentally how threshold uncertainty affects collective action in a series of threshold public goods games. Whereas the public good is always provided when the exact value of the threshold is known, threshold uncertainty is generally detrimental for the public good provision as contributions become more erratic. The negative effect of threshold uncertainty is particularly severe when it takes the form of ambiguity, i.e. when players are not only unaware of the value of the threshold, but also of its probability distribution.

Factors that may influence such decisions, including individuals' socio-demographics and the built environment of their residential place, have been examined in previous studies. However, characteristics of personal social networks and the social environment of residential neighborhoods have not received much attention. We argue that these social context factors may determine the tradeoffs between choosing a residential neighborhood or other places for daily activities, especially discretionary activities. Using data from an activity-travel diary survey conducted in Beijing in 2013, we examine and model the importance of personal social networks and residential neighborhood social environment variables in the choice of location and time allocation for discretionary activities. Our findings suggest that the size, nature and spatial ordering of personal social networks significantly influence individuals' tradeoffs between activities and time use in and out-of residential neighborhoods. This study will contribute to the growing literature on social network and activity-travel behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that return predictability associated with accruals attributable to accounting distortions is largely attenuated and not statistically significant at conventional levels, after the introduction of FRS3. In contrary, the predictive ability of accruals attributable to growth for future returns is not substantially affected and remains strong in magnitude from the pre-FRS3 to the post-FRS3 periods. As a consequence, total accruals continue to predict returns following FRS3.

It challenges conventional result that tighter environmental tax has either no long term effect at all, or has a positive long term effect. In the case of Cobb-Douglas production functions and logarithmic utilities, this paper demonstrates that the technology used in the abatement sector determines the existence and direction of the growth effect. In the case of output taxation, if the abatement sector is relatively more (respectively less) intensive in human capital than the final output sector, tighter environmental tax increases (resp. reduces) growth in the long term. This result always holds true for finite life expectancy but for infinite life expectancy it only holds true when the labour supply is endogenous. The transitional impact of tighter environmental policy is also investigated. We find that the magnitude of the short term effects of environmental taxation varies according to the technology used in the abatement and final output sectors, and that there is a reverse trade-off between the short and the long term effects.","Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Lab Econ & Management Nantes LEMNA, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Pautrel, X (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Lab Econ & Management Nantes LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",xavier.pautrel@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,30,4,4,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The same analysis is conducted excluding at first and then including international trade tax revenues in (total) indirect tax revenues, as a way to disentangle any impact of trade liberalization. In both cases, the results suggest that the size of the shadow economy increases the ratio of indirect tax revenues to GDP, as long as informality does not exceed a cutoff value. When the size of the shadow economy exceeds that level, any further increase affects indirect taxation negatively. The findings are robust to a number of sensitivity tests and when addressing the problem of potential endogeneity. The empirical evidence is in line with the predictions provided by the theoretical framework of the paper.","[Vlachaki, Mina] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Vlachaki, M (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Ctr & Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",a.vlachaki@uvt.nl,,,,,,,34,6,7,1,16,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In other circumstances a mortgage holder may default due to personal income decline which makes payment infeasible (unaffordability default) or for a combination of strategic and affordability causes (dual-trigger default). This paper utilizes a database of troubled Irish mortgages to model the default decisions of Irish mortgage holders. We include both affordability-related and strategic-related explanatory variables. We find that both types of explanatory variables play a role in the explosive growth in Irish mortgage default after the Irish banking crisis and temporary legal prohibition of property repossession. We find that a dual-trigger model of default best fits the Irish data. Given the unusual features of the Irish market, our findings both complement and strengthen existing empirical findings from other national mortgage markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here we reveal the brain mechanisms underlying music-induced unstable risk preferences using functional MRI (fMRI). Subjects listened to self-selected liked or disliked music while they decided to accept or reject risky gambles. Behaviorally loss aversion was lower during liked music than during disliked or no music. At the neural level, reduced loss aversion was associated with a specific pattern of value coding in amygdala and dorsal striatum: during disliked music gambles with high expected reward induced higher activation than gambles with low expected reward, whereas during liked music this activation pattern was reversed. Furthermore, individual differences in loss aversion influenced value coding in such a way that for the most loss-averse subjects, bilateral activation of anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex increased as the expected value of the gamble increased, whereas for the least loss-averse subjects increase in potential reward was associated with decreasing activation in those areas. We propose music-modulated value coding in amygdala and striatum as a neural mechanism supporting emotion-dependent adjustments to risk-taking which in turn facilitate behavior depending on how dangerous versus safe the environment is experienced to be.","[Halko, Marja-Liisa] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Halko, Marja-Liisa] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Ctr Econ Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Halko, Marja-Liisa; Makela, Tuomas] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Espoo, Finland; [Halko, Marja-Liisa] Aalto Univ, Adv Magnet Imaging Ctr, Aalto NeuroImaging, Sch Sci, Espoo, Finland; [Nummenmaa, Lauri] Aalto Univ, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Sch Sci, Espoo, Finland; [Nummenmaa, Lauri] Univ Turku, Turku PET Ctr, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Nummenmaa, Lauri] Univ Turku, Dept Psychol, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; [Hlushchuk, Yevhen; Schurmann, Martin] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Brain Res Unit, Espoo, Finland; [Schurmann, Martin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Aalto University; Aalto University; Aalto University; University of Turku; University of Turku; Aalto University; University of Nottingham,"Halko, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",marja-liisa.halko@helsinki.fi,"Nummenmaa, Lauri/ACX-4295-2022; Schurmann, Martin/A-2747-2012","Nummenmaa, Lauri/0000-0002-2497-9757; Schurmann, Martin/0000-0002-0848-0251; Hlushchuk, Yevhen/0000-0001-6869-6305; Halko, Marja-Liisa/0000-0001-6295-8917","research project aivoAALTO (Aalto University); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Research Foundation of Cooperative Banks, Finland; Academy of Finland (MIND program) [265917]; European Research Council [313000]","research project aivoAALTO (Aalto University); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Research Foundation of Cooperative Banks, Finland; Academy of Finland (MIND program); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC))","This study was performed at Aalto University.

The overall benefits of the Baltic Sea Action Plan, the present convention on nutrient abatement, clearly outweigh the costs. Nevertheless, the total cost could be almost halved if the mix of measures and the regional targets were planned in a spatially cost-effective manner and if the consequent reductions of nitrogen and phosphorus, the two nutrients causing eutrophication, were better balanced. Policy optimizations, however, suggest that the optimal level of nutrient abatement is somewhat lower than the more ambitious level envisaged by the convention.

The boom generated high incomes and investment in global resources, especially coal. It boosted Indonesian growth and diverted the policy focus from the productivity-raising reforms that are necessary for broad-based growth. Arbitrary interventions reduced the gains from the boom, especially in commodities other than coal, but also diminished the size of the boom and therefore the economic adjustment challenge that faces Indonesia now. Indonesia handled the Dutch disease and related challenges better than some countries and worse than others. Australia and Indonesia are now the world's largest coal exporters, so this comparison receives attention here. The end of the boom can create opportunities for a return to broad-based development, so long as policy settings are favourable to productivity growth and improved economy-wide competitiveness. The fuel-subsidy reforms are a good start.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Garnaut, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,38,26,30,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

For this purpose, the article applies a non-parametric approach, i.e. data envelopment analysis (DEA), to assess the best performers in terms of transforming existing bureaucratic burdens into selected SME indicators, such as growth in their numbers, employment or value added in the 2010-2014 period. The empirical results show that Luxembourg, Sweden and, in particular, the Baltic States can serve as a good benchmark for transforming a relatively favourable environment of public administration excellence into SME indicator growth. On the other hand, Denmark and the UK, despite their top ease-of-doing-business rankings could not significantly spur SME growth in the considered period. Nevertheless, the main goal for the large majority of EU member states, especially in South-east Europe and the Mediterranean region, remains a further reduction of bureaucracy that could be useful for improving the regulatory environment of SMEs and thus aid in an even more rapid recovery from the crisis.","[Aristovnik, Aleksander] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Obadic, Alka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Zagreb,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010; Obadić, Alka/H-9836-2018","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649; Obadić, Alka/0000-0002-8915-8853",,,,,26,29,29,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,761,774,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900017,0

Specifically, we investigate whether students attending small high schools have better graduation/enrollment rates and achievement than similar students who attend regular CPS high schools. We show that students who choose to attend a small school are more disadvantaged on average, including having prior test scores that are about 0.2 standard deviations lower than their elementary school classmates. To address the selection problem, we use an instrumental variables strategy and compare students who live in the same neighborhoods but differ in their residential proximity to a small school. In this approach, one student is more likely to sign up for a small school than another statistically identical student because the small school is located closer to the student's house and therefore the cost of attending the school is lower. The distance-to-small-school variable has strong predictive power to identify who attends a small school. We find that small schools students are substantially more likely to persist in school and eventually graduate. Nonetheless, there is no positive impact on student achievement as measured by test scores. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Further, the influence of news arrival, and liquidity (volatility) shocks on the deviations persists for several hours. Finally, we document significant decline (by at least 80%) in the deviations between 1998 and 2010.

Firms began initiating the plans in 2006. We investigate the impact of these plans on firm performance by comparing option-award firms with similar non-award matching firms. The change in ROE for the option-award firms is significantly higher than the matching firms. This is primarily due to their performance holding up better during the global financial crisis while the matching firms' performance deteriorates. The stock price of these firms shows a positive reaction to the announcement, but no long-term abnormal returns. The better ROE performance for option-award firms is strong for subsets of the sample that are likely to benefit more from incentivized employees; specifically, privately owned firms, firms with higher board independence, and smaller firms. After various robustness tests, we conclude that the higher performance comes from the employee incentives, rather than earnings manipulation, a replacement of cash compensation, a binding of employees to executives, or gaming vesting periods.

Through the ever-growing level of product availability they raise the quality of service, which is positively reflected not only on the growth in sales, but also customer satisfaction. In the opposite case, the out-of-stock problem emerges, affecting not only customers, but also retailers and their suppliers. Bearing in mind, that the causes of the given problem occur most frequently in the last metres of the supply chain, in this paper we investigated the effect of backroom size on product availability, depending on the retail format. For this purpose, we used moderated regression analysis on the sample of 80 fast moving consumer goods in retail stores located on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The obtained results pointed to opposite movements in the smallest and the largest format. Whereas in superettes the out-of-stock level lowers with the increase in the backroom size, it tends to drop in hypermarkets. Therefore, we pointed to some in-store problems that cause product stock-outs in different store formats. In addition to indicating the potential causes of analyzed relations, this paper also presents certain operational and technological solutions related to their mitigation.","[Milicevic, Nikola; Grubor, Aleksandar] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Milicevic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",milicevic.nikola@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Grubor, Aleksandar/AAM-4219-2020; Milicevic, Nikola/JSK-6433-2023","Grubor, Aleksandar/0000-0001-9798-0401; Milicevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4834-6994",,,,,49,7,9,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,661,675,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900011,0

Current work has, however, not sufficiently addressed how the process of institutional change has proceeded on the ground. Given Tanzania's rich and complex colonial - and more recent socialist' - history, it is evident that the process of rural institutional change is not straightforward. This paper focuses on evidence from field research, conducted in 2006-7, from cotton-producing villages in two regions in Tanzania. The paper explores the uneven ways in which the current and new institutional structures are exploited by producers and turns to Tanzania's rural and institutional history to explain these findings.","Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Bargawi, H (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",hb19@soas.ac.uk,,,NCCR Swiss National Foundation Scholarship; University of London; School of Oriental and African Studies,NCCR Swiss National Foundation Scholarship; University of London; School of Oriental and African Studies,"This research was made possible by a NCCR Swiss National Foundation Scholarship.

IPOs and delistings are found to affect the market value of neighboring listed firms: isolated firms decrease in value when they cluster due to local IPOs while clustered firms increase in value as they become more isolated due to local delistings. Local firm clustering and risk tolerance also affect IPO underpricing. Empirical findings depict a framework where IPOs and delistings are locally jointly determined. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a comprehensive firm-level survey, the paper identifies gender wage-productivity differentials by directly estimating the relative productivity levels of workers from the production function of firms. The panel structure of the survey is taken advantage of by following firms that were fully state-owned in the initial year, and distinguishing them from firms that were later privatized. The main results show that privatization was associated with an increase in relative productivity of female workers in high technology industries, and a reduction in relative productivity of female workers in low technology industries. Time varying coefficient results suggest that the improvements in gender outcomes in high technology industries may not be maintained in the long run as the relative wage and productivity ratios tend to deteriorate, potentially due to low supply of highly educated female workers. At the same time, outcomes in privatized low technology industries increase over time, lowering the wage and productivity gaps between male and female workers.","[Dammert, Ana C.] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Ural Marchand, Beyza] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",Carleton University; University of Alberta,"Dammert, AC (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",ana_dammert@carleton.ca; beyza.ural@ualberta.ca,"Marchand, Beyza Ural/L-7610-2015","Marchand, Beyza Ural/0000-0002-7164-591X; Dammert, Ana C./0000-0002-1234-4754",,,,,32,3,3,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

In addition to TGCE, a truncated Black-Scholes model is proposed also. The two truncated models are compared to four prevalent option pricing models, including Black-Scholes (constant variance model), Hull-White (a mean-reverting variance model), GARCH (a time-varying volatility clustering model), and Gram-Charlier expansion (GCE) models. Using ARPE (absolute relative pricing error) as the criterion in Taiwan option market (TXO), the result demonstrates that TGCE model overall performs the best. Besides, truncated Black-Scholes model generally dominates Black-Scholes model, and GCE model generally dominates Black-Scholes, Hull-White and GARCH models. This result consists with the fact that stock return distributions are usually asymmetric and nonmesokurtic as well as essentially not unbounded. This finding implies that an accurate option pricing model should simultaneously consider skewness and kurtosis and truncated interval in the underlying asset return. Additionally, the ARPE against moneyness for all option pricing models forms a negative slope smile curve. Moreover, the pricing performance of TGCE model is so stable to moneyness.

J,"Stearns, ML",,,,"Stearns, Maxwell L.",,,Constitutional law in social choice perspective,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Constitutional law; Judicial review; Stare decisis; Outcome voting; Issue voting; Standing; Narrowest grounds doctrine; Social choice; Dimensionality,,"Constitutional scholars do not typically employ spatial reasoning in their work. And yet, constitutional jurisprudence and much work in judicial politics implicitly rest on assumptions best cast in spatial terms. These include assuming that positions in constitutional disputes, and the views of Supreme Court justices, generally lie along a common liberal-to-conservative ideological dimension. Although the single dimension assumption is often appropriate, it suffers inherent limitations. First, Supreme Court decision-making rules, both within and across cases, expose problems of dimensionality. Second, important substantive doctrines likewise reveal dimensionality. Third, and finally, throughout the Supreme Court's history, positions deemed liberal (or conservative) in one period have emerged as conservative (or liberal) in a later period, suggesting that dimensionality is a persistent feature in our jurisprudential history. Social choice proves uniquely suited to explaining these important aspects of constitutional law. After briefly introducing the discipline of constitutional law and its relationship to social choice, this article offers three illustrations of how social choice analysis deepens our understanding of important substantive areas. The analysis exposes dimensionality within Supreme Court decision-making rules, within separation-of-powers doctrine, and over historical shifts in the liberal and conservative valence of once-prominent jurisprudential positions. Failing to appreciate dimensionality, which lies at the core of social choice theory, when studying the Supreme Court and constitutional law risks a truly one-dimensional understanding of a richer and multidimensional institution and body of doctrine.","Univ Maryland, Francis King Carey Sch Law, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Stearns, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Francis King Carey Sch Law, 500 W Baltimore St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",mstearns@law.umaryland.edu,,"Stearns, Maxwell/0000-0002-8696-0904",,,,,34,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2015,163.0,1-2,,,SI,,167,186,,10.1007/s11127-014-0216-9,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CF6WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352698400012,0

This paper develops a generalized model to highlight features of the theory of the microeconomic rebound effect that are particularly relevant to empirical economists. We demonstrate when common elasticity identities used for empirical estimation are biased and how gross complement and substitute relationships govern this bias.

J,"Evrenk, H; Sher, CY",,,,"Evrenk, Haldun; Sher, Chien-Yuan",,,Social interactions in voting behavior: distinguishing between strategic voting and the bandwagon effect,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Voting behavior; Social interactions; Strategic voting; Bandwagon effects; Multi-party competition,COMPETITION; CANDIDATES; VALENCE,"Prior studies of strategic voting in multi-party elections potentially overestimate the extent of it by counting erroneously votes cast under different motivations as strategic votes. We propose a method that corrects some of this overestimation by distinguishing between strategic voting (voting for a candidate other than the most preferred one to reduce the likelihood of an election victory by a third candidate that is disliked even more) and the votes cast under the 'bandwagon effect' (voting for the expected winner instead of the most preferred party to conform to the majority or to be on the winning side). Our method follows from the observation that a vote cannot be strategic unless the voter believes that it will affect the outcome of the election with a non-zero probability, while a vote cast under the bandwagon effect requires no such belief. Employing survey data that include the respondent's assessment of the importance of his vote, we illustrate this method by estimating the extent of strategic voting in the 2005 UK general election. The estimated extent of strategic voting (4.22 %) is strictly less than self-reported strategic voting (6.94 %), but the discrepancy cannot be attributed in a statistically significant way to the bandwagon effect, suggesting that motivations other than those identified in the literature may be at work.","[Evrenk, Haldun] TOBB Econ & Technol Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey; [Sher, Chien-Yuan] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Sher, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cysher@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Sher, Chien-Yuan/GYQ-7730-2022","Sher, Chien-Yuan/0000-0002-1444-8450; Evrenk, Haldun/0000-0003-4730-1647",,,,,37,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2015,162.0,3-4,,,,,405,423,,10.1007/s11127-015-0241-3,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CD3RE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350997000013,0

Using novel survey data that directly measure foreign exchange scapegoats for 12 exchange rates, we find empirical evidence that supports the scapegoat theory. The resulting models explain a large fraction of the variation and directional changes in exchange rates in sample, although their out-of-sample forecasting performance is mixed.

In this paper, we ask two questions: first, whether Muslim influence has a discernible impact on the content of such constitutions and, second, whether it has an impact on constitutional reality. More precisely, we are interested in the consequences of Islam for institutions securing the rule of law, while taking competing socioeconomic, geographic, and historical explanations explicitly into account. To this end, we construct a new Islamic State Index to measure the influence that Islam has on a society and its political and legal system. We find that Muslim influence is in conflict with the independence of the judiciary and nondiscriminatory legal institutions with respect to gender. Yet, parliamentary power as well as the protection of property rights and religious minorities are not significantly more constrained in Islamic states after we control for alternative explanations. Competing explanations such as the size of oil rents fare rather poorly in explaining differences in important aspects of the rule of law.","[Gutmann, Jerg; Voigt, Stefan] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Voigt, Stefan] CESifo, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Ifo Institut,"Voigt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",jerg.gutmann@uni-hamburg.de; stefan.voigt@uni-hamburg.de,"Gutmann, Jerg/A-2273-2017","Gutmann, Jerg/0000-0003-1215-1116; Voigt, Stefan/0000-0001-5564-3669",,,,,74,33,35,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2015,162.0,3-4,,,,,351,380,,10.1007/s11127-015-0237-z,0.0,,,30,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CD3RE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350997000011,0

Thus prices involve rounding errors. Rounding errors affect the estimation of volatility, and understanding them is critical, particularly when using high frequency data. We study the asymptotic behavior of realized volatility (RV), which is commonly used as an estimator of integrated volatility. We prove the convergence of the RV and scaled RV under varous conditions on the rounding level and the number of observations. A bias-corrected volatility estimator is proposed and an associated central limit theorem is shown. The simulation and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method can yield substantial statistical improvement.","[Li, Yingying] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mykland, Per A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Chicago,"Li, YY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yyli@ust.hk,,,"HKSAR RGC [SBI09/10.BM17, GRF-602710]; National Science Foundation [DMS 06-04758, SES 06-31605, SES 11-24526]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1407812] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1124526] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","HKSAR RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Financial support provided by the HKSAR RGC (grants SBI09/10.BM17 and GRF-602710), and the National Science Foundation (grants DMS 06-04758, SES 06-31605, and SES 11-24526) is gratefully acknowledged.

Findings reveal inadequacies of loss assessment methodologies that result in inaccurate PHL estimates. Moreover, losses are often economic rather than physical product losses. Overall, technologies for loss mitigation fail to address dynamics of supply chains. Consequently, rigorous PHL assessment using systematic methodologies, as well as holistic approaches for losses mitigation are in need. (C) 2014 The Authors.

On average, retail banks suffered less than other financial institutions from unexpected market changes. This paper proposes a new methodology to measure retail banks' business risk, which is defined as the risk of adverse and unexpected changes in banks' profits coming from sudden changes in the banks' activities. This methodology is based on the efficiency frontier methodology, and, more specifically, on the duality property between the directional distance function and the profit function. Using the distance function to compute banks' profitability, we take the distance to the frontier of best practices as a measure of profit inefficiency, i.e. of unexpected losses related to underperformance. In this approach, shifts in the efficiency frontier induced by adverse shocks to banks' volumes serve as a measure of business risk. This measure of profit volatility allows a measurement to be made of the impact of volume changes on banks' profits. This method is applied to a database containing half yearly regulatory accounting reports over the 1993-2011 period for a sample of quite all French banks running a retail banking business model. Our results verify a low level of business risk in retail banking, thus confirming the resiliency of the retail banks' business model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More specific, it focuses on elaborating and empirically testing hypotheses related to structural push and pull factors, e. g. age, gender, education, type of residence, and also to two kinds of psycho-attitudinal factors, i.e. risk aversion and individualist vs. etatist economic ideology. While the literature review gives credit to both hypotheses, especially for the influence of risk attitudes on starting a business, this paper focuses on the analysis of self-employment by using the block-model logistic regression on 2008 Romanian EVS (European Values Survey) data. The results of multivariate analysis confirm the importance of risk aversion for entrepreneurship, as expected, but reject the hypothesis of a significant effect of individual's option for individualist vs. collectivist (or statist) continuum. It is important to notice that, contrary to expectations, two important push factors, i.e. age and education, do not correlate with self-employment and, on the other hand, risk attitude adds itself to the other effects without interacting with it.

Previous research has found that market discipline signals do not significantly improve out-of-sample forecasts relative to accounting-based signals. Most of that evidence, however, comes from periods in the 1990s when the U.S. economy and banking system were healthy, potentially neutralizing an advantage of market signals to incorporate new information quickly. For the period between the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2012, we assess the accuracy of two market signals - expected default frequency (EDF) and subordinated note and debenture (SND) yield spreads - relative to accounting-based signals in forecasting which publicly traded BHCs would become distressed. In 2008, EDF signals were relatively more accurate, but they did not lead to economically significant reductions in missed distress events relative to other signals. Supervisors would have been better off devoting slack resources to monitor BHCs with high commercial real estate concentrations. As the crisis subsided, a failure probability model developed from bank failures in the 1980s and early 1990s was consistently the most accurate signal. For the two dozen BHCs with actively traded SNDs, yield spreads over Treasuries were extremely poor predictors of distress because the spreads were distorted by too-big-to-fail subsidies. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was the most accurate distress signal for these large BHCs. In sum, the evidence to justify systematic reliance on market signals by supervisory agencies to forecast bank distress remains weak. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We construct a formal model to explore private incentives to launch satellites and to mitigate space debris. The model predicts that, relative to the social optimum, firms launch too many satellites and choose technologies which create more debris than is socially optimal.

Various surveys show long term equilibrium between the number of empirical studies that confirm these superior capacities and those failing to do so. In the same time, it is suggested that a possible explanation for these heterogeneity resides in the various methodological approaches when testing technical analysis rules. It seems that the subjective choices of the parameters can bias substantially any empirical results through the negative effects of data mining The paper's objective is to test the sensitivity of the returns generated through the use of the dual moving average crossover rule with respect to the dimension of the investment decision space and the moment in which the investors do the actual trading suggested by the rule. Based on a price of 2,942 observations characterizing the Bucharest Stock Exchange, we ran simulations for 5,670 different trading rules and we found that particular approaches of the trading rule consistently leads to different results, approaches which are more or less prone to boost the rule's profitability. For example, using a two element space of investment decision will always outperform a three element one mainly because of the heavy trading commission fees generated by more frequently changing the investment exposures. We also considered the impact of the trading commissions when evaluating the total returns and that of the net interest that can be earned through borrowing and lending at a differentiated cash rate (namely ROBOR-3M and ROBID-3M).

The key objective for the government is to boost the role of the private sector and enhance its participation as a major player in the economy through explicit support of Small and Medium Enterprises. SME compromises 90% of the total number of companies in the country. With such large domination, the government had designed and implemented strategies in this direction which involve enhancing rules and regulation as well as institutional infrastructure. Also, the government, for the first time, in 2011 has adopted the practice of Islamic banking system in order to address Shariah compliant finance requirement for businesses and projects. This paper is largely based on academic research that will shed light on aspects related to development of SMEs and Islamic banks in Oman. The study is conceptual in nature and analytical method is used based on the secondary documentation related to the government policy / programs regarding to enhancing active participation of SMEs and Islamic Banks towards economic diversification in Oman. It can be concluded that the government is keen to make such cooperation with the private sector succeed because it will bring about future active participation and subsequently diversification of the national economy.

According to Eurostat, in 2013, in Europe, over 8 million young people aged 15-29 were excluded from the labour market and the education system. This boosted the rate of NEET population, aged 15-29, from the 13% level recorded in 2008 to 15.9% in 2013, with significant variations between the Member States: less than 7.5% in the Netherlands, more than 20% in Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Greece and Spain. In Romania, under the impact of the financial crisis, the rate of NEET population increased from 13.2% in 2008 to 19.1% in 2011 and 19.6% in 2013. This paper presents a brief analysis of the labour market in the European Union and the particularities of the youth labour market in Romania. It analyses, for the pre-crisis period and under its impact, the structure, the education and the gender composition of NEET groups.

The credit risk refers to the probability of a company (industrial, commercial or financial) of being unable to cope with the maturity of a loan. With the exception of cases of bad faith - equally rare and hazardous for the borrower-, this situation is related to the difficulties faced by the company. The creditor is exposed to the risk of having a debtor unable, in good faith, of undertaking its commitments due to financial difficulties. The last stage of such difficulties is bankruptcy, which is the result of a longer or shorter process of deterioration of the state of a company. The financial distress is a gradual degradation phenomenon that can be perceived by the external partners of the company. The bankruptcy situation, translated by a special legal situation, is governed by specific laws (Kharoubi and Thomas, 2013). The bankruptcy of a company is an economic topic that concerns and worries all economic agents. The bankruptcy law is balance point which stipulates when and how a company may, or must, be subject to bankruptcy proceedings.","[Barbulescu, Marinela; Hagiu, Alina; Vasilica, Radu] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti,"Barbulescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania.",Marinela.tanascovici@yahoo.com; alinahagiu@yahoo.com; raduvasilica@yahoo.com,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,7,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,591,601,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600059,0

These processes are reflected in the stages of processing and distribution of food and other products of agricultural origin as well as in the pre-production stages. The development of cooperation and division of economic activities in the group of sectors interconnected with agriculture resulted in the formation of commodity/food chains and agribusiness. To succeed in these conditions requires knowledge of the economic context as well as the demand of newly formed agribusiness markets on the global and local scale. It is confirmed that the impact of globalization processes in agribusiness with their positive and negative implications has been significantly gaining grounds also in Europe. So the important aspect here is also how to fulfill the vision of the European model of agriculture and its support associated with the strategy of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and the member states that must react not only to the internal problems of development but also to the changes in the global environment characterized above.,"[Becvarova, Vera; Zdrahal, Ivo] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Becvárová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vera.becvarova@mendelu.cz; ivo.zdrahal@mendelu.cz,"Bečvářová, Věra/E-4321-2018; Zdrahal, Ivo/E-4335-2018","Zdrahal, Ivo/0000-0002-6631-8228; Becvarova, Vera/0000-0003-2015-574X",,,,,4,0,0,0,6,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,61,67,,,,,,7,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300007,0

This paper presents the results of an investigation into how purchasing strategies can vary between companies and countries. Two industrialised building companies, one in Sweden and one in Australia, were the objects of study. The purpose was to compare and understand the rationale behind their purchasing strategies. The interviews and the observations in the factory revealed the differences in the purchasing strategies due to the companies' prerequisites, expectations and cultures. The strategies proved to be different in terms of the split between in-house and outsourced work. Some aspects of the respective strategies did, however, prove to be similar, such as the purchase of prefabricated structural components. It could be useful for researchers and practitioners to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of different supply structures, not least parallel sourcing. In this latter regard, benefits appear to outweigh potential disadvantages that single sourcing confers even where partnerships exist. (C) 2015 The Authors.

With the recent economic recession fiscal policy was regarded with more interest since it was expected to he effective in economic recovery. An approach commonly used to estimate the effects of fiscal policy shocks on economic activity is based on vector autoregressive (VAR) models with different scheme of identification of the shocks. This paper analyzes the effects of a government expenditure shock and tax revenue shock on economic activity by applying a VAR methodology to Romanian data. For identification of fiscal policy shocks I first used a recursive approach (Cholesky decomposition) and second I apply the methodology proposed by Perotti (2002), based on Blanchard and Perotti (1999). The results obtained are consistent with other studies on emergent economies. The impact of fiscal shocks on macroeconomic variable is reduced and the fiscal multipliers are very small.

We show that annuitants could have increased their annuity income by about 5%, by shopping around and purchasing their annuities from alternative providers. Money's worth calculations show that the market is efficient by international standards, with a money's worth above 0.9 for the whole period and close to unity by the end of the period.

The analysis is based on the estimation of multiple output distance function for 24 EU countries using the FADN date covering the period 2004 - 2011. The results show that technological change had a positive contribution to the production possibilities in almost all countries. Moreover, the biased rather than Hicks neutral technological change was estimated. The direction of biased technological change is country specific. Efficiency differences were found to be important reasons for variation in the production in 12 countries. The top 10 % farmers highly exploit their production possibilities. This also holds for average farm. On the other hand, 10 % of the worst farmers waste their resources and may have problems to compete on the market. Moreover, we can observe significant differences in TFP levels among EU member countries. In particular, the old member states have on average higher TFP level as compared to new member states. Technical change was identified as the important factor of TFP development.","[Cechura, Lukas] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Hockmann, Heinrich] IAMO, Halle, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Cechura, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",cechura@pef.czu.cz; hockmann@iamo.de,"Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018","Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874",,,,,19,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,90,98,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600009,0

In EU 10% of farms report that they have additional revenue activity directly associated with the farm. A higher percentage of commercial farms (13.5%) have other revenue activities as well. The research results point to the obvious inequality between particular EU countries concerning the mentioned aspects. This further suggests that, primarily is necessary to consider transitional issues, and that an implementation of the successful projects within area of rural economy diversification will represent the next research challenge. The importance of market chains for realization of added value within the wider rural economy, mobilization of the local endogenous capacities and resources in rural areas, advancement of economic activities and creation of employment opportunities for the rural population, as well as the emphasis on the territorial LEADER approach, are the objectives that support the concept of diversification in the EU rural development policy and its orientation towards the multi-sectoral approach, which particularly emphasize the importance of micro and small rural entrepreneurs in implementation of these goals. The aim of the paper is to identify possibilities of diversification of economic activities in rural areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), given that BiH has good preconditions for development of rural economy through diversification of activities on the farm. Primary sources of data were collected through the survey of farms that have or expect to have diversified activities on the farm, while the secondary data were collected from domestic and foreign scientific and professional literature sources.

The analysis is focused in the Northeast and South regions, the most vulnerable to ENSO effects in Brazil. We adopt a three-stage approach. First, we specify a spline regression model relating sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the Pacific to weather conditions in Brazilian municipalities. Then, we specify a second group of regressions aimed at assessing how temperature and precipitation in Brazilian municipalities determine crop yields. Finally, with the estimated coefficients provided by the regressions of the early stages, we conduct simulation exercises to evaluate the impacts of ENSO on crop yields. Simulation results show that corn and bean production are quite more vulnerable to El Nino effects in the Northeast region, with productivity losses reaching 50%. The critical impact on corn and bean has important socioeconomic consequences, since these crops are mainly produced by household farmers. We also found that the impact of La Nina in the South region is quite significant for all the crops. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Social media depends on mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss and modify user-generated content. This study attempted to identify the methods used by students when seeking a placement for their internship and whether they find social media as an effective tool to apply for their internship placement. The study employed qualitative method and data was collected through several semi-structured interviews which probed the students' use (or lack of use) of social media when applying for a placement for their student internship. The interviews were conducted with a small selected group of students who had undergone an internship program. It was found that while a few of the respondents used social media when applying for their internship placement, most did not. In terms of the implication of this study, organizations could be able to employ the best practices when selecting students for an industrial training in the organizations. While levels of awareness and adoption continue to develop both for recruiters and student's internship programmes, organizations must consider adding social media to their overall online recruitment strategy to meet the goals of being cost-effective, competitive, targeted and strategic when sourcing for top talents.

Cost optimization is an important role for all of the companies. This fact also can be apply for the companies operates in wood processing industry. In the wood processing industry play adhesives important role and they are important secondary materials in furniture industry also. Adhesives significantly contribute to improving the products quality and they are also the basis for the development of new improved wood products. The main goal of the article is to promote the possibility of foamed adhesives using as a chance for the costs saving during the production of solid wood panels. The methods of our research are focused on the increasing of adhesive volume by foaming technology using the standard STN 13 354. Just through this technology adhesive can be applied to the bonding area more efficiently. It creates opportunities for applying of less volume of adhesive in bonded joints and on the other hand for obtaining the comparable strength requirements as the conventional volume of un-foamed adhesive. Based on our results it is possibility to reduce dispersion adhesive volume at 22%. From our research can be conclude that adhesives foaming is a technology that allows achieving the desired bonding strength at significantly reduced spread rate of adhesives and has also positive economic aspects in the production. Cost savings can be strong competitive advantage for plenty of companies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study draws upon an ethnographic field study from a large on-going hospital construction project in Denmark, and focuses on the early phases of on-boarding the design team into the project organisation. The theoretical contribution concerns the ways in which project visualisations plays an active role in developing novel conceptions of space and how these are mobilized in the process of on-boarding, in terms of 1. Design space (especially the engagement of users in the design process), 2. Organisational space (work processes and their spatial-temporal dimension) and; 3. Economic space (cost estimations and budgets). In practice, our findings show that the visualisations of different yet connected project spaces and the development of future clinical practices is related to a number of emergent concerns in the processes of designing and constructing the new hospital, notably concerns and tensions between innovation and control.

The first is to reconsider the evolution of the Romanian manufacturing industry from the historical perspective of the last two decades. The second is to forecast changes to Romanian industrial structures as a result of globalisation, the European integration of the Romanian industry, the industrial policies and strategies being adopted and, not least, the financial and economic crisis, which is estimated to be the most severe since the Second World War. This complex process, involving every component of the socio-economic system, requires adequate policies, strategies and tools to manage the potential negative phenomena which may arise. The design of active industrial policies for targeted restructuring which are capable of achieving the gradual elimination of existing structural distortions is a complex problem with any number of technological, economic and social variables and implications. Furthermore, such industrial policy tools would also need to be aimed at restarting industrial production and, in the longer term, increasing the productivity and competitiveness of Romanian industry in both domestic and external markets. Having evaluated the current status of the Romanian manufacturing industry and identified the existing foundations for its future development, this paper concludes by suggesting possible scenarios for the evolution of the Romanian manufacturing industry over the course of the next decade.

Rural Community Schools are a relatively new phenomenon in the Czech Republic - they were established in 2005 and have mainly been functioning since 2010. Therefore, the questions are whether Rural Community Schools are now firmly rooted within other organisations promoting rural development and what comprises their key activities. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate the various activities of Rural Community Schools within the context of rural development, to create a typology of these activities and mainly to answer the research question: whether and to what extent these activities are in accordance with the concept of community-led rural development. Attention is also paid to the regional perspectives of these activities. From the general perspective, the paper is based on concepts of local endogenous development and community education. The paper consists of the first results of sociological research, which combines the techniques of document study and questioning - in particular, semi-standardised interviews. The semi-standardised interviews were conducted with the main actors (Community Coordinators) of chosen Rural Community Schools in the Czech Republic. The first results of the sociological research have a mainly qualitative character, whereby it is possible to classify three basic types of activities of Rural Community Schools in the Czech Republic - the first are activities to increase opportunities on the labour market, the second have the mission of promoting active citizenship (local development) and the third are focused on the personal growth of participants. The third type primarily seems to be the most important within the context of rural development, but is still the least represented within Rural Community School activities.","[Husak, Jakub; Hadkova, Sarka] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Husák, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",husak@pef.czu.cz; hadkova@pef.czu.cz,"Husák, Jakub/T-5876-2017","Husák, Jakub/0000-0001-7166-9252",,,,,13,4,4,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,191,198,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600020,0

It uses a unique household level panel data set, which spans more than two decades (1987-2008), from rural Bangladesh. We find that households' access to microfinance reduces the incidence of borrowing from informal sources, but not the amount of borrowing. We find that less poor households benefit more in terms of reducing their reliance on informal borrowing and that the benefit accrues over time. We also find that having access to microfinance increases women's informal borrowing for small consumption usage, without facilitating access to new business opportunities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

From a time-domain view, our findings show strong but not homogenous links between money growth and inflation in the mid-1990s and the period since the early 2000s. Especially since the early 2000s, China's monetary policy has achieved much better performance in terms of inflation management compared to previous years. From a frequency-domain view, we find that money growth and inflation are positively related in one-to-one fashion in the medium or long run whereas they deviates from such a positive relation in the short run due to temporary shocks and significant lag effects. We can also conclude for China that the long-run relationship between M-0 growth and inflation supports the modern quantity theory of money (QTM), while the medium-run relationship between M-1 growth and inflation as well as My growth and inflation supports the modern QTM. In general, however, our results fit well with the fact that China has experienced economic transitions and structural adjustments in monetary policy over the past two decades.

The gravity model estimation is backed by a price-wedge framework that identifies technical barriers (equivalent to tariffs) that could be restricting South Africa's orange exports. The simulation of the gravity equation shows that removing technical barriers will have a 0.1% increase in South Africa's orange exports to the EU, suggesting that the growth potential of the EU market is somewhat limited by some additional factors such as low demand growth, and South Africa's diversion to higher-return markets. Nonetheless, reducing technical barriers still has a fairly significant impact on South Africa's other major markets, particularly China, the United States, Canada and Russia. This is an important result, not only because the analysis generally affirms the tightening of technical barriers in key markets, but also because the analysis unpacks the cross sectional idiosyncrasies of technical barriers across major export markets.","Agbiz, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Kapuya, T (通讯作者)，Agbiz, Grain Bldg,1st Floor, Pretoria, South Africa.",tinashe@gmail.co.za,,,WTO Chairs Small Research Grant under the University of Mauritius,WTO Chairs Small Research Grant under the University of Mauritius,"I would like to thank Masego Moobi and the seminar participants at the Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa (AEASA) Conference held in October 2014, at Mpekweni Resort for their comments.

For that reason, the paper analyzes both, the current problems in the pension system functioning and those that will in long-term represent an even more serious threat. Resolution of these issues, meaning stabilization of the existing pension system of intergenerational risk sharing, appears to be a necessary precondition for the reform that is opening of the system for private types of pension insurance.

While five of the six measures are significantly correlated with this benchmark, this is only because they are correlated with the specialist participation rate.

To the former such investigation provides a useful aid for efficient diversification of their investment portfolios. To the latter identification of significance of impact of certain factors on international investment flows may provide a proof for violation of efficient market hypothesis, which, if found, will have far-reaching implications for the theory of finance. Despite being an innovative modern scheme for international investment allocation mutual funds still are puzzling from the viewpoint of factors, which determine the status of a particular fund or national fund industry to be or not to be attractive for international investment flows. Most of existing studies focus on effect which individual fund characteristics have on inducing of foreign and domestic capital to flow in or out of a particular mutual fund and there is an evident gap in knowledge about factors which determine the attractiveness of an individual economy and its mutual fund industry for international portfolio flows. In the light of the stated above the paper aims to study the determinants of mutual fund flows in advanced and emerging economies of the Asia Pacific region by means of portfolio flows gravity framework. Application of such framework gives a threefold result: (1) it allows to model simple gravity-type relations between country mutual fund industry characteristics and international portfolio flows in the Asian Pacific region; (2) it allows to analyze the changing structure of the regional mutual fund flows along two intensive and extensive - margins; and (3) by decomposing the sample into advanced and emerging economies, it allows to track differences across development stages and document important country and regional characteristics.","[Lemeshko, Oleksandra; Koncikova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Dept Econ, Lipova 5a, Brno 60100, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Lemeshko, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Dept Econ, Lipova 5a, Brno 60100, Czech Republic.",lemeshko@mail.muni.cz; 207077@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,349,358,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200047,0

A mixed method approach, utilizing informal interviews and a household survey in Chiapas, Mexico, analyzed three coffee trading regimes: independent, non-affiliated farmers, and growers in cooperatives pursuing a fair trade or vertical integration strategy. Survey and econometric results indicate that concentration on specialty coffee production with a portfolio of foreign contracts is economically preferable to a vertically integrated cooperative, which in turn produces more favorable coffee prices for smallholders than the non-affiliated conventional, coyote-dominated trading system.","[Luna, Fatima] Sonoran Inst, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA; [Wilson, Paul N.] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Wilson, PN (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, POB 210023, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",fluna@sonoraninstitute.org; pwilson@ag.arizona.edu,,,,,,,41,10,14,1,26,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The analysis of the contributions of the different clusters included in the SuWaNu project has provided a detailed description of the reclaimed water sector in the European agriculture. After the analysis of more than 200 strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats provided by the partners of the project, this study includes a complete description of the use of reclaimed water in the European agriculture. These findings have been used as the fundamental cognition for the development of a joint action plan and several other business plans in the selected regions.

CSR reports, respectively triple-bottom-line reports have become tool of communication for Corporate Social Responsibility. Those are a voluntary comprehensive reports involving not only economic data, but also information from environmental and social field. These reports tell about the company policy in relationship to the environment, sustainability, or there are directly focused on fulfilling the commitments accepted by the company within the concept of social responsibility.

Malaysia was not an exception that received an impact where stock market suffered large losses during crisis. KLCI fall below its benchmarks, which is below 1000 points. While stock market experience high volatility during crisis, bond market is one investment alternative for investors to shift from risky asset to reduce risk of loss. In this case, investors should shift their investment from stock to bond to reduce risk of loss during crisis. This behaviour is called flight-to-quality. Flight-to-quality refers to a sudden shift in investment behaviours in a period of economic crisis. Thus, this paper is conducted with the objectives to analyze the existence of flight from stock to bond (FTQ); There are three data set which employed; before crisis, during crisis and after crisis. The daily stock indices and bond indices are collected from January 2006 until December 2014.

We review real estate development models and project management. Project models typically describe a project process as a linear development, from idea, through decisions, execution and delivery. Real estate development projects are no exception. However, reality frequently feed surprises into real estate development projects, creating needs for iterations, where the projects need to be re-defined. We also review agile methods used in IT-projects. The logic in these methods is iterative. This iterative aspect in IT-projects is relevant to real estate development projects as well. This means that real estate development projects have similarities with IT-projects, where the need for iterative development has contributed to the development of agile methods. We illustrate applications of the model, and corresponding time use in the development process. We find that there is significant variation in the time use, along with need for iterations. The time needed for processing a regulation plan in Norway is found to be minimum about one year, but it may take two years or more. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

The methodological approach is a mixed-methods case study: we started our research by performing an exploratory qualitative study at SEBN MA, that were used to contextualize our research model. This model was then tested through a quantitative study by adopting a hypothetico-deductive methodology and using data collected by questionnaire. An analysis of these data by the technique of structural equation modeling confirms that information quality plays a key role in increasing user satisfaction and intention to use of the system; the significance of the relationship between the quality of service and the use of the IS; the effect of both intention to use and use on individual impact and finally the positive influence of the individual impact on the organizational performance of XPPS. This article provides an empirical validation of the IS success model developed by DeLone and McLean in the automotive industry, a little investigated topic in the literature, and shows the managerial implications of using such a model.

The financial development, fiscal balance and terms of trade are positively correlated with the current account balance, while openness to international trade is negatively correlated with the current account balance.

The understanding and awareness of people and taxable person about GST can be seen from the success of the advertisements and programs held by the Royal Malaysian Custom Departments (RMCD) and other government agencies throughout 2014 onwards. GST is known as a multi-stages tax affected to each stage of products or services circulation. In other words, there will be 6% tax imposed on all goods and services with some exception on certain items. Therefore, RMCD shall look after GST governance to ensure that taxable entities are continuously complying with all the regulations enforced under GST Act 2014, GST Rules 2014 and GST Order 2014. The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection are very important for government to support the socioeconomic development of the country. GST governance as a process in guiding an entity with regards to their tax responsibilities will lead the entity to be more concerned about their contributions to the nation building. This study discusses the GST governance from overseas practices such as governance and risk management, processing and reporting, resources and capabilities and assurance that can be adapted into Malaysian context for best practice actions.

Frequently households and firms come under default threat, local governments can default, and recently sovereign default threats were eminent for Greece and Spain in 2012-2013. Moreover, Argentina experienced an actual default in 2001. What causes sovereign default risk, and what are the escape routes from default risk? Previous studies such as Arellano (2008), Roch and Uhlig (2013), and Arellano et al. (2014) have provided theoretical models to explore the main dynamics of sovereign defaults. These models can be characterized as threshold models in which there is a convergence toward a good no-default equilibrium below the threshold and a default equilibrium above the threshold. However, in these models aggregate output is exogenous, so that important macroeconomic feedback effects are not taken into account. In this chapter, we (1) propose alternative model variants suitable for certain types of countries in the EU where aggregate output is endogenously determined and where financial stress plays a key role, (2) show how these model variants can be solved through the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control numerical technique, and (3) present some empirical evidence on the nonlinear dynamics of output, sovereign debt, and financial stress in some euro areas and other industrialized countries.","[Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Semmler, Willi] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Proano, Christian R.] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Bamberg, Germany; [Proano, Christian R.] Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Dusseldorf, Germany",The New School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159; Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,49,3,3,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,163,193,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024018,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900007,0

It is one of the most important models in asset pricing theory and on how to measure risk and the relation between expected return and risk. The result of this relation is beta coefficient, known as market beta or systematic risk of assets. Even though it is subject to a lot of criticism with respect to its validity, after more than 50 years of existence, it is still widely used by many academics and practitioners.

It is for the first time in the history of integration, that the concept of social market economy found its way into the Treaty objectives. At the same time, however, the EU has not been given any specific powers to actively develop social policies. The social market economy objective is therefore largely seen as a requirement for a more balanced approach in situations where liberalizing logic of the internal market and its economic freedoms collides with social rights and security systems, which are traditionally strong in many EU countries. Such understanding of the social market economy objective increases the role of European Court of Justice (CIEU), as the Member States, in their capacity of legislators, have not shown so far any willingness to modify by legislative acts the relationship between economic freedoms and social rights. In the pre-Lisbon period the CJEU disappointed the left side of the EU's political spectrum by several of its judgments in which the judges gave priority to economic freedoms over social rights. It is therefore interesting to put on review whether the CJEU has accepted the signal brought about by changes in the primary law of the EU and whether it has approached differently the balance between economic freedoms and social rights in the name of achieving the EU's objective of social market economy.","[Smejkal, Vaclav] Skoda Auto Univ, Ops, Dept Law, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University,"Smejkal, V (通讯作者)，Skoda Auto Univ, Ops, Dept Law, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic.",vaclav.smejkal@savs.cz,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,800,809,,,,,,10,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300085,0

According to a European Commission report during the period 2008 - 2011 more than 90,000 Greek SMEs were closed. In five years the economic crisis has affected almost all sectors of the economy. The best performance was achieved by the sector of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), which showed impressive growth particularly in the period 2011-2012 as it benefited from the favorable terms of the institutional framework, namely subsidies. In 2011, as part of research findings that emerged after the implementation of the Community Initiative Equal, the state established the institution of social entrepreneurship. Three categories of enterprises are included in the third sector of the economy, namely the social sector that occupies a wide range of business activities ranging from the production activities and the services supply to vulnerable population groups, to the labor market integration of vulnerable groups. However until now an important part of this sector of the economy, could not be moved dynamically in the field of competition. The institution should be supported, strengthened by the state, not through the provision of subsidies or financial incentives, but in terms of assistance.

However, the geographical distance between the trading countries, and the GDP per capita differences have negative effect on trade flow.

However, ARIMA model cannot effectively capture nonlinear patterns hidden in a time series. As a nonlinear model, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) can be applied to time series forecasting with a high degree of accuracy. Combining ARIMA model and LSSVM may further improve the prediction performance. It can helps investors making investment decisions to forecast stock index effectively.

The data set comprises a total of 297 enterprises that participated in the research. The research was carried out via oral questioning and the main instrument was a questionnaire. The research has shown that the most commonly applied diversification strategy of Czech companies is a concentration strategy. Furthermore, it was found out that the majority of Czech companies operate in the geographical sub-region of Eastern Europe. When choosing the target foreign market Czech companies are influenced by many factors. The greatest influence on the choice of a target foreign market has market variables.","[Zapletalova, Sarka] Moravian Univ Coll Olomouc, Dept Econ, Tr Kosmonautu 1288-1, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic",,"Zapletalová, S (通讯作者)，Moravian Univ Coll Olomouc, Dept Econ, Tr Kosmonautu 1288-1, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic.",szapletalova@hotmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,998,1007,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000108,0

Firms can allocate costly external finance to productive capital, or to liquid assets with low physical returns. If firms raise costly external finance and accumulate liquidity, either the cost of external finance is relatively low or the total return to liquidity accumulation, including its shadow value as future internal funds, is particularly high. We formalize this intuition by estimating a dynamic model of firms' financing and savings decisions, and use our model along with firm level data to construct an empirical estimate of the average cost of external finance from 1980 to 2014.

Using newly collected data on the ultimate ownership structure of publicly traded firms in nine East Asian economies, we find that family-controlled firms exhibit lower CSR performance, consistent with the expropriation hypothesis of family control. The negative relationship between family control and CSR is robust to alternative measures of family control, different components of CSR, as well as to endogeneity tests, subsample tests, and alternative estimation methods. We further find that CSR underperformance concentrates in family firms with greater agency problems and in countries with weaker institutions. Moreover, the underperformance of East Asian family firms holds when controlling for the effects of other large shareholders and when comparing with family firms from other countries. These findings contribute to understanding the determinants of CSR and highlight the importance of corporate governance and the institutional environment in improving CSR performance of family-controlled firms.

Although these links are better established for civil wars or conventional conflict, we believe that the same logic should be applicable to ethnic terrorism as well. If so, can reforms towards greater ethnic inclusion also reduce terrorist risks? We argue that reform and changes towards greater ethnic inclusion and democratization should induce substitution and reduce the volume of terrorist violence, even if attacks by splinter groups may persist. We develop propositions on terrorist attack frequency, given group characteristics and accommodation. We take advantage of the large changes towards democratization, decreased discrimination, and increased ethnic accommodation since the third wave of democratization and the end of the Cold War, as well as new data linking domestic terrorist organization in the Global Terrorism Data to specific ethnic groups in the Ethnic Power Relations data.

We numerically solve for the optimal managed relocation policy in a spatial-dynamic bioeconomic model. The model includes three sites where climate change causes the local productivity of a beneficial species to change over time. The optimal policy is characterized by complex transient dynamics that reflect productivity trends, the local benefit of the species, and the cost of relocation. Given concerns about the impact of a relocated species on destination ecosystems, we consider the implications of blocking relocation to a site. We also compare optimal managed relocation to the relocation policy that achieves a future population distribution with the least investment.","[Kling, David M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sanchirico, James N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sanchirico, James N.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Oregon State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Resources for the Future; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Kling, DM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",david.kling@oregonstate.edu; jsanchirico@ucdavis.edu; wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,65,9,9,0,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The empirical evidence suggests that economic freedom is strongly related to income inequality. However, not all areas of economic freedom affect income distribution similarly. Government size is robustly associated with inequality, and also when controlling for potential endogeneity in a dynamic panel data analysis. Regulation is linked to income inequality as well, whereas legal system and sound money have no significant effects on income distribution. In the case of freedom to trade internationally, the relationship differs between old (EU-15) and new (former socialist) EU countries.","[Perez-Moreno, Salvador] Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Malaga, Spain; [Angulo-Guerrero, Maria J.] Univ Malaga, Dept Business Management, Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga,"Pérez-Moreno, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Malaga, Spain.",sperezmoreno@uma.es,"Pérez Moreno, Salvador/H-2290-2015","Pérez Moreno, Salvador/0000-0001-5207-7219",,,,,53,16,16,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Our results are based on a proprietary dataset of high-frequency investor sentiment, which is computed based on a comprehensive textual analysis of sources from news wires, internet news sources, and social media. We find substantial evidence that intraday S&P 500 index returns are predictable using lagged half-hour investor sentiment. The predictive power is also found in other stock and bond index ETFs. We document that this sentiment effect is independent of the intraday momentum effect, which is based on lagged half-hour returns. While the intraday momentum effect only exists in the last half hour, the sentiment effect persists in at least the last two hours of a trading day. From an investment perspective, high-frequency investor sentiment also appears to have significant economic value when evaluated with market timing trading strategies.

While regulatory responses exist, their effectiveness is questionable with relatively little use of market-based instruments. We focus on the challenges associated with measuring and developing policy to sustain natural capital and ecosystem services.

While some scholars highlight advances in local democratic accountability, others emphasize the dangers of decentralized governance when democratic practices are poorly institutionalized. This paper studies the case of health politics in Indonesian local government to contend that the focus on democratic accountability and good governance may be insufficient to explain major policy outcomes associated with decentralization. I show that the quality of local democracy affects health insurance policy during the first stages of the decentralization process. However, to understand policy trajectories over a longer time frame, relations between politicians at different levels of government become the crucial factor. Using original qualitative and quantitative data from nearly 400 Indonesian districts and provinces, I find that regions in which cooperation between provincial and district authorities has emerged display systematically higher levels of health insurance coverage. I explain why multi-level cooperation improves local policy outcomes, and I show that the positive effect of cooperation does not depend exclusively on patronage networks. These findings contribute to the literature on decentralization and development by showing that policy cooperation across levels of government is crucial for the implementation of complex social policies, and that multi-level cooperation can have beneficial effects even when local democratic institutions are weak.

However, a growing number of studies, report that community-based approaches are experiencing formidable challenges, with limited outcomes in terms of livelihoods, decentralization and sustainability. Yet, policies continue to focus attention unduly on community participation, ignoring the ways in which the community is itself embedded in a wider social system. Recent studies have shown that local communities are more complex than previously assumed, with local community actions being heavily shaped by wider social and environmental contexts. Yet, scholarly research tends to focus on reporting such cross-scalar dynamics, with little explanation of how and why they occur. This paper advances a framework to understand how local communities interact with the wider world, through what we term delocalization of communities in natural resource management. Using Bourdieu's theory of social field, we present an approach to analyze various trajectories of delocalization involving the exchange of, and struggle for, a variety of resources valued in specific fields of natural resource governance. We extend the work of several researchers who have been critical of the conventional view of the community, and argue that a new model of delocalized community needs to be envisaged, one that emphasizes the interactions among actors within and between spatial scales and levels of political organization. While such a cross-scalar view is not novel, we deepen social field approach to assess how cross-scalar processes unfold in the course of delocalization of communities in the context of rapid social and environmental change. We draw on evidence from five different case studies from three continents that demonstrate specific aspects of the delocalization phenomenon. The cases selected are from Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea. We demonstrate through these cases that increasingly diverse interests in natural resources such as forests have served to delocalize communities beyond local domains. We conclude that local community is not a localized entity, and there are multiple cross-scale networks which need to be recognized, as these have profound implications in community-based natural resource management. In such situations, open and exploratory approaches - moving away from blueprint interventions - are required to facilitate context-specific fields and spheres of local democracy, nurturing diverse, flexible, and networked models of community participation, along with the recognition of political and economic influence coming from the wider domain.

In two studies, we investigated two factors that are expected to play a significant role in global judgments of perceived inflation: product accessibility and attitudes towards inflation. In Study 1 (N = 253), primed participants retrieved five products whose prices had increased (or decreased) in the past year before expressing a judgment of past inflation (versus non-primed participants with no retrieval task). In Study 2 (N = 101) participants were merely exposed to a series of products, and asked to estimate their frequency of purchase, before judging past inflation. In one condition, the prices of the majority of products had actually increased in the last year, while in another condition they had decreased. In both studies, attitudes towards inflation were also measured. Product priming consistently affected inflation judgments in the direction of an assimilation effect. Also, more negative attitudes towards inflation were associated with higher judgments of perceived inflation. Path analysis confirmed that both product accessibility and attitudes are potential bases for judgments of perceived inflation. These findings suggest that multiple psychological influences may underlie global judgments of perceived inflation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the Hybrid Public Good experiment each of two interacting contributors chooses an independent contribution level as well as three adjusted contribution levels when (s)he, as the only adjusting player, learns that the other's independent contribution is smaller, equal or larger than the own one. To approximate the border cases of simultaneous contributing as well as sequential contributions we systematically vary the probability that one player can adjust, based on such qualitative information, but maintain that no adaptation at all and adaptation by only one occurs with positive probability. Adaptation is framed in two ways, once by additively changing the own independent contribution and once by stating new contribution levels. Surprisingly, the framing effect becomes stronger with experience. Reacting to coinciding independent contributions implies impressive conformity in contributing. Reacting to higher, respectively lower independent contributions implies average upward, and, more strongly, downward adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we calculate monthly probabilities of default (PDs) for a large sample of European firms and break them down into systematic and idiosyncratic components. The approach that we follow does not require data on credit spreads, thus it can also be applied to small firms that do not have such data available. In accordance with theory, we find that the systematic part, measured as the PD sensitivity to aggregate default risk, is positively related to stock returns. We show that stocks with higher PDs underperform because they have, on average, higher idiosyncratic risk. Finally, small and value stocks are quite heterogeneous with respect to their exposure to aggregate default risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An equilibrium model with rare disasters followed by recoveries helps reconcile theory with empirical observations. Indeed, recoveries outweigh the upward-sloping effect of time-varying disaster intensity and expected growth, generating downward-sloping term structures of dividend growth risk, equity return volatility, and equity risk premia. In addition, the term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping when accounting for recoveries and downward-sloping otherwise.

While most of the papers on this topic are drawn from (emerging) Latin American, Asian or some African countries, Madagascar represents an interesting case. So far, very few studies in general, even less so in Sub-Saharan Africa, used panel data to provide evidence of the informal sector heterogeneity. Taking advantage of the 1-2-3 Surveys in Madagascar, a four-wave panel dataset (2000-04), we assess the magnitude of various formal/informal sector earnings gaps. Is there an informal sector job earnings penalty? Do some informal sector jobs provide pecuniary premiums and which ones? Do possible gaps vary along the earnings distribution? Ignoring distributional issues is indeed a strong limitation, given the compound question of how informality affects earnings inequality. We address heterogeneity issues at three different levels: the worker, the employment status (wage employment vs. self-employment) and the earnings distribution. Standard earnings equations are estimated at the mean and at various conditional quantiles of the earnings distribution. The results suggest that the sign and magnitude of the formal informal sector earnings gaps highly depend on the workers' employment status and on their relative position in the earnings distribution. In the case of a poor and fragile country like Madagascar, these findings provide new and robust empirical backups for the existence of a mix between the traditional exclusion vs. exit hypotheses of the informal sector.

Using survey data and econometric analysis, they show that fishermen are more likely to diversify their income when the degradation of the fish stock is more severe.

The latter relates to low levels of formal education among fishermen and the unregulated use of highly productive, but damaging, fishing gear. These two factors result in a high return to fishing relative to non-fishing activities, even amid degradation.","[Stoop, Nik; Verpoorten, Marijke] Univ Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Waaistr 6, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Stoop, Nik; Verpoorten, Marijke] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [Stoop, Nik] Res Fdn Flanders, Brussels, Belgium; [Houssa, Romain] Univ Namur, Ctr Res Econ Dev, Namur, Belgium; [Houssa, Romain] Univ Namur, Ctr Res Finance & Management, Namur, Belgium; [Houssa, Romain] Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Antwerp; University of Namur; University of Namur; KU Leuven,"Stoop, N (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Waaistr 6, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.;Stoop, N (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Antwerp, Belgium.;Stoop, N (通讯作者)，Res Fdn Flanders, Brussels, Belgium.",nik.stoop@kuleuven.be; romain.houssa@unamur.be; marijke.verpoorten@uantwerpen.be,"; Verpoorten, Marijke/J-7783-2015","Stoop, Nik/0000-0003-0787-8038; Verpoorten, Marijke/0000-0003-1619-3030","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [S_2/2_2012, F_6/12_2010]; Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance (LICOS); ACROPOLIS (Academic Research Group for Policy Support)",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance (LICOS); ACROPOLIS (Academic Research Group for Policy Support),"The authors thank participants at seminars and conferences in Leuven (LICOS seminar and EAAE workshop), Oxford (CSAE conference), Antwerp (IOB research day) and Berlin (DIW) for helpful comments and suggestions.

We provide robust evidence that inside debt has a positive effect on short-maturity debt and that this effect is concentrated in financially unconstrained firms that face lower refinancing risk. Our analysis further shows that CEO inside debt helps reduce the cost of debt financing. Overall, our results indicate that managerial holdings of inside debt facilitate access to external debt financing and reduce refinancing risk, thus incentivizing managers to use less costly shorter term debt.

This paper combines these two strands of literature and empirically analyses the export pricing behaviour of Chinese and Indian exporters in 1994-2007 whilst considering 6-digit product-level CA at the intercept and at the slope. Previous ERPT estimates that did not take product-level CA into account are biased as CA is significant in both cases. ERPT is more incomplete in high CA products but export prices increase with export specialization because a stronger presence in export markets allows higher market power. If China were to let its currency float, Chinese exporters' pricing strategy would become a classic case of incomplete ERPT. On the contrary, Indian exporters' pricing strategy remains robust regardless of the exchange rate regime. This result supports recent calls for the adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime, particularly in the case of China (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The resulting overall ranking is less affected by estimation uncertainty and model risk. We apply our methodology to disentangle the common signal and the idiosyncratic components from a selection of key systemic risk rankings that have been proposed recently. We use a sample of 113 listed financial sector firms in the European Union over the period 2002-2013. The implied ranking from the principal components is less volatile than most individual risk rankings and leads to less turnover among the top ranked institutions. We also find that price-based rankings and fundamentals-based rankings deviated substantially and for a prolonged time in the period leading up to the financial crisis. We test the adequacy of our newly pooled systemic risk ranking by relating it to credit default swap premia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We theoretically prove the negative relationship between the centrality of assets in this financial market network and their optimal weights under the Markowitz framework. Therefore, optimal portfolios overweight low-central securities to avoid the large variances that result when highly influential stocks are included in the investor's opportunity set. Next, we empirically investigate the major financial and market determinants of stock's centralities. The evidence indicates that highly central nodes tend to coincide with older, larger-cap, cheaper and financially riskier securities. Finally, we explore by means of in-sample and out-of-sample analysis the extent to which the structure of the stock market network can be employed to improve the portfolio selection process. We propose a network-based investment strategy that outperforms well-known benchmarks while presenting positive and significant Carhart alphas. The major contribution of the paper is to employ the financial market network as a useful device to improve the portfolio selection process by targeting a group of assets according to their centrality.

The proposal would dramatically reduce the tax significance of the source of corporate profits and the residence of corporations, both of which can be easily manipulated Lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent would encourage a flow of capital into the United States and reduce incentives to shift reported profits overseas and to engage in inversion transactions, while continuing to impose tax on foreigners who earn economic rents from investing in the United States. The proposal includes provisions for averaging of mark-to-market income, transition relieffor firms that move from closely held to publicly traded status, and other measures to address the challenges of mark-to-market taxation.

Given conformity of preferences, technologies, and shocks, both models reduce to equilibrium difference equations that coincide unless price distortions are differentially imposed on cash prices, across models. Equal distortions support equally large welfare costs of inflation. Performance differences stem from unequal assumptions about the pricing mechanism that governs cash transactions, not the differential modeling of the monetary exchange process.","[Camera, Gabriele] Chapman Univ, Econ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Camera, Gabriele] Univ Basel, WWZ, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Chien, Yili] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Basel; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Camera, G (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Econ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA.;Camera, G (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, WWZ, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",camera@chapman.edu; yilichien@gmail.com,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197; Camera, Gabriele/0000-0001-5548-2033",NSF [CCF-1101627],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank an editor and two anonymous referees for helpful suggestions, C.

To address the potential endogeneity caused by social factors that may effect both the gender composition of business owners and economic growth, we apply an instrumental variable strategy. Intriguingly, in-depth analysis yielded no evidence of positive agglomeration effects on job growth specifically from gendered measures of firm density. However, the analyses do illuminate the value of considering both the previously unexplored employer/nonemployer firm distinction as well as a gendered perspective of firm ownership in the understanding of regional growth factors. The results show that male-owned firms, particularly male-owned employer firms, have a strong, though negative, relationship to employment growth consistent with national employment trends in male-owned firms during the period of the study.","[Conroy, Tessa] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Weiler, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Colorado State University,"Conroy, T (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tessa.conroy@wisc.edu,,,,,,,52,16,20,4,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In existing models on contagion via interbank credit, external shocks to banks often spread to other banks only in case of a default. In contrast, shocks are transmitted also via asset devaluations and deteriorations in the credit quality in our algorithm. First, the probability of default (PD) of those banks directly affected by some shock increases. This increases the expected loss of the credit portfolios of the initially affected banks' counterparties, thereby reducing the counterparties' regulatory capital ratio. From a logistic regression we estimate the increase in the counterparties' PD due to a reduced capital ratio. Their increased PDs in turn affect the counterparties' counterparties, and so on. This coherent and flexible framework is applied to the bilateral interbank credit exposure of the entire German banking system in order to examine policy questions. For that purpose, we propose to measure the potential cost of contagion of a given shock scenario by the aggregated regulatory capital loss computed in our algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sheds light on how the corporate governance mechanisms adopted by firms on the newly established Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in China influence their use of debt. We find that the financial leverage of GEM firms is positively influenced by executives' shareholding and their excess cash compensation. Ownership concentration appears to reduce leverage, whereas the percentage of tradable shares increases leverage. In contrast, institutional investors' shareholding does not influence the level of debt. Traditional factors such as tax and operating cash flow are insignificant in explaining the debt levels among GEM firms.","[Huang, Wei] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Boateng, Agyenim] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Law Econ Accountancy & Risk, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Newman, Alexander] Deakin Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Glasgow Caledonian University; Deakin University,"Huang, W (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",Wei.Huang@nottingham.edu.cn; Agyenim.Boateng@gcu.ac.uk; A.Newman@deakin.edu.au,"Newman, Alexander/AAH-7376-2020","Newman, Alexander/0000-0003-1170-8947",,,,,61,43,49,3,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Firms face a choice between participating in foreign markets through exports or investing abroad to relocate production. The model predicts that the most productive firms invest abroad when exchange rate volatility is low and export otherwise, whereas the least productive firms invest abroad when volatility is high. Aggregation over heterogeneous firms produces a negative and nonlinear relation between exchange rate uncertainty and total international investment. An analysis of eighty-four developed and emerging economies over the 1996-2012 period provides empirical support for the model's predictions.","[Jeanneret, Alexandre] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Jeanneret, A (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,"Jeanneret, Alexandre/0000-0003-4628-1955",HEC Montreal; Institut de Finance Mathematigue de Montreal (IFM2),HEC Montreal; Institut de Finance Mathematigue de Montreal (IFM2),"The author acknowledges financial support from HEC Montreal and Institut de Finance Mathematigue de Montreal (IFM2) and thank Farid Radmehr for excellent research assistance.

Our contribution is to compare and contrast these indicators in the context of benefit analysis based on recent regulatory programs for nutrients in the US and EU. Results indicate order of magnitude differences in the benefits derived from the different types of indicators. We find support for a compound indicator that combines three policy-relevant indicators into an overall measure of waterbody health and is significantly related to property values.

Based on a sample of 3983 privatizations, which occurred from 1989 through 2008 in 55 countries, and using various measures of labor protection, we find that greater labor protection enhances the likelihood of share issue privatizations (SIPS). This result is robust to controls for political, legal, and economic factors and suggests that legally protected labor acquires enough power to be able to influence a government's choice of the privatization method. We also provide evidence that the positive effect of labor protection on the likelihood of SIPs is stronger (weaker) in countries where investors enjoy better (worse) legal protection, financial systems are more (less) developed, and when foreign investors are involved in the privatization offer.

We propose an extension of Neary and Tharakan's (2012) model, in which firms resort to external funders to finance investments in production capacities. Sectors differ in financial constraint and the cost of capital increases with the level of financial constraint. We first show that a weaker financial constraint allows firms to adopt a Cournot (rather than a Bertrand) pricing scheme and generate a high duopoly profit. Consequently, less financially constrained sectors are more likely to export. We also exhibit a new transmission channel of financial crisis. By increasing the financial cost of exporting and making it more difficult to engage in a Cournot behavior, a financial shock reduces both the intensive and extensive margins of trade.

We examine the validity of Taylor rules from the non-linear perspective and provide robust evidence that clearly indicates that PPP holds true for seven Central Eastern European countries. These results imply that the choices and effectiveness of the monetary policies in Central Eastern European economies are highly influenced by external factors that originate from the United States. Additionally, our findings highlight that these countries' RER convergence is a mean reversion towards the equilibrium values of Taylor rules in a nonlinear manner. Our findings mean capital mobility, exchange rate market efficiency and monetary integration are non-linear in these Central Eastern European countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although expected returns on equity REITs are highly correlated with their own volatility, the covariances of returns on REITs with the stock market premium, small stock premium, and value premium subsume the role of the volatility of REITs in explaining expected returns on REITs. The conditional betas of REITs associated with the stock market premium and the value premium, along with the conditional correlation between the two premiums, are more important than the volatility of the stock market or other factors in explaining the time variation of expected returns on REITs, especially during the recent financial crisis.

Even though the basic philosophy of TOD seems to be the same in all contexts, its specific applications greatly differ in form, function and impacts, calling for context-based TOD typologies that can help map these local specificities and better focus policy interventions. In recent years, TOD has also been widely advocated and applied in China; however, so far no study has systematically developed a TOD typology in a Chinese context. This paper fills this gap for the case of the Beijing metropolitan area. The approach is based on the node-place model, introduced by Bertolini (1996, 1999) to chart 'Transit' and 'Development' components, expanding it with a third, 'Oriented', dimension to quantify the degree of orientation of transit and development components towards each other. The paper reviewed the main TOD indicators in the international literature, selected those appropriate for the Beijing context, and classified the metro station areas into TOD types through a cluster analysis. The six identified types of metro station areas in Beijing demonstrate how the context-specific typology can support local urban and transport planners, designers and policymakers when considering future interventions.

The present analysis uses variation in corporate tax policy decisions of U.S. states over the period 1986 to 2012 to better understand the consequences of formulary apportionment, estimating the tax sensitivity of employment, investment, and sales. With the inclusion of adequate control variables, results indicate that economic activity is not sensitive to U.S. state corporate tax policy choices. Still, tax policy choices have important effects on corporate tax revenues.

Assuming that the industrial lobby has private information about the unfavorable environmental and/or health effects, but can be held liable for damage ex post, we derive the equilibrium properties of the contest. In particular, we derive conditions under which it is socially preferable for the regulator to decide according to the contest's outcome, rather than according to an ex ante cost-benefit analysis, using his prior beliefs.

Pleasantness ratings and psychophysiological responses, including facial electromyography, heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), and gaze deviation, were recorded. The main findings were as follows: (a) Corrugator muscle activation and GSR were associated with valence of the pictures; and (b) HRV parameters (mean R-R interval and root mean square of the successive differences) and zygomaticus muscle activity increased more when subjects viewed positive nonfood pictures than positive food pictures.

Agents exert effort to increase the likelihood of high outcome events and are additionally supplied actuarially fair private insurance for this earnings risk. This article is novel in its joint consideration of two sources of heterogeneity, two potential sources of insurance, and an endogenous ex post distribution of outcomes. The introduction of optimal private insurance eliminates the insurance benefit of social insurance, but leaves the redistributive benefit intact. An income effect induced by the crowding out of private insurance generates an additional benefit to social insurance when it takes the form of a linear income tax. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate how the relative contributions of ex ante and ex post risk differentially impact the welfare loss associated with setting optimal social insurance without recognizing the presence of private insurance.","[Lehr, Brandon] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Occidental College,"Lehr, B (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",lehr@oxy.edu,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Recent research has called for improved understanding of the relationship between family structure and economic preparation for retirement at earlier stages of the life course. Using multiple years of the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, we examined how number of children and marital status were associated with women's household retirement savings at young and mid-adulthood. Several household-level indicators of retirement preparation were considered: desire to save for retirement, retirement account ownership, eligibility to participate in a defined-contribution plan, participation in defined-contribution plans, and retirement account wealth. Results from regression analyses revealed variation in women's household financial preparation for retirement at young and mid-adulthood by family context. Additional children were negatively associated with several measures of retirement preparation among single-female households but not for couple households. Overall, we found that low economic preparation for retirement is an additional economic disadvantage facing single mothers at young and mid-adulthood, with potentially long-term implications for their financial security. The results shed light on linkages between family structure and women's economic status.","[Tamborini, Christopher R.; Purcell, Patrick] US Social Secur Adm, Off Retirement Policy, 500 E St, Washington, DC 20254 USA",,"Tamborini, CR (通讯作者)，US Social Secur Adm, Off Retirement Policy, 500 E St, Washington, DC 20254 USA.",Chris.Tamborini@ssa.gov; Patrick.Purcell@ssa.gov,,"Tamborini, Christopher/0000-0002-8198-3509",,,,,113,8,13,4,29,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The causal identification relies on the geographical variations in food (wheat) price. The results show that the negative impacts of food price increase on school enrolment differ by gender, economic status and the presence of siblings. The negative effects on school do not directly correspond to the increase in child labour because the transition from being idle to labour activity or from school to being idle is significant, particularly among poor girls. The results also show that children in households with access to agricultural lands are not affected by higher food prices. The analyses reveal a more dynamic picture of the impact of food price increase on child status and contribute to broader policy discussion to mitigate the impact of crises on child education.","[Hou, Xiaohui; Hong, Seo Yeon] World Bank Grp, South Asia Human Dev Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Scott, Kinnon] World Bank, Dept Dev Econ Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Hou, XH (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, South Asia Human Dev Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",xhou@worldbank.org,,,Trust Fund for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD); Gender Action Plan (GAP) Trust Fund,Trust Fund for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD); Gender Action Plan (GAP) Trust Fund,"The team thanks the government counterparts, especially the Benazir Income Support Program, Federal Bureau of Statistics, and the Ministry of Finance, for facilitating the technical work.

We develop a Bayesian model of inferring information from trade executions and show the conditions under which tick rules or bulk volume classification predominates. Empirically, we find that tick rule approaches and BVC are relatively good classifiers of the aggressor side of trading, but bulk volume classifications are better linked to proxies of information-based trading.

We show what drives a country to switch and how this affects the level of fuel taxes as well as incentives for other countries to also adopt the dual system. The model is partially able to explain the gradual extension of kilometer charging for trucks in Europe. The model also shows that, in the absence of diesel cars, the gradual introduction of kilometer charges will make fuel taxation for trucks virtually disappear and will lead to a system where truck use is (1) taxed mainly based on distance, (2) is taxed too heavily, and (3) where highest distance taxes are expected in transit countries with a strong market position. When the fuel tax must in addition serve as an externality tax for diesel cars, the introduction of distance charges for trucks will give rise to diesel taxes that are lower than the external cost of diesel cars. For trucks, this leads to a sum of diesel taxes and distance charges that are higher than the external cost of trucks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, these revenue-enhancing tariff-tax reforms have a critical shortcomingthey generally reduce welfare under imperfect competition. This paper shows that tax reforms such as consumption tax reforms do not necessarily have to be implemented to make up for revenue shortfalls from tariff reductions under imperfect competition, because trade liberalization through tariff cuts leads to an increase in government revenue when domestic and imported goods have a high substitutability. This revenue-enhancing effect of a tariff reduction occurs for a wider degree of product substitutability when initial tariff and consumption tax rates are high. More importantly, we show that even if initial tariff and consumption tax rates are sufficiently low, a tariff reduction still increases government revenue for a low degree of product differentiation under Bertrand competition.","[Shim, Kieun] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Busandaehak Ro 63beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Jeong, Kyonghwa] Mokpo Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonnam 58554, South Korea",Pusan National University; Mokpo National University,"Jeong, K (通讯作者)，Mokpo Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonnam 58554, South Korea.",shimke@pusan.ac.kr,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Given the ageing of the workforce, there is increasing interest in the human capital of older workers. The most recent research on wage patterns has adopted a new multidimensional skills/tasks approach. We argue that this approach is also well suited to the investigation of the evolution of the human capital of older workers. There is clear evidence that the typical concave Ben-Porath shape for a wage based single dimension human capital measure masks different shapes for the individual components in a multi-dimensional skill portfolio. Not all components evolve in the same way over the life-cycle. Some components of the skill vector are particularly sensitive to ageing effects for older workers, but this sensitivity is underestimated using occupation level rather than individual level skill observations. The evidence suggests that workers can and do adjust their skill portfolios in various ways as they approach retirement and that the decline in skills is not purely driven by selection.

Using data from the Tengzhou Household Travel Survey, this paper tests the relationships among land use patterns, activity participation and travel behavior, by comparing results from two structural equation models: one model without activity participation and a second model which adds activity participation as a mediating variable between land use patterns and travel behavior characteristics. The results suggest that the indirect effects through activity participation decision play important roles, which may reinforce the direct effects of land use patterns on travel behavior. Moreover, ignoring activity participation as a mediating variable may also lead to insignificant effects of land use patterns.

The methodology used has several advantages: the estimation is jointly and not by pairs of variables, it identifies whether the causality is asymmetric (different effects from positive and negative returns), and, in the case of bidirectional relationships, it allows us to test whether the effect' is the same in both directions. This study provides evidence of causality in-mean and variance among the daily returns of stock markets indexes from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2014. The indexes are grouped by geographical areas to avoid problems of asynchrony with partially overlapping markets. The main results show that the causalities in-mean and in-variance are asymmetric with a different effect from positive and negative returns. Notably, by geographical areas, the Indian index SENSEX (symmetric) and the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange (asymmetric) are causatives in-mean for Asia, The Italian MIB 30 (asymmetric) is causative invariance for Europe, and the USA DOW JONES 100 (symmetric) and STANDARD&POORS 500 (asymmetric) indexes are causatives in-mean and in-variance for America. Also, the bidirectional relationships between the DOW JONES 100 and STANDARD&POORS 500 in-mean and in-variance have the same effect in both directions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The model is two-stage: (1) the leaders of each coalition control the size of the parties in their group so as to maximize the political power of their coalition, and (2) the political party leaders in each coalition decide their degree of participation in their coalition's collective action. The main conclusion is that the concentration in the two opposing coalitions will be related when the competition between them is fierce. This is shown to hold for the Left-wing and Right-wing coalitions in French local governments, revealing competition in fragmentation in these coalitions.","[Le Maux, Benoit; Rocaboy, Yvon] Univ Rennes 1, Condorcet Ctr Polit Econ, CREM, CNRS, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Le Maux, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Condorcet Ctr Polit Econ, CREM, CNRS, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",benoit.le-maux@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,26,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2016,167.0,1-2,,,,,67,94,,10.1007/s11127-016-0331-x,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DQ2GC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379019500005,0

This paper is based on the assumption that infrastructure drives economic accessibility and, therefore, we can assimilate a production function approach where the road network constitutes a set of inputs yielding access to markets as output. Methodologically, we originally measure the infrastructure inputs accounting for the real used network and calculate a series of new final and intermediate demand gravity-based and locational indicators, which capture a wide range of economic transactions and represent different concepts of economic accessibility outputs. The value added of this paper is translating a non-parametric frontier approach (DEA) to a dynamic scope (Malmquist indices) by connecting the regional accessibility to the productivity of the road infrastructure inputs associated with each region. Results during 1995-2005 show a low relative accessibility of the Spanish NUTS-3 regions, although improvements have been greater over the last five years. Finally, we observe a U-inverted relationship between the accessibility gains during these years and the geographical localization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a systematic overview of the problems and evaluates two prevailing solutions. We quantify the biases in a set of widely used empirical measures and show which estimates are most sensitive to missing linkages. The biases are found to be especially large in the size distribution of entrants and exits, in firm-level growth estimates for medium and large firms, and in job reallocation measures. We show that an employee-flow linkage method is more effective in reducing bias than a traditional link method often used by statistical agencies. A consistent approach is developed for imputing firm-level growth measures of linked firms.

Additionally, when sentiment is high (low), it results in lower (higher) fees. Our results highlight the use of investor sentiment approach in determining mutual fund fees and performance.

Tax progression generally tends to decrease the costs of business cycles because of lower wage and employment volatility. However, the volatility of public revenues stemming from labor income taxation also increases. If the government uses revenue measures to balance its budget, this increases consumption volatility of households with limited asset market participation. The opposite holds whenever public consumption is used to balance the budget. Overall, tax progression is welfare-enhancing for low to intermediate degrees of progressivity.","[Kremer, Jana; Staehler, Nikolai] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Kremer, J; Stähler, N (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",jana.kremer@bundesbank.de; nikolai.staehler@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,5,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2016,72.0,1,,,,,41,73,,10.1628/001522116X14557023949292,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DL1AY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375365500002,0

Moreover, equity issuers earn lower returns than debt issuers at subsequent earnings announcements.

Policymakers play an important role in the reclassification process because they establish test-based criteria that an EL must attain in order to become reclassified. If the criteria established by policymakers are incongruent with the instructional changes that result from reclassification, then services and settings may be denied to students who would otherwise benefit from them. In response to teachers' and administrators' concerns that some ELs who were reclassified were not succeeding without additional supports, California policymakers in 2006 to 2007 changed the reclassification criteria. In this paper, we examine the effects of changing these criteria using data on Latino/a students from the Los Angeles Unified School District, the U.S. district serving the largest number of ELs. Using difference-in-regression-discontinuities approaches, we find consistent evidence that this policy change, which increased the difficulty of attaining the test-based criteria for EL reclassification eligibility, had significant effects on high-school students' subsequent English language arts achievement (0.18 SDs) and graduation outcomes (11 percentage points). Specifically, when the criteria for reclassification were lower, students experienced negative effects of reclassification; but when the criteria were raised, students no longer experienced these negative effects. Highlighting the complex interplay between assessments, instruction, and policy, these findings demonstrate the important role policymakers play in the academic success of ELs and speak to policymaker considerations when implementing assessment and accountability systems.

A Composite Marginal Likelihood (CML) based ordered response probit (ORP) model, that simultaneously allows us to incorporate the influence of exogenous variables and potential correlations between boardings and alightings across multiple time periods of the day is employed. Our results indicate that headway affects ridership negatively, while the presence of public transportation around the stop has a positive and significant effect Moreover, parks, commercial enterprises, and residential area, amongst others, have various effects across the day on boardings and alightings at bus stops. An elasticity analysis provides useful insights. Specifically, we observe that the most effective way to increase ridership is to increase public transport service and accessibility, whereas enhancements to land use have a smaller effect on ridership. The framework from our analysis provides transit agencies a mechanism to study the influence of transit accessibility, transit connectivity, transit schedule alterations (to increase/reduce headway), and land-use pattern changes on ridership.

One conjecture is that if the redistribution mechanism is perceived as positive by the taxpayers, this leads them to comply with the tax laws more truthfully. In contrast, for a negative perception, lower tax compliance is expected. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically analyzing these effects. To fill this gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment and analyze how the redistribution of tax revenues influences tax compliance behavior by applying different reward mechanisms. In our experiment, subjects have to make two decisions. In the first stage, subjects decide on the contribution to a public good. In the second stage, subjects declare their income from the first stage for taxation. Our main results are threefold: First, from an aggregated perspective, rewards have a negative overall effect on tax compliance. Second, we observe that rewards affect the decision of taxpayers asymmetrically. In particular, rewards have either no effect (for those who are rewarded) or a negative effect (for those who are not rewarded) on tax compliance. Thus, if a high compliance rate of taxpayers is preferred, rewards should not be used by the tax authority. Third, we find an inverse u-shaped relationship between public good contribution and tax compliance. In particular, up to a certain level, tax compliance increases with subjects' own contributions to the public good. Above this level, however, tax compliance decreases with the public good contribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the macroeconomic repercussions of this change in policy, particularly for the distributions of income, wealth and consumption. Changes in taxes and transfers account for nearly half of the rise in wealth concentration. Nonetheless, their impact on the distributions of income and consumption has been minor due to changes in equilibrium prices and the offsetting effects of tax cuts and transfers on the dispersion of consumption. Results highlight the role of increasing wage dispersion during this period as the main driver of trends in inequality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The British Industrial Revolution initiate the era of a sustained economic growth all over the word and established institutions that have important effects even in the modern ages. This paper focuses on the determinants of labour productivity growth performance (in terms of the change in output per capita over time) of several OECD countries. In this conceptual framework several IPRs, such as trademarks and patents, are first analyzed in the context of knowledge intensive (business) service (hereafter KI(B)S) branches. In order to support both theoretical deductions and empirical findings of the literature a dynamic regression model is tested to clarify whether a valid relationship exists between output per capita and the number of patents and trademarks in the long run. The results of the regression analysis show that an increase in the number of trademarks and patents might correlate negatively with labour productivity growth in KI(B) S industries between 1995 and 2011. Hence, this conclusion also highlights that some institutional reforms are needed to change the current intellectual property right systems.","[Mate, Domician; Kun, Andras Istvan; Fenyves, Veronika] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Máté, D (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.",mate.domician@econ.unideb.hu,"Máté, Domicián/J-4640-2019; Fenyves, Veronika/HPC-1363-2023; Kun, András István/A-7646-2011","Máté, Domicián/0000-0002-4995-7650; Kun, András István/0000-0001-6175-551X",European Union; European Social Fund; National Excellence Program - Elaborating and operating an inland student and researcher personal support system [TAMOP 4.2.4.

Controlling for the endogeneity of household-level cyclone damage reveals that a household's exposure to the disaster increases its support for establishing marine protected areas, presumably for future safety nets. Evidence suggests that community members' social learning from disaster experience might facilitate their consensual decision making.","[Takasaki, Yoshito] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Takasaki, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.",takasaki@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Takasaki, Yoshito/0000-0002-4324-4668","Sumitomo Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan","Sumitomo Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The author wishes to thank the field team - Jonati Torocake, Viliame Manavure, Viliame Lomaloma and 16 enumerators - for their advice, enthusiasm and exceptional efforts on behalf of this project.

Foreign investors, at whom many of these measures are directed, have viewed the packages with a mix of cautious optimism and healthy scepticism. Investors have often heard Jokowi announce that Indonesia welcomes foreign capital, only to see these commitments countermanded by the actions of ministers and officials wanting more restrictive regulations and practices. It therefore remains uncertain whether these announcements and policy packages will lead to actual reform. One area in which the government is showing both intent and progress is infrastructure. Decades of under-investment and poor asset management have left Indonesia with a major infrastructure deficit, the economic and social costs of which are substantial. There are encouraging signs, however. Jokowi's administration is continuing its agenda of fiscal reform, shifting budget allocations away from energy subsidies and towards capital spending; investment approvals in infrastructure are rising fast; and the country's four largest construction firms have reported a large jump in the value of government-awarded contracts. Recent months have also seen the completion of the Makassar-Parepare segment of the Trans-Sulawesi railway and the first stage of the New Priok Port at Tanjung Priok, while the long-awaited Umbulan Springs project, which will supply water to Surabaya and surrounding areas, has been awarded to a preferred bidder. Demonstrating rapid progress in delivering infrastructure is clearly important to the Jokowi administration, but longer-term challenges remain. For one, Indonesia's inefficient planning and delivery model for national roads needs to be overhauled if the country is to safeguard its economic growth. The government has yet to fully tackle this and other long-term reforms; it has, however, recently introduced regulations that augur well for new flows of private investment, such as reinstating the role of such investment in the water sector and allowing for a more realistic risk allocation in public-private partnerships.","[Ray, David] Indonesia Infrastruct Initiat IndII, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Ing, Lili Yan] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Jakarta, Indonesia",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Ray, D (通讯作者)，Indonesia Infrastruct Initiat IndII, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,"Ray, David/0000-0002-4739-6773",,,,,21,26,27,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

While efficiency generally relates to how well an economy allocates scarce resources to meet the needs and wants of consumers. equity concerns the distribution of resources and is inevitably linked with concepts of fairness and social justice. The goal is to identify those circumstances under which equity and efficiency may not trade-off against each other. Economic, political and socio-cultural inequalities fuel differences in life chances, perpetuating them across generations. At least in theory, education is a means by which democracies attempt to equalize opportunities among citizens for economic success. Education and training policies could have a significant positive impact on economic and social outcomes, including sustainable development and social cohesion. It is commonly thought that opportunity equalization, in that dimension, is implemented by the provision of equal access to public resources to all citizens. however, very often this is not so and often existing public services - like education systems - reproduce or even compound existing inequities. Each society must decide the relative weight it ascribes to each of the principles of equity and to the efficient expansion of total production and socioeconomic development.","[Bejakovic, Predrag] Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Bejakovic, P (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb, Croatia.",predrag@ijf.hr,"Bejakovic, Predrag/AAY-6309-2020","Bejakovic, Predrag/0000-0002-4164-8220",,,,,12,0,0,1,3,NEWTON ACAD AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-09-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,34,44,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ3BI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000583794800003,0

We distinguish between frequent and infrequent acquirers and find that the first deal of frequent acquirers does not negatively affect the long-run performance of initial public offerings (IPOs); however, the second deal does. We also find that frequent acquirers experience significantly poorer performance in the five years following the IPO. The cumulative average abnormal returns for one through four years based on industry, size, and book-to-market ratio matching method are -20.07% for frequent acquirers as compared to -6.22% for infrequent acquirers. Further, we find that frequent acquirers are less likely to survive in the five years following the IPO than single acquirers are. We confirm that investors are overoptimistic about the decision to acquire within the first year of going public. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through an online survey administered using telephone assistance and sent to the 1,000 largest (in terms of revenue) foreign subsidiaries in Brazil. The responding companies numbered 167. For the data analysis, the authors chose the statistical technique of structural equation modeling. Findings - The paper shows that reverse innovation is related to headquarters' support, autonomy, and integration. Specifically, the authors consider the power of strategic integration between headquarters and subsidiaries as one of the important antecedents of reverse innovation. Practical implications - Integration has an important role to reverse innovation. In order to stimulate integration, the executive of a subsidiary can make such efforts as invest in the mechanism of the relationship and exchange knowledge with headquarters. For example, it is recommended to encourage travel to the headquarters to more accurately align perceptions of parent and subsidiary executives and to utilize expatriates from headquarters to provide knowledge to subsidiaries about the main processes of the company and to promote subsidiary innovations. Originality/value - Literature contains some articles discussing and relating some cases of reverse innovation. However, this paper shows the organizational structure necessary for reverse innovation.","[Borini, Felipe Mendes] ESPM, Int Business Dept, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Costa, Sidney; Oliveira Junior, Moacir de Miranda] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM); Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Costa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",sidneycosta@usp.br,"Borini, Felipe/ABE-1048-2020",,,,,,35,16,19,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Evidence from Sicily at the turn of the XXI century,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elections; Mafia-type organizations,INSTITUTIONS; ORIGINS,"This paper investigates the relationship between Sicilian mafia and politics by focusing on municipality-level results of national political elections. It exploits the fact that in the early 1990s the Italian party system collapsed, new parties emerged and mafia families had to look for new political allies. It presents evidence, based on disaggregated data from the Italian region of Sicily, that between 1994 and 2013 Silvio Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, obtained higher vote shares at national elections in municipalities plagued by mafia. The result is robust to the use of different measures of mafia presence, both contemporary and historical, to the inclusion of different sets of controls and to spatial analysis. Instrumenting mafia presence by determinants of its early diffusion in the late XIX century suggests that the correlation reflects a causal link. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Political theories, however, see liability insurance as serving the private interests of banks, bank borrowers, and depositors, potentially at the expense of the public interest. Empirical evidence-both historical and contemporary-supports the private-interest approach, as liability insurance has been associated with increases, rather than decreases, in systemic risk. Exceptions to this rule are rare and reflect design features that prevent moral hazard and adverse selection. Prudential regulation of insured banks has generally not been a very effective tool in limiting the systemic risk increases associated with liability insurance. This likely reflects purposeful failures in regulation; if liability insurance is motivated by private interests, then there would be little point to removing the subsidies it creates through strict regulation. The same logic explains why more effective policies for addressing systemic risk are not employed in place of liability insurance. The politics of liability insurance thus should not be narrowly construed to encompass only the vested interests of bankers. Indeed, in many countries, liability insurance has been installed as a pass-through subsidy targeted to particular classes of bank borrowers.","[Calomiris, Charles W.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Calomiris, Charles W.; Jaremski, Matthew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jaremski, Matthew] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Colgate University,"Calomiris, CW (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Calomiris, CW (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cc374@columbia.edu; mjaremski@colgate.edu,,,,,,,98,41,45,0,24,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4808-3,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

We find that perks are provided when the relative pay between top executives and average employees is low, in firms with high free cash flows, economic rent, and growth. Perks are positively associated with firm value, but to a much lesser extent than monetary compensation. This suggests that if perks are converted to cash compensation, shareholder wealth can be further enhanced. However, under China's regulated compensation structure, this conversion may not be easily achieved and perks likely represent a second-best suboptimal solution in motivating executives.","[Chen, Donghua] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Oliver Zhen] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Liang, Shangkun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; National University of Singapore; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, OZ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore.",bizzhenl@nus.edu.sg,"LIANG, Shangkun/GQP-4759-2022; Li, Oliver Zhen/B-5315-2016","Liang, Shangkun/0000-0001-5049-1686","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372032, 71402198]; Ministry of Education of Singapore [MOE 2012-T2-1-035]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [15JGC176]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Social Science Foundation of Beijing","Chen acknowledges a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71372032], [grant number 71402198]; Li acknowledges a Tier 2 grant (MOE 2012-T2-1-035) from the Ministry of Education of Singapore and Liang acknowledges a grant from the Social Science Foundation of Beijing [grant number 15JGC176].",,20,17,17,4,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The paper uses an extensive firm-level data set from several Asian countries during 2002-11, and tests the micro foundation of this theory by estimating the effect of an exogenous change in credit constraints, resulting from financial reforms, on firms' saving behavior. As predicted, after financial reforms, firms who were credit constrained previously decreased their savings more (or increased their savings less) relative to unconstrained firms. However, this firm-level effect did not lead to a decrease in aggregate corporate savings as conjectured by the theory. The sector-level regressions show that corporate savings increased after financial reforms, and more so for sectors more dependent on external finance. The current account surpluses also did not register a significant deterioration after financial reforms, consistent with the paper's findings on sectoral and aggregate corporate savings.","[Fan, Jingting; Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem] Univ Maryland, Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Ctr Econ Policy Res, College Pk, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Fan, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,29,6,10,0,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

At the beginning, it comprises a synthetic overview of the literature on entrepreneurial university and entrepreneurial education accompanied by an analysis of data offered by the most recent and relevant studies on youth entrepreneurship conducted in Romania and in other European countries. A survey conducted by the authors of this paper on students from three Romanian universities (N=945) shows that the majority of respondents, especially students that study in the field of economics, are interested in having their own business after graduation. Materialistic students are more interested in entrepreneurship, thus one of the possible explanations for this high level of interest in entrepreneurship is the belief that having a business would bring more money and consequently more happiness. Nevertheless, this study shows that socio-demographical variables are not significant predictors of the interest in entrepreneurship. The paper will conclude with a series of concrete recommendations addressed to the Romanian universities, to encourage and to develop entrepreneurial skills among students.","[Frunzaru, Valeriu; Leovaridis, Cristina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Frunzaru, V (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",valeriu.frunzaru@comunicare.ro; cristina.leovaridis@comunicare.ro,"Leovaridis, Cristina/GLT-6966-2022",,,,,,25,1,1,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,612,620,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300050,0

Minimal opportunities in the formal sector leave migrants in particular engaging in informal and illegal activities that offer poor livelihood security. In this paper we examine these activities in northern Zambia's emerald mines to highlight some of the issues and barriers to sustainable development that exist across mining zones. We conclude that livelihood choices are not augmented by a so-called sustainable mining' approach that fails to engage all sectors of the population. We show the numerous challenges faced by migrants in this part of Zambia to accentuate the factors that need to be addressed before favourable environments for fostering sustainable mining might be achieved.","[Gilberthorpe, Emma; Agol, Dorice] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR2 4BU, Norfolk, England; [Gegg, Thomas] IDL Grp, Bristol, Avon, England",University of East Anglia,"Gilberthorpe, E (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR2 4BU, Norfolk, England.",e.gilberthorpe@uea.ac.uk,,,World Land Trust; Gemfields Mining PLC; Gemfields,World Land Trust; Gemfields Mining PLC; Gemfields,This research was conducted with financial support from The World Land Trust in partnership with Gemfields Mining PLC.

Since experimental conditions can be easily controlled and manipulated in the lab, high internal validity can be achieved. The external validity of lab experiments, however, is often poor due to the highly stylized environment. Hence, in recent years, researchers have increasingly left the lab and used the Internet to run economic experiments. In this paper, we aim to systematize economic experiments and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of online approaches. In particular, we focus on the question of how experiments can be used for policy analysis in the agricultural sector. Our core findings are as follows: first, the costs of online experiments are considerably lower than those of traditional lab experiments. This applies to the direct costs of experimenters as well as to the opportunity costs of experimental subjects. Second, experimenters, who always struggle with limited budgets, can exploit the cost advantage of online approaches and take various measures to increase external validity. Spare funds can be used to recruit more participants and/or to grant higher performance-related payoffs. In conjunction with participants' reduced opportunity costs, they will also make it easier to recruit representatives of the social group of interest (e.g., farmers), instead of using convenience groups of students as surrogate experimental subjects. A high-numbered experimental testing of the real behavior of real decision makers who face relevant real payoffs has a good chance to increase the quality of conditional behavioral forecasting. This, in turn, is the prerequisite of reliable policy analysis. Third, decisions in online experiments are made in the familiar setting of people's home offices. The situational context is thus much more similar to decision making in regular life than a lab setting. While being beneficial for external validity, using the home setting also entails a disadvantage. It reduces internal validity because the extra-laboratory decision environment cannot be well controlled. Experimenters cannot observe, for example, which sources of information, tools, time, and effort participants use to arrive at experimental decisions.","[Gruener, Sven; Hirschauer, Norbert] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Gottingen,"Grüner, S (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Ernahrungswissensch, Karl Freiherr von Fritsch Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",sven.gruener@landw.uni-halle.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Gruener, Sven/0000-0001-5794-7076; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",ScienceCampus Halle (WCH); German Research Foundation (DFG),ScienceCampus Halle (WCH); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments, ideas, and criticism.

If one country imposes capital controls unilaterally, it can generate favorable changes in the dynamics of equilibrium interest rates and the terms of trade, and thereby benefit at the expense of its trading partner. If both countries simultaneously impose capital controls, the welfare effects are ambiguous. The paper identifies calibrations in which symmetric capital controls improve terms-of-trade insurance against country-specific shocks and thereby increase welfare for both countries.","[Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.",,,,,,,,29,18,26,1,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Many emerging markets find themselves destabilized by these fluctuations, not only when price increases lead to currency appreciations and reduced competitiveness, but also when price decreases cause capital outflows and deteriorations in the balance of payments. This study examines the volatility processes of six major commodity prices, before applying Multivariate GARCH analysis to examine spillovers among important commodity prices and output, exchange rates, interest rates and inflation in major emerging markets. While each commodity and each country behaves differently, we find that Chile is most closely tied to the copper price, and Indonesia to oil and tin, while neighbors such as Brazil and the Philippines are less affected. Perhaps surprisingly, Russia is found to be highly insulated from fluctuations in world oil prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the widely held view that budgetary constraints caused by economic crises reduce aid is inaccurate because donor government outlays actually tend to increase. We develop an argument that aid cuts occur because voters place a lower priority on aid during economic downturns and politicians respond by cutting aid. Using data from Eurobarometer, we demonstrate that economic downturns lead to reduced public support for helping the poor abroad. These findings are robust across a large number of alternative specifications. Our findings have implications for how advocates may prevent aid reductions during economic recessions.

Drawing on a systematic review of over 90 social accountability interventions, including some involving social protection, this paper shows that politics and context are critical to shaping their success. We argue that the politics of social protection and of social accountability resonate strongly with the broader project of transforming state-society relations in developing countries. This requires a reconceptualisation of social accountability and social protection in terms of the broader development of social contracts', and that the current emphasis on promoting bottom-up forms of accountability needs to be balanced by efforts to strengthen and legitimise public authority in developing countries.","[Hickey, Sam; King, Sophie] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Hickey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",sam.hickey@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,45,52,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Estimation of the Samuelson effect is by the ordinary least squares (OLS) approach using the volatility estimator in Garman and Klass (1980), Parkinson (1980) and Serletis (1992). The analysis simultaneously tests for the Samuelson effect, while establishing significance of traded volume, change in open interest and bid-ask spread on intraday volatility. Multicollinearity and seasonality are incorporated to examine if maturity effects remain in the contracts. Findings are that only wheat supports maturity effects.

In this paper, the author therefore theoretically and empirically addresses issues of classroom management in conditions of the lower secondary level of education in primary schools in the Slovak Republic. According to the fact that there is not given sufficient attention to issues of classroom management within the undergraduate teacher training, candidates are insufficiently prepared for the performance of class teacher roles, they do not have adequate opportunity to become familiar with workload before they start to teach. In this context, the paper will focus on the analysis of classroom management, with an emphasis on competencies and skills of the class teacher, which are essential for its successful implementation. The aim of the research is to analyze the competencies and skills of the class teacher, which he/she should dispose of in order to manage effectively a class. The research was carried out at the lower secondary level of education (ISCED 2) in primary schools in selected regions of Slovakia. The research sample consisted of class teachers at that level of education. In order to evaluate our findings, we applied a quantitative research method. As a tool for collecting research data, we used a specially designed questionnaire, containing 26 items. Based on the data allowance author analyzes and evaluates information in relation to the competencies that should class teachers dispose in order to the effective implementation of classroom management. Based on the research findings, the author formulates recommendations in relation to the management of schools and proposes solutions for improving the work of classroom teachers themselves.

Second, trading information, such as bid-ask spread, trading volume, and the price volatility from cross-markets, improves the price volatility predictability for both in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.

Useful information produced by accounting contributes to mitigating the information asymmetry within economy. The theoretical classification of accounting functions is also relevant for the standard-setting, as different decision tasks require different sets of accounting information. Standard-setters face then a challenge, which function shall have priority over others. Setters utilise the findings of accounting research, which offers relevant inputs for the cost-benefit analysis of deliberated accounting treatments.

In the Finnish open-list proportional representation system, voters rank the candidates within parties, and thus, concentrating votes to local candidates increases the extent of local representation. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the vote distributions become more concentrated in municipalities less likely to gain local representation after the mergers. Moreover, the effect is much larger in municipalities where the benefits of local representation to voters are large. The latter result disentangles voters' responses from the responses of other political actors. The results are important also for designing local government mergers, which are an important policy tool in many countries. They highlight that concerns over deteriorating local democracy due to mergers have merit, because voters have preferences for local representation. At the same time, the vote concentration patterns we find alleviate these concerns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Farmers' production decisions regarding maize and their response to policy incentives are critical for national food security and regional trade. The aim of the study was to estimate the supply response of the South African maize sector to price and non-price incentives. A Nerlovian partial adjustment model was applied to historical time series data of area under maize cultivation, measured in hectares spanning from 1980-2012 to determine the supply response. Results indicate a short-run price elasticity of 0.24 and a long-run price elasticity of 0.36, signifying that maize farmers are less sensitive to price changes than non-price incentives. The results confirm that non-price incentives such as rainfall and technology seem to have more effect on maize supply than price incentives in South Africa.

About 63% percent of the total variation in the investor sentiment index can be explained by well-known, contemporaneous risk/business cycle variables. We decompose the widely used investor sentiment index into two components: one related to standard risk/business cycle variables and the other unrelated to those variables.

One of the main problems was the crisis that began in the time of the adoption of the euro by Slovakia. In this situation, potential tourists much more precisely watched price-quality relationship. Introduction of the euro allowed to conduct international comparisons. The author argues that the apparent increase in prices resulting from the introduction of the euro was not the reason for the decline in demand for tourist services.

IC is sometimes known as intangible or knowledge assets as opposed to the much more familiar traditional physical capital and financial capital, which are tangible in nature. Many researchers found that IC would create the majority of corporate values, especially for knowledge-intensive companies, explaining why IC has become the single most important driver of enterprise business growth, sustainability, innovation and competitive advantage in our globalized environment. Therefore proper assessment and reporting of these critical though intangible assets are essential in addition to what financial reports received by the business community for years. As there is currently much literature written on IC performance in the field already, this paper focuses instead on the risks such as knowledge loss from poor documentation or resignation of key staff. In particular, how a knowledge of IC risks can enhance the quality of credit risk analysis of financial institutions is also studied, as a poor credit risk management may quickly erode the capital base and accumulated earnings of any bank. In this research, an exploratory test design comprising a literature review and semi-structured interviews with credit risk banking professionals have been developed and adopted. Information is collected on IC risks in general and how and why IC risks can be useful in credit risk analysis of business loan applicants. A conceptual framework is then put forward to identify, analyze and assess the potential IC risks and their impacts, which are important considerations in the value creation process of an enterprise. The relevance of the framework to credit risks analysis is also addressed.","[Tsang, Haley Wing Chi; Lee, Rongbin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, KMIRC, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Tsang, HWC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, KMIRC, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",haley.wc.tsang@connect.polyu.hk; wb.lee@polyu.edu.hk,"Tsang, Haley Wing Chi/N-2497-2015","Tsang, Haley Wing Chi/0000-0001-5477-3250",Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University [RU8Q],Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,The authors would like to thank the Research Committee and the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for the financial support of the research study (Account Code: RU8Q).,,24,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,418,425,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300050,0

Using the CBOE VIX and its innovation on the concurrent spot volatility as proxies for expected volatility, we present evidence of an increase in S&P 500 index futures mispricing with expected volatility. The impact of the VIX grows exponentially across the distribution of conditional mispricing levels, which suggests that the expectations of heightened future volatility become increasingly detrimental to arbitrage activities when the futures price deviations are enlarged; however, the influence of expected volatility is found to have been reduced during the global financial crisis period, a period during which concurrent volatility overwhelmingly dominated the magnitude of mispricing.

J,"Yavas, BF; Rezayat, F",,,,"Yavas, Burhan F.; Rezayat, Fahimeh",,,"Country ETF returns and volatility spillovers in emerging stock markets, Europe and USA",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emerging markets; Portfolio diversification; GARCH and MARMA; Return and volatility spillovers,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linkages among equity exchange traded funds (ETF) returns and transmission of volatilities of the USA, Europe and key emerging countries' stock markets. Standard & Poor's 500 (spy) and iShares Europe are used to represent the USA and European stock markets, the emerging market part of the data set consists of daily returns of equity ETF representing broad equity market indices of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China); the mist countries (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey) and South Africa and covers the period of February 3, 2012-February 28, 2014. Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilizes multi-variate auto-regressive moving-averages (MARMA) methodology to study equity market returns and spillovers. Second, generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskadasticity (GARCH) modeling is employed to model volatility persistence and transmissions. Findings - The findings include the existence of significant co-movement of returns among all country ETFs; however, despite increasing interdependencies among the global stock markets there are still very good opportunities for diversification. For example, USA and Europe based investors may do well to ignore opportunities in each other's markets but can realize diversification benefits by investing in ETFs representing China, South Africa and Turkey. As far as volatilities are concerned, the findings indicate that no ETF volatility is transmitted from the sample countries to USA, Brazil, China and South African stock markets. Also, US market volatility is transmitted to India, Russia, Mexico and Turkey while European volatility spills over to Mexico and South Korea. The presence of spillovers among stock markets' return series and persistence of volatilities are useful to investors interested in diversifying their portfolios and to traders/fund managers who are interested in maximizing returns. Research limitations/implications - The implications include: first, investors should not only rely on current domestic news to guide their investment decisions, but also take into consideration international news for there are substantial spillovers. Second, given that volatilities can proxy for risk, there are lessons for both individual and institutional investors in terms of further examining pricing securities, hedging and other trading strategies as well as framing regulatory policies. Third, investors should be able to ride the financial cycle by following closely monetary policies of the FED and European Central Bank and resulting credit expansion or contraction since research indicates (and as corroborated in this study) equity prices are linked to VIX which is also correlated with capital flows and credit expansion and interest rates. Limitations include: first, the investigation could be expanded to include individual countries in Europe instead of using one Europe-wide ETF. As ETFs for other emerging markets become available it is also possible to include additional countries. Second, ETFs may not be the best vehicles for diversification. Originality/value - Methodology (MARMA and GARCH) is widely used for analyzing financial data. The use of BRIC and MIST countries and the interaction among them may be novel. Spillovers among emerging financial markets is a fairly new area. Typically, the authors see studies of spillovers from the developed countries to the developing ones. The data period is important since it covers both credit expansion and contraction (or the start of it) by the FED and is current.","[Yavas, Burhan F.] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Carson, CA 90747 USA; [Rezayat, Fahimeh] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Carson, CA 90747 USA",California State University System; California State University Dominguez Hills; California State University System; California State University Dominguez Hills,"Yavas, BF (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",byavas@csudh.edu,"Yavas, Burhan F/B-6528-2018",,,,,,44,19,19,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Accounting for unobserved community-level heterogeneity with random effects and correlated random effects models, we link facility-based birth delivery to the period of decentralisation and Indonesia's major island groups using a pooled sample of 71,815 children. We also generate direct estimates of neonatal mortality from 1990 to 2007. The results show that the implementation of decentralisation has accorded with a marked expansion in both health service and outcome inequalities in Indonesia, at least with respect to neonates. Systemic funding failures for health and decision-space issues resulting from decentralisation are likely to have greater impact in disadvantaged regions where local capacity is weakest. The need to address these fundamental issues to reduce inequalities and improve general health outcomes appears supportable.","[Hodge, Andrew; Firth, Sonja; Jimenez-Soto, Eliana] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Trisnantoro, Laksono] Gadjah Mada Univ, Ctr Hlth Serv Management, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",University of Queensland; Gadjah Mada University,"Hodge, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, MDG 4 & 5,Publ Hlth Bldg,Herston Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia.",a.hodge@uq.edu.au,"Hodge, Andrew/C-4779-2014",,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [52125]; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [47734],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government),"This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [52125]; and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [47734].

The estimates based on a dynamic probit model reveal that violations of UIP, RPPP and equity market pseudo-parity exhibit predictive power for currency cycles albeit only at short horizons.

We examine the sensitivity of international bank flows to debtor countries' sovereign credit rating changes before and after the implementation of the Basel 2 risk-based capital regulatory rules. We study the quarterly bilateral flows from G-10 creditor banking systems to 77 recipient countries over the period Q4:1999 to Q2:2013. We find direct evidence that sovereign credit re-ratings that lead to changes in risk-weights for capital adequacy requirements have become more significant since the implementation of Basel 2 rules for assessing banks' credit risk under the standardized approach. This evidence is consistent with global banks acting via their international lending decisions to minimize required capital charges associated with the use of ratings-contingent regulation. We find no evidence to suggest that banking regulation induced foreign lending has heightened the perceived sovereign credit risks of recipient countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The current Irish system of financing GP care is unusual internationally, with the requirement for a large proportion of the population to pay the full cost of GP care a particular concern. Previous research on the impact of the Irish system of public healthcare eligibility on utilisation has largely concentrated on the total adult population and there has been little research on the older population. This is despite the fact that the older population are heavy users of healthcare and that different factors may be more important in determining healthcare utilisation among the older population. Using nationally representative data on a large sample of individuals aged 50+ from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), this paper examines the determinants of GP utilisation, with a particular focus on the impact of the Irish system of public healthcare eligibility. One of the main advantages of TILDA over existing national and international datasets is the availability of objective information on the health of respondents, collected via nurse-led health assessments. The results indicate that eligibility for free public healthcare is associated with a significantly higher number of GP visits, even after controlling for a wide variety of both subjective and objective indicators of health need. However, we find no evidence for a significant income gradient in GP visiting among the older Irish population without full eligibility for free GP care. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To date, most policies and projects have promoted mitigation and adaptation separately, and they-have very rarely considered integrating these two objectives. In this article, we develop a multi-dimensional framework to explore the extent to which climate mitigation forestry projects bring adaptation concerns into their design and implementation phases, using three Belizean projects as case-study material. We demonstrate that linking mitigation and adaptation has not been possible, because the mandate of forest carbon markets does not incorporate adaptation concerns. The projects' contribution to forest ecosystems' adaptation, for instance, by reducing human encroachments and by increasing ecosystem connectivity, has been limited. The projects' contribution to improve local livelihoods has also been limited, and projects have even been contested by neighboring communities on the grounds of tenure conflicts and food security concerns. Furthermore, the projects' mitigation potential is constrained by their poor additionality and lack of rigorous enforcement. We then conclude that the integration of mitigation and adaptation in Belize's carbon forestry projects remains a laudable but elusive goal. Consequently, we request climate change donors to refrain from providing support to narrowly designed projects and we urge them instead to promote more holistic and territorial-based approaches targeting both mitigation and adaptation goals.

In its standard variant, individuals who play the game of politics should also be considered rational and self-interested, unlike the benevolent despot of traditional welfare economics. History repeats itself with the rise of behavioral economics: Assuming cognitive biases to be present in the market, but not in politics, behavioral economists often call for government to intervene in a benevolent way. Recently, however, political economists have started to apply behavioral economics insights to the study of political processes, thereby re-establishing a unified methodology.

We use the relationship between education and two routes to early retirement - the receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and the early claiming of Social Security retirement benefits - to illustrate the long- lasting influence of education. We find that for both men and women with less than a high school degree the median DI participation rate is 6.6 times the participation rate for those with a college degree or more. Similarly, men and women with less than a high school education are over 25 percentage points more likely to claim Social Security benefits early than those with a college degree or more. We focus on four critical ''pathways through which education may indirectly influence early retirement - health, employment, earnings, and the accumulation of assets. We find that for women health is the dominant pathway through which education influences DI participation. For men, the health, earnings, and wealth pathways are of roughly equal magnitude. For both men and women the principal channel through which education influences early Social Security claiming decisions is the earnings pathway. We also consider the direct effect of education that does not operate through these pathways. The direct effect of education is much greater for early claiming of Social Security benefits than for DI participation, accounting for 72% of the effect of education for men and 67% for women. For women the direct effect of education on DI participation is not statistically significant, suggesting that the total effect may be through the four pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, little open and standardized data exist on these systems. The Digital Matatus project in Nairobi, Kenya set out to test whether the geo-locative capabilities of mobile technology could be used to collect data on a semi-formal transit system and whether that data could be translated into the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data standard for wider use. The results of this work show that mobile technologies, particularly mobile phones, which are increasingly prevalent in developing countries, can indeed be used effectively to collect and deliver data in a modified GTFS format for semi-formal transit. Perhaps more importantly, through our work in Nairobi, we were able to identify the benefits and technical needs for developing data on semi-formal transit. Overall, the work illustrates (1) how the GTFS can be adapted to semi-formal systems and used by other cities with such transit systems, (2) that there is demand from technologists as well as transport communities for comprehensive data on semi-formal transit, (3) that releasing the data openly in the GTFS standard format can help to encourage the development of transportation applications, and (4) that including the entire transit community during the data development can create a community of users and mechanisms for institutionalizing a process of data updating and sharing. The engagement strategies our research team developed around the data collection process in Nairobi became just as important as the resulting data it produced. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The empirical model is based on the pioneer work by Ho and Saunders (1981) and some of its extensions in the literature. The sample consists of a balanced panel, composed of 64 banks in the period between the first quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2012. The results of the static model suggest that administrative expenses, revenue from services and coverage index are important determinants of the ex-post spread. The macroeconomic environment showed positive effects arising from real GDP while the Herfindahl-Hirschaman index indicated that spreads are higher for a more concentrated banking system. The dynamic model revealed a moderate persistence of the ex-post banking spread and a relevant role for the banks' market-share. The overall pure spread indicates that banks consider the Brazilian economy a risky environment to operate.

Second, the effect of stock liquidity on earnings management is amplified for firms with high levels of managerial pay-for-performance sensitivity. Third, the positive association between the intensity of earnings management and firm cost of capital is evident only for firms with low stock liquidity. Our findings are consistent with the threat of blockholder exit as the main governance channel through which stock liquidity discourages opportunistic earnings management and mitigates managerial short-termism.

By analysing the link between economic conditions and the survival of small co-operative banks, this study sheds light on the importance of the economic environment after assessing individual bank stability over time. The results show that bank failure is better captured when we account for the state of the economy both at the national and the regional level. Moreover, voluntary closures and acquisitions across provinces appear to be related with bank distress. Our findings have important policy implications. First, using a wider spectrum of information increases the accuracy of default prediction models, improving the supervisory toolbox used to monitor the health of small banks. Second, economic downturns increase a co-operative bank's default risk, supporting the introduction of countercyclical capital buffers to lessen the negative effects associated to bank instability.

Performed on a sample of 276 entrepreneurs, via a questionnaire, the main objectives of the research were to estimate the influence exerted by the main characteristics of business environment on the foundation of a company and to identify the characteristics of entrepreneurs in order to develop an entrepreneur profile. Due to the defining importance of entrepreneurial education, the research was focused on the identification and assessment of the skills that the investigated entrepreneurs possessed.

In particular, we underscore the importance of both choice of forecast or simulation horizon and choice between minimizing point or distribution based loss measures. Our empirical analysis centers around the implementation of a series of simulation and prediction experiments, as well as a discussion of the stochastic properties of seasonal unit root models. Our prediction experiments are based on an analysis of a group of 14 variables which have been chosen to closely mimic the set of indicators used by the Federal Reserve to help in setting U.S. monetary policy, and our simulation experiments are based on a comparison of simulated and historical distributions of said variables using the testing approach of Corradi and Swanson (2007a). A key impetus for this paper stems from the fact that various financial service companies routinely create economic scenarios, whereby seasonal and nonstationary financial and economic variables such as those examined here are simulated (and predicted) using relatively simple time series models. These economic scenarios are subsequently used in risk management and asset allocation, as is often mandated by various world financial regulatory authorities. Our findings suggest that a simple version of the seasonal unit root (SUROOT) model performs very well in predicting 8 of 14 variables, when the forecast horizon is 1-step ahead. However, for horizons greater than one-step ahead, our SUROOT model performs poorly when used for prediction, suggesting that parameter estimation error is crucial to understanding the empirical performance of such models. This parameter estimation error result is confirmed via a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Simulation experiments yield similar conclusions, although SUROOT models in this case are useful for constructing forward conditional distributions at 1- and 3-step ahead horizons. Interestingly, simple periodic autoregressions do not have this property, and are found to perform very well in both prediction and simulation experiments, at all horizons up to 60 months ahead.

Our analysis is based on the strategic interaction in cost-reducing investment decisions between domestic firms and a foreign firm, which is different from the common factors that are discussed in the literature such as spillovers and technology sourcing. Our results are as follows. We show that domestic R&D investment may either increase or decrease the foreign firm's FDI incentives. Further, depending on the marginal cost of domestic firms, domestic R&D incentives can always increase regardless of the effects of domestic R&D investment on the foreign firm's FDI decision. Finally, we find that domestic welfare improves under domestic cost reduction if the slope of the marginal cost of domestic R&D investment is sufficiently small.","[Yang, Yibai] Univ Nottingham, GEP, IAPS, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yibai] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Yang, YB (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, GEP, IAPS, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yibai.yang@hotmail.com,"Yang, Yibai/ABG-4101-2021","Yang, Yibai/0000-0001-7595-2215",,,,,26,4,4,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It is against such benchmarks that managers should be judged. With this principle foremost in our approach, we use style-consistent benchmarks to determine whether any observed alpha produced by a sample of U.S. equity funds is due to skill or to luck. We find that different segments of the market, ranging from large-cap growth to small-cap value, exhibit different levels of skill and luck. Our results also show that the use of standard multi-factor models underestimates managerial ability and overstates the proportion of funds whose abnormal performance can be attributed to chance rather than to skill, when compared against the use of style-consistent practitioner benchmarks. We also find that a single factor performance evaluation model that uses Russell Style indices consistent with the style orientation of a fund and market practice provides a parsimonious way of accounting for fund performance. Finally, our findings should be of particular relevance in mutual fund markets where the risk factors commonly used in the academic literature to evaluate manager performance - SMB, B/M, MOM and others - are not readily available.

In contrast, the decomposition of the equity risk premium into a diffusion component and a jump risk component and the compartment of the latter into its various elements has a huge impact on the utility in a complete market.

Using the 2011 data from the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area, this study examines the influences of neighborhood type, travel attitudes, and their interaction terms on commute mode choice. The interactions between neighborhood type and travel attitudes have no significant impact on driving commute frequency whereas the effects of neighborhood type on the propensity for transit commute differ by transit preference. Specifically, urban consonants (including those in LRT neighborhoods) have the highest propensity for transit commute, followed by suburban dissonants, urban dissonants, and then suburban consonants. Therefore, individuals' heterogeneous responses to built environment elements should be taken into account in future research and in the design of land use and transportation policies aiming to shape urban travel.

This paper contributes to this literature by identifying happiness as another key driver of the same decision. Using detailed survey data from a sample of Dutch households, we show that the impact of happiness on households' financial decisions works in the opposite direction and is more economically important compared to trust. Specifically, happiness leads to a lower probability of investing into risky financial assets and having insurance, while trust has the usual positive effect found in the literature. Furthermore, the negative effect of happiness on the ownership of risky financial assets is about 6% higher compared to the positive equivalent of trust. Similarly, the negative effect of happiness on the ownership of insurance is 3% higher than the positive effect of trust. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We address this issue in two studies measuring individual risk preferences and prospect theory parameters (i.e., utility curvature, probability weighting, and loss aversion) for both time and money. In the first (resp., second) study we consider relatively small (resp., large) time and monetary outcomes. We find that individuals hold similar risk preferences for time and money; we also find evidence that time is money with regard to the utility curvature for gains, loss aversion, and decision weighting. However, individuals have different valuations of losing time and money. The utility function for small losses of money is more concave and variable than the utility function for small losses of time (Study 1), but the utility function for large losses of time is more concave and variable than that for large losses of money (Study 2).

We first survey transit circuity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, region in detail, comparing auto and transit trips. This paper finds that circuity can help to explain mode choices of commuters. We then investigate thirty-five additional metropolitan areas in the United States. The results from these areas show that transit circuity exponentially declines as travel time increases. Moreover, we find that the circuity of transit networks is higher than that of road networks, illustrating how transit systems choose to expand their spatial coverage at the expense of directness and efficiency in public transportation networks. This paper performs a regression analysis that suggests the circuity of transportation networks can estimate transit accessibility, which helps to explain mode share. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The principal hypothesis is that a positive age-based self-image enhances the likelihood of individuals turning their intention to start a business into actual behaviour. The empirical analysis based on data collected on the general adult population of Finland in 2011 and 2012 (n = 672) supports this hypothesis. The analysis further shows that this positive effect is independent of the individual's chronological age, and it is thus applicable to both age groups that are under-represented in entrepreneurship: 'youngsters' and 'seniors'. Promoting the development of a positive age-based self-image is a prospective policy option for fostering entrepreneurship among younger and older age groups. More in-depth research, especially concerning the antecedents of positive age-based self-image, is required for the effectiveness of such policy interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We identify legal and financial impediments that may prevent the use of a SPOE strategy for this purpose. Dodd-Frank does not authorize bank recapitalizations through SPOE or otherwise, and the OLA cannot be invoked unless the failure of a subsidiary puts the parent in danger of default. The imprecise legislative language that authorizes OLA creates a new source of systemic risk. Regulations required to operationalize SPOE will require bank holding companies to issue a substantial volume of new subordinated debt, increasing these institutions' leverage and financial fragility.

For one particular probabilistic model describing the preferences of the electorate, the so-called impartial culture (IC) model used by Banzhaf, the Penrose formula shows that the two objectives coincide. The IC probabilistic model assumes that voter preferences are independent and neutral. In this article, we prove a general version of the Penrose formula, allowing for preference correlations and biases in the electorate. We use that formula to illustrate, for a spectrum of well-known probabilistic models, how the divergence between the two social objectives impacts the ranking and performances of the voting mechanisms.","[Le Breton, Michel] Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Le Breton, Michel] Inst Univ France, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Van der Straeten, Karine] CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Van der Straeten, Karine] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Van der Straeten, K (通讯作者)，CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, 2 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",karine.van-der-straeten@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2015,165.0,1-2,,,,,103,122,,10.1007/s11127-015-0296-1,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CX0ZR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365426500008,0

Using data drawn from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1979 to 2012, I find no evidence that minimum wage increases were associated with changes in overall state GDP. However, this null finding masks substantial heterogeneity in the productivity effects of minimum wages across industries and over the business cycle. Difference-in-difference-in-difference estimates suggest that a 10% increase in the minimum wage is associated with a short-run 1% to 2% decline in state GDP generated by lower-skilled industries relative to more highly skilled industries. This differential appears larger during troughs as compared to that during peaks of the state business cycle.

Both debates are examining two sides of the same phenomenon - the growing role of private financial investors in the global agri-food value chains and the myriad consequences of it. The symposium moves beyond the identification of finance as an exogenous factor to the trends in the sector. It examines real-life incarnations of finance in the sector by looking at investment arrangements, including connections with the state, and its (regional) variations. The symposium addresses three main themes. First, it explores the interplay of the state and private finance. It shows that the effect of regulation is limited in the face of increasingly mobile and complex investment flows. Second, it addresses the shifts and transfigurations of risk in the agri-food sector due to financialization. Third, the symposium discusses to what extent, and how, the origins and identity of farmland investors still matters within an increasingly globalized financial sector. The paper concludes by identifying some related areas for further research.","[Visser, Oane] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Clapp, Jennifer] Univ Waterloo, Global Food Secur & Sustainabil, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Isakson, S.

Theoretical justifications of a negative relationship between economic development and inequality indeed suggest that it is not the inequality of economic outcomes, income or consumption, per se that hinders economic development but other dimensions of economic and social inequality, including family background, access to the credit market, education, health care, security, justice and so-called horizontal inequality between ethnic groups or gender. It turns out that the inequality of income, on which the empirical literature focuses almost exclusively, is a very imperfect marker of this broader definition of inequality, that corresponds to the inequality of opportunity. At the same time, and somewhat paradoxically, correcting these various dimensions of inequality requires policies that imply some redistribution of income, even though income inequality is more a consequence than the main cause of those inequalities that actually hinder development.","[Bourguignon, Francois] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Bourguignon, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",francois.bourguignon@psemail.eu,,,,,,,59,11,12,1,15,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

States have attempted to reclaim the sales tax base but are constrained by current nexus rules that allow firms to choose whether to establish taxability based on a decision to establish physical presence. We examine how state tax policies affect the propensity of firms to establish nexus in each state. We find that firms are more likely to have nexus in large states, and that the effect of policy on nexus decisions appears to be relatively immediate and a function of current sales tax rates and base breadth.

The empirical analysis focuses on the performance of German federal tax revenue forecasts, in the preparation of which the advice of external experts has a long tradition as an institutional safeguard. While, on average, revenue forecasts turn out to be unbiased, the results show that the government exerts an influence. In particular, optimism/pessimism in the government's GDP forecast helps to explain why the revenue forecast turns out too optimistic/pessimistic. In addition, governmental estimates of the revenue effects of tax-law changes are found to contribute to forecast errors.","[Buettner, Thiess] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Kauder, Bjoern] Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Ifo Institut,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",thiess.buettner@fau.de; kauder@ifo.de,,"Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",,,,,35,10,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,287,307,,10.1007/s11127-015-0279-2,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500007,0

MIND/FIND surveillance allows countries to screen people and documents systematically at border crossings against INTERPOL databases on terrorists, fugitives, and stolen and lost travel documents. Such documents have been used in the past by terrorists to transit borders. By applying methods developed in the treatment-effects literature, this paper establishes that countries adopting MIND/FIND experienced fewer transnational terrorist attacks than they would have had they not adopted MIND/FIND. Our estimates indicate that, on average, from 2008 to 2011, adopting and using MIND/FIND results in 0.5 fewer transnational terrorist incidents each year per 100 million people. Thus, a country like France with a population just above 64 million people in 2008 would have 0.32 fewer transnational terrorist incidents per year owing to its use of INTERPOL surveillance. This amounts to a sizeable average proportional reduction of about 30 percent. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Adding the UPMIFA-mandated 7% payout constraint, the endowment size and asset allocations match those empirically observed. This constraint has little effect on universities that do not value the output of their internal projects but harms those that do: it prevents the endowment's use as an effective buffer stock, thereby increasing the volatility of production, and it slows the growth of the most productive universities.","[Gilbert, Thomas; Hrdlicka, Christopher] Univ Washington, Michael G Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gilbert, T (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Michael G Foster Sch Business, PACCAR Hall,Box 353226, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",gilbertt@u.washington.edu,"Gilbert, Thomas/JSK-2650-2023; Hrdlicka, Christopher/Q-6748-2019; Gilbert, Thomas/E-5187-2013","Gilbert, Thomas/0000-0002-0201-8648",,,,,55,17,22,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Some authors presume that agencies seek to maximize program objectives; others suggest agencies favor the districts important to the president's election. In addition, agencies may distribute larger program resources to those districts whose congressional representatives are best positioned to help the agency. We examined how federal government agencies responded both to the 2006 election, when control of Congress shifted from the Republican to the Democratic Party, and to the 2010 election, when the House switched from Democratic to Republican control. We used a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate the impact of each election on the agencies' allocations of contracts. Agencies generally responded to the elections by allocating more contract resources to districts represented by the winning party. However, federal agencies reacted differently to changing political environments, depending on the characteristics of the agency. For example, after the 2006 election, those agencies with programs favored by Republican members of Congress allocated more resources to Democratic districts. These Republican agencies'' presumably are the most vulnerable to the risk of losing future appropriations. Democratic agencies'' (and neutral agencies''), facing no significant threats to their appropriations, did not respond to the election as strongly. Finally, more vulnerable districts received the most support, especially by the Republican agencies.'' We reaffirmed these results by using the 2010 congressional elections, in which the political orientations of the districts favored with more contract distributions was reversed.","[Kasdin, Stuart; Lin, Luona] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Kasdin, S (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, 805 21st St,NW Suite 601l, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",skasdin1@yahoo.com,"Kasdin, Stuart/R-8400-2019","Kasdin, Stuart/0000-0003-4820-6625",,,,,37,9,12,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,309,329,,10.1007/s11127-015-0280-9,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500008,0

In equilibrium, the two sources of value creation in LBOs, operational improvements and financing, are complements. Moreover, sponsors that never add operational value cannot add value through financing either. Club deals are beneficial ex post by allowing low-reputation bidders with high valuations to borrow reputation from high-reputation bidders with low valuations, but they can destroy value by reducing bidders' investment in reputation.

Componentwise boosting is capable of producing parsimonious models from a, possibly, large number of predictors and in contrast to other related techniques allows a straightforward interpretation of the parameter estimates. Considering a wide range of potential risk drivers, we apply boosting to derive monthly volatility predictions for the equity market represented by S&P 500 index. Comparisons with commonly-used GARCH and EGARCH benchmark models show that our approach substantially improves out-of-sample volatility forecasts for short- and longer-run horizons.

We study the sensitivity of the interaction between the interest rate guarantee and the asset allocation when the risk-free interest rate changes. Particular attention is paid to the current market situation where the guaranteed interest rate is often close to the risk-free interest rate. In a second step, we assess at what level the interest rate guarantee should be set by the regulator in order to maximize policyholders' utility.

Therefore, urban agriculture is seen as an experimental model through which we can analyze the interaction between local institutions and citizens, as well as being a marketing tool to promote sustainability aspects linked to the territory. To this end, after a bibliographic review on the Qualitative Risk Analysis and the involvement of stakeholders in decisions relating to the public sector, a valuation of certain projects on the theme of urban and peri-urban agriculture, advanced by the local public Administration will be shown. The analysis proceeds with the classification of projects according to defined risk categories and their graphical representation through probability-impact matrix. The matrix shows that the data scores and the ranking vary significantly for each of the different projects involved. In this respect, the main purpose of this paper is to reveal how the success of a marketing policy based on the concept of sustainable marketing for promoting the territory depends, in many cases, not only on the characteristics of the territory analyzed, but also on the level of riskiness associated with the projects. Consequently, the empirical results of the paper can be a guide for public organizations, dealing with a plurality of projects but with limited resources, to assess and to prioritize projects using the level of riskiness as a criterion. Furthermore, economic resources could be directed to manage projects after taking into account the relevant risk ranking.","[Lanfranchi, Maurizio; Giannetto, Carlo; De Pascale, Angelina] Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy; [Hornoiu, Remus Ion] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Messina; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Hornoiu, RI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",rhornoiu@yahoo.com,"lanfranchi, maurizio/B-6927-2013; Hornoiu, Remus Ion/HFA-6604-2022","lanfranchi, maurizio/0000-0002-2372-2730; GIANNETTO, Carlo/0000-0002-6348-3164; De Pascale, Angelina/0000-0002-7550-9798; HORNOIU, REMUS ION/0000-0002-8509-4928",,,,,51,6,8,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,872,890,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700003,0

Based on a unique database built using supervision data from the Central Bank of Brazil, we evaluate the effectiveness of the Central Bank's supervision over banks given the Central Bank's proprietary credit rating and signaling requests for higher capital buffers. We also examine the main determinants of capital buffer management in addition to supervision. We find evidence that (i) Brazilian Central Bank supervision imposes excess capital buffer needs on banks, especially small and midsize banks; (ii) market discipline may play no role in driving capital ratios; and (iii) the business cycle has a negative influence on bank capital cushions, suggesting pro-cyclical capital management. We conclude that supervision plays a major role in markets where market discipline is weak and for smaller banks which act on pro-cyclical way. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This allows firms to reduce performance-based compensation and can rationalize loss-making acquisitions. When choosing its acquisition policy and the quality of its board, each firm ignores the adverse effect on other firms' acquisition opportunities and takeover threat. As a result, the takeover market is not sufficiently liquid and too few takeovers occur. Furthermore, liquidity in the takeover and managerial labor markets are inversely related. When poaching managers becomes more profitable, firms invest more in board quality which in turn reduces the incidence of takeovers.","[Burkart, Mike] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burkart, Mike] Swedish House Finance, CEPR ECGI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Raff, Konrad] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",Stockholm School of Economics; Swedish House of Finance; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Burkart, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,Jan Wallander foundation; Tom Hedelius foundation,Jan Wallander foundation; Tom Hedelius foundation,"We would like to thank Franklin Allen (the editor), an anonymous referee, Catherine Casamatta, Brandon Chen, Nicola Gennaioli, Denis Gromb, Alexander Guembel, Camelia Kuhnen, Matthew Rafferty, Andrei Simonov, Per Stromberg, and seminar and conference participants at the Edwards Symposium on Corporate Governance 2010, the 2010 EFA Meeting, the 2010 ESSFM, the 2010 FIRS Conference, the Fourth CEPR-Bank of Italy conference, the 2010 ECCCS workshop in Lille, the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN), the Stockholm School of Economics, and the Toulouse School of Economics for helpful comments and suggestions.

Transforming the once-dominant smallholding, family-based agriculture has become a focal point of the government's programme of rural rejuvenation, where a range of economic changes unleashed by urbanization and industrialization also converge. We argue that in this new context, agrarian change has become the key vantage point from which to study rural China. We review key contributions of the papers in this special issue and highlight their insights on rural differentiation, land politics and rural livelihoods. We discuss how studying the Chinese path' of agrarian transition can contribute to ongoing debates on key themes in agrarian studies, including both the agrarian questions of capital and of labour, and how agrarian political economy offers unique perspectives on the overall processes of capitalist development in China.","[Zhang, Qian Forrest] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Oya, Carlos] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Ye, Jingzhong] China Agr Univ, Dev Studies, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jingzhong] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",Singapore Management University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Zhang, QF (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",forrestzhang@smu.edu.sg; co2@soas.ac.uk; yejz@cau.edu.cn,"Zhang, Qian Forrest/F-9094-2010","Zhang, Qian Forrest/0000-0002-5004-6715; Oya, Carlos/0000-0003-0379-6377; Ye, Jingzhong/0000-0003-4917-3431",,,,,51,57,62,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using observed portfolio decisions to proxy for risk taking, we find correlation with two of such individual-specific events: having been victim of a physical attack and (especially) the loss of a child are associated with lower and less frequent investments in risky assets, with an intensity similar to that of the beginning, in 2008, of a collectively experienced event such as the recent financial crisis. We also find evidence that the correlation of risk taking with a child loss is long-lasting, as opposed to the correlation with a physical attack that disappears after few years. Our analysis is more in favor of a preference-based - rather than a belief-based - explanation of the observed change in risk taking. Overall our findings indicate that the past, especially through the loss of a child, casts a long shadow that extends over individuals' current decisions also within unrelated domains.

However, little is known about the consequences of bailouts granted conditional on local governments first making efforts to improve the situation. We examine a case in which the Swedish central government provided conditional grants to 36 financially troubled municipalities. We use the synthetic control method to identify suitable comparison units for each of the 36 municipalities. To compare the development of costs and the fiscal surplus of admitted municipalities to that of their most similar counterparts during the decade after the program, we then estimate fixed effects regressions on the resulting sample. The analysis suggests that conditional bailouts did not erode, and may even have improved, fiscal discipline. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study used transport networks as a proxy for human mobility to generate the spatial process of TB incidence. It examined the association between TB incidence and four types of transport networks at the provincial level: provincial roads, national roads, highways, and railways. Geographical information systems and geospatial analysis were used to examine the spatial distribution of 2217 smear-positive TB cases reported between 2009 and 2011 in the Shandong province. The study involved factors such as population density and elevation difference in conjunction with the types of transport networks to predict the disease occurrence in space. It identified spatial clusters of TB incidence linked not only with transport networks of the regions but also differentiated by elevation. Our research findings provide evidence of targeting populous regions with well-connected transport networks for effective surveillance and control of TB transmission in Shandong.

We study all flights (about 3000) on all regional routes (about 250) with scheduled airline service from one of about 130 regional towns or cities, in regional airline markets in six countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and a sample of three U.S. states which closely resemble the other regions studied. For each flight we have observations on up to five prices offered at different times before flight date. We also have equipment type and social-economic data. Overall, our results give qualified support to the standard gravity model of the extent of service between city pairs, though with two interesting differences: operators on regional routes have greater flexibility in the size of aircraft they can deploy, which results in a finer-grained variability of service offerings and, the presence of competition on regional routes has a large effect on the total supply of seats. We are able to successfully estimate a well-specified airfare model, which shows strong effects of competition on prices, quite substantial intertemporal price discrimination, and interesting differences between regional and main trunk route pricing.

The primary aim of our investigation is the potential of ERI in practice. The performance of this strategy is benchmarked against the minimum variance portfolio and the equally weighted portfolio. These fundamental strategies are important benchmarks for large-scale applications. Our comparison includes annualized portfolio returns, maximal drawdowns, transaction costs, portfolio concentration, and asset diversity in the portfolio.

Our results suggest that all three reforms would be regressive in all 12 countries, that tax liabilities increase less for employees than for nonemployees, and that the uniform rate is the best for employees and the worst for nonemployees.","[Picos-Sanchez, Fidel] GEN Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Empresariais & Turismo, Orense 32004, Spain; [Thomas, Alastair] OECD Ctr Tax Policy & Adm, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universidade de Vigo; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Picos-Sánchez, F (通讯作者)，GEN Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Empresariais & Turismo, Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, Spain.",fidel@uvigo.es; Alastair.Thomas@oecd.org,,"Picos, Fidel/0000-0003-2996-8296",OECD,OECD,Financial support by the OECD is gratefully acknowledged.,,21,4,4,2,16,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2015,71.0,2,,,,,278,298,,10.1628/001522115X14186532237317,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CM1KH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357439300006,0

After calibrating the model to the U.S. data, we quantitatively examine how aggregate activity is affected by a shock to equity liquidity and a shock to entrepreneurs' borrowing capacity. We then analyze the effectiveness of government interventions in the asset market after such financial shocks.

In this article, I use partial equilibrium modelling to estimate the direct impacts of the agreement on Indonesia and China, and from these estimates draw political economy implications for Indonesia. Although the agreement has contributed to a modest trade surplus for Indonesia overall, it has led to a larger bilateral deficit with China. In addition, the shifts to surplus for Indonesia have mostly been in resource-based sectors, while the shifts to deficit have occurred in many manufacturing sectors that the government would like to see grow. I argue that pushback against the agreement has contributed to a resurgence of non-tariff trade barriers in the country, although other political economy forces also have been at work. The agreement ultimately provides a cautionary tale: cutting regional import tariffs can lead to pressures for more complex and less transparent trade policies.","Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Marks, SV (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,,"Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) Project; United States Agency for International Development; Ministry of Trade, Republic of Indonesia","Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) Project; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Ministry of Trade, Republic of Indonesia","This article is a revision of a previous study (Marks 2012a), which was produced under the auspices of the Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) Project, United States Agency for International Development and Ministry of Trade, Republic of Indonesia.

First, volatility smile obtained from alternative interest rate models is not flat and interest rate smile significantly relates to survey sentiment after controlling for fundamental and liquidity variables. Second, a dynamic relation between sentiment proxies and interest rate smiles meets the limit to arbitrage hypothesis, which is the focal point of market friction. Third, the relation between survey sentiment proxies and option smiles is more pronounced during the crisis period than the pre-crisis and post-crisis period. While investor sentiment drives the smile curve, interest rate models cannot fully capture the smile since these models are formulated in a frictionless environment (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The findings also suggest that the effect of financial development on growth becomes negative, if there is rapid growth in private credit not accompanied by growth in real-output.

Based on an intensive process of literature review, following the experience of other countries with a high degree of experience in this field, I created a model that illustrates a series of specific features displayed by this phenomenon, as well as a best practice guide. This guide mainly outlines a series of directions regarding financial, legislative, institutional, and educational aspects. Through this paper, I aim to bring a contribution to the development of the scientific literature in the field of returnee entrepreneurship and to raise awareness among policy makers on the complexity and importance of this phenomenon. Furthermore, by detailing the components of this model in Romania and by presenting the best practice guide, this paper may represent an important starting point in developing a national strategy for encouraging emigrants' return and the development of entrepreneurial activities among them.","[Grosu, Raluca Mariana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Grosu, RM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",raluca.petrescu@com.ase.ro,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115 Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,28,5,6,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,799,814,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900019,0

Any currency must prevent users from spending their balances more than once, which is easier said than done with purely digital currencies. Current digital currencies such as Bitcoin use peer-to-peer networks and open source software to stop double spending and create finality of transactions. This paper explains how the use of these technologies and limitation of the quantity produced can create an equilibrium in which a digital currency has a positive value. This paper also summarizes the rise of 2417 trading on computerized markets in Bitcoin in which there are no brokers or other agents. The average monthly volatility of returns on Bitcoin is higher than for gold or a set of foreign currencies in dollars, but the lowest monthly volatilities for Bitcoin are less than the highest monthly volatilities for gold and the foreign currencies.

This paper studies how clearinghouses affected bank composition and solvency during stable periods as well as panics. An annual database of all national bank balance sheets from 1865 to 1914 indicates that national banks grew larger after the creation of a clearinghouse. Relative to the rise in assets, banks reduced their cash reserves and individual deposits and increased their loans, circulation, and interbank deposits. The analysis also shows that while clearinghouse members were less likely to fail during panics, they were more likely to fail in other periods, particularly those in non-financial centers. In this way, clearinghouses seem to have freed up additional resources during stable periods and delayed bank failures until the potential for contagion was removed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A unique data set covering all patent auctions held until the end of 2008 by Ocean Tomo is used. We employ two measures of patent value drawn from the auction process: the offer price (ex ante value set by the seller) and the closing price (the market value determined by the buyers) of patent lots. We find a positive correlation between forward citations and the economic value of patents (in terms of both the lot offer price and the lot closing price), while backward citations have a positive and significant impact only on the lot offer price. The number of claims is positively related to the lot closing price and the effect is significant only for the fraction of buyers who are nonpracticing entities. The degree of technological congruence of the patents included in a lot turns out to be positively associated with the probability that the lot is sold and has a positive effect on both the lot offer price and the lot closing price. We also find a significant impact of the extent of the residual life of patents on the lot closing price. The effect is driven by the subsample of nonpracticing entities as buyers. Finally, the extension of patent protection to other jurisdictions, as captured by the size of the patent family, is positively associated with both the lot offer price and the lot closing price.","[Odasso, Cristina] ICM Res, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Scellato, Giuseppe; Ughetto, Elisa] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Ughetto, E (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",cristina.odasso@icm-research.com; giuseppe.scellato@polito.it; elisa.ughetto@polito.it,"Ughetto, Elisa/C-9313-2018; 胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022","Scellato, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0927-9346; Ughetto, Elisa/0000-0002-6019-1051",,,,,43,46,49,2,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

An individual who buys a life insurance contract early in life is often uncertain about the future financial needs of his or her family, in the event of an untimely death. Ideally, the individual would like to insure the risk of having high future bequest needs, but since bequest motives are typically unverifiable, a contract directly insuring these needs is not feasible. We derive a long-term life insurance contract that is incentive compatible and achieves a higher welfare level than the naive strategy of delaying the purchase of insurance until after one's bequest needs are known. We also examine the welfare effects of our contract and we show how third-party financial products, although beneficial to the individual in the short run, can be detrimental to one's ex ante utility.","[Fei, Wenan] Reinsurance Grp Amer, Actuary, Chesterfield, MO USA; [Fluet, Claude] Univ Quebec, Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Schlesinger, Harris] Univ Alabama, Finance, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Schlesinger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Finance, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",hschlesi@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The majority of applications rely on data containing multiple observations for each respondent, where a common assumption is that tastes stay constant across choices for the same respondent. We question this assumption and make use of a model developed in the transport field which allows tastes to vary over choices for each consumer in addition to variation across consumers. An empirical analysis making use of a stated choice dataset for wetland conservation in Belarus shows that superior performance is obtained by allowing jointly for the two types of heterogeneity and that recovery of these intra-respondent variations is not possible using standard approaches, such as allowing for scale heterogeneity across tasks. We show also that intra-respondent heterogeneity can be especially high for attributes which respondents are unfamiliar with, and that a failure to account for it can substantially affect welfare estimates. We interpret this as an indication that this heterogeneity relates primarily to uncertainty. Finally, we offer initial insights into the relationship between intra-respondent heterogeneity and findings on uncertainty in a contingent valuation context.","[Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Giergiczny, Marek] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Leeds; University of Warsaw,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@its.leeds.ac.uk; mgiergiczny@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Giergiczny, Marek/AAG-1808-2020; Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518; Giergiczny, Marek/0000-0001-9110-3897",Polish National Science Centre Grant [DEC-2012/07/E/HS4/04037],Polish National Science Centre Grant,The authors are grateful for the comments of Thijs Dekker and one anonymous referee which helped to significantly improve the paper.

Subcontractors are hired by prime contractors prior to the auction, and the subcontractor may also be a competitor in the primary auction. While horizontal subcontracting may improve productive efficiency, it softens the horizontal subcontractor's bid strategy, since winning the auction may entail losing subcontracting business. I find that while each additional competitor supplied by the firm is estimated to increase its bid by 1.4 per cent, the winning bid is uncorrelated with horizontal subcontracting.

This study exploits the structural changes in South Korea's disability employment quota system that took place in 2004 and 2006 to expand the current disability policy evaluation literature. We separate the effect of these changes in the quota system into their effect on the probability of labour force participation and their effect on the probability of employment (after controlling for selection into the labour market). We also study the extent to which the changes - which included increasing the number of employers covered by the quota system, the number of jobs available to individuals with disabilities and the financial incentives for employing individuals with disabilities - have affected job satisfaction among individuals with disabilities. Our results suggest that the changes in the quota system may have increased labour force participation but have had a limited positive impact on the probability of employment among people with disabilities in South Korea. Further, compulsory hiring and expanded opportunities have not substantially affected the level of job satisfaction observed among employees with disabilities relative to their non-disabled counterparts.","[Nazarov, Zafar] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Ft Wayne, IN USA; [Nazarov, Zafar; von Schrader, Sarah] Cornell Univ, Employment & Disabil Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kang, Dongug] Korea Natl Univ Welf, Pyeongtaek, South Korea",Purdue University System; Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne; Cornell University,"Nazarov, Z (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Ft Wayne, IN USA.",nazarovz@ipfw.edu; kdongug@gmail.com; sv282@cornell.edu,,"von Schrader, Sarah/0000-0002-3541-1374",K.

This paper examines the development of solar PV and wind energy technology component (WETC) exports from China and the competitive position of the country's renewable energy industry. We also describe the government's renewable energy policy and its success in renewable electricity generation as well as increasing renewable energy innovation and foreign knowledge accumulation, which may drive export performance. We aim at empirically identifying determinants of Chinese solar PV and WETC exports. We estimate a gravity trade model using maximum likelihood estimation. Besides controlling for standard variables, we consider additional explanatory factors by accounting for market, policy and innovation effects steaming from both importing countries and China. We use a panel dataset representing bilateral trade flows of 43 developed and developing countries that imported solar PV and WETCs from China between 1996 and 2008. Empirical results indicate that high income countries, with large renewable energy markets and demand side policy support schemes, in terms of incentive tariffs, are increasingly importing Chinese solar PV components. We show that trade costs have a negative impact on exports of solar PV components but not WETC. Additionally, we find a positive impact of research and development appropriation growth, especially from provincial governments in China, but no evidence that bilateral knowledge transfer and indigenous innovation affect exports.","[Groba, Felix] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Cao, Jing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Tsinghua University,"Groba, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",FGroba@diw.de; caojing@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,122,52,54,7,122,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In most of these models the evolutionary objective function is the maximization of the expected number of offspring, or alternatively, the maximization of the geometric-mean growth rate. We suggest that careful consideration should also be given to the objective of maximizing the probability of Having Descendants Forever, p(HDF). We show that the p(HDF) criterion implies risk aversion. Moreover, it leads to preferences that are very closely approximated by the constant relative risk aversion preferences. Thus, constant relative risk aversion can be viewed as an evolutionary-developed heuristic aimed to maximize the probability of having descendants forever. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article empirically examines whether or not firms use dividends as instruments to cope with conflicts of interest between active and passive family shareholders and how family governance practices moderate this relationship. The results show that the existence of an intra-familial conflict of interest results in a higher propensity to pay dividends and that the use of family governance practices strengthens this relationship. Additionally, the findings suggest that using family governance practices leads to a more efficient dividend policy.","[Michiels, Anneleen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Res Ctr Entrepreneurship & Family Business, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Voordeckers, Wim; Lybaert, Nadine; Steijvers, Tensie] Hasselt Univ, KIZOK Res Ctr, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium",KU Leuven; Hasselt University,"Voordeckers, W (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, KIZOK Res Ctr, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium.",anneleen.michiels@kuleuven.be; wim.voordeckers@uhasselt.be; nadine.lybaert@uhasselt.be; tensie.steijvers@uhasselt.be,"Michiels, Anneleen/AAS-2562-2021; Michiels, Anneleen/O-5763-2016; Voordeckers, Wim/C-2239-2018; Steijvers, Tensie/E-6253-2017","Michiels, Anneleen/0000-0002-2417-0106; Voordeckers, Wim/0000-0001-7041-3933; Lybaert, Nadine/0000-0002-8037-8606; Steijvers, Tensie/0000-0001-6947-4421",,,,,80,45,46,5,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The model is constructed within the framework of classical approaches of the growth theory. It is based on three production factors: capital, educated labor and useful work. GDP level is described by a production function of the Cobb-Douglas type. The utility function of the growth process is given by an integral consumption index discounted on the infinite horizon. The optimal control problem is posed to balance investments in capital and labor efficiency. The problem is solved on the basis of dynamic programming principles. A novelty of the solution consists in constructing nonlinear stabilizers constructed on the feedback principle, which leads the system from any current position to a steady state. Growth and decline trends of the simulated trajectories are studied for all components included in the model.","[Sanderson, W.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Tarasyev, A (通讯作者)，S Kovalevskaya St 16, Ekaterinburg 620990, Russia.",tarasiev@iiasa.ac.at; anastasy.ousova@gmail.com,"Sanderson, Warren/R-3398-2019; Tarasyev, Alexander M/H-9095-2016; Usova, Anastasiia A/V-4993-2017","Tarasyev, Alexander M/0000-0002-8366-9628; Usova, Anastasiia A/0000-0001-5757-066X; Sanderson, Warren/0000-0002-2205-948X",,,,,22,3,3,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In Malaysia, public listed firms must ensure accurate and timely disclosure of material information to the investors under the Companies Act 1965 and the guidelines issued by the Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia. The current change in the public listed firms reporting is the implementation of the revised guidance known as Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers which was released on 31 December 2012. The guidelines are intended to guide directors in making disclosures concerning risk management and internal control in their firm's annual report pursuant to paragraph 15.26(b) of the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirement. This study attempts a) to develop an index to measure the level of risk management and internal control disclosures for Malaysian listed firms and b) to measure the relationship between the board characteristics and risk management and internal control disclosures level among Malaysian public listed firms. The sample of this study consists of 150 firms listed in the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia for the year 2013.

Although these small farms have a less important role on the markets, they are important in the rural world, as they provide food and social security for the population, contributing to environment preservation through the use of traditional production methods. The paper attempts to investigate the small farm role in the economy of rural areas and in the welfare of peasant households. The data source used were the Agricultural Census, for the analysis of small farm production structure and the Household Budget Survey in order to reveal the importance of own resources in the food consumption and incomes of rural households. The main conclusions of the paper refer to the strong production diversification on the small farms compared to the large farms, which are much more specialized. The analysis of food consumption behavior of the rural households reveals high shares of self-consumption in most products, a lower food diversification compared to urban households and a lower cost of calories in the rural households diet.

We measure uncertainty as the cross-sectional dispersion of shocks to bank-level variables. Comparing this measure of uncertainty in banking to more traditional measures of uncertainty, we find similar but no identical patterns. Higher uncertainty in banking has negative effects on bank lending. This effect is heterogeneous across banks: lending by banks that are better capitalized and have higher liquidity buffers tends to be affected less. Also, the degree of internationalization matters, as loan supply by banks in financially open countries is affected less by uncertainty. The impact of the ownership status of the individual bank is less important, in contrast.","[Buch, Claudia M.] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Buchholz, Manuel] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Germany; [Tonzer, Lena] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Financial Markets Dept, Halle, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Buch, CM (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,International Monetary Fund (IMF); Dutch National Bank (DNB); IMF; DNB,International Monetary Fund (IMF); Dutch National Bank (DNB); IMF; DNB,"Professor Claudia M.

Numerous works of literature support that the most important asset and the most beneficial resource of an organization is the human workforce. This human asset can be exploited the most effectively if HR professionals obtain a new approach, and they become strategic partners and business consultants, as they will have a key role in maximizing the recovery of these investments. The success of the HR function depends on this ability to create value through the business activity as well as to lead the reorganization strategy and outplacement process that is necessary for business success. What makes my research important and timely is that I create a guide about what strategies and methods HR professionals can apply to increase business competitiveness that is getting more and more emphasis nowadays.

Unemployment is used to represent real economic activity. Phillips curve links unemployment with inflation and Taylor rule describes the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. The results from econometric estimation indicate that interest rate policy Of the European Central Bank has only a very limited effect on unemployment. Furthermore, the reaction coefficient for inflation in the Taylor rule does not support Taylor principle. This paper also presents original method for measuring NAIRU.

While OECD banks reduced their presence (though they still control 89 percent of foreign banks' assets), non-OECD banks more than doubled theirs. Banks from countries facing systemic crises exited (more distant) markets and curtailed their subsidiaries' growth. Banks were more likely to sell smaller, more recent investments and enter closer and more important trading partners, shunning crisis and euro area countries. Lending locally grew more than cross-border claims did, but related to different factors. Altogether, the paper shows that global banking is not becoming more fragmented, but rather going through some important structural transformations with a greater variety of players and a more regional focus.","[Claessens, Stijn] Univ Amsterdam, Board Governors, Fed Reserve Syst, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Claessens, Stijn; Van Horen, Neeltje] CEPR, London, England",University of Amsterdam; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Claessens, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Board Governors, Fed Reserve Syst, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,U.K. Department for International Development research project on macroeconomic policy in low-income countries,U.K. Department for International Development research project on macroeconomic policy in low-income countries,"Stijn Claessens is with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, University of Amsterdam, and CEPR, and Neeltje van Horen is with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and CEPR.

The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no.32/2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, as well as of insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive 2002/83/EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts.

The method utilized exploratory factor analysis (EFA), identifying four factors and corresponding drivers. A comparison was performed between two groups of farmers utilizing a Student's t-test. Results found significant differences between farmers engaged in horizontal arrangements from farmers who were not.

This is why managers' attention on the profit only is increasingly transformed in the strategic orientation that includes socially responsible activities. In the process, orientation towards the implementation of energy efficiency programs is one of the key areas, which indicates the level of company's commitment to socially responsible business activities. In other words, company's socially responsible conduct in the field of energy efficiency is nowadays related to the economic stability and sustainable development of company's business environment. Consequently, such company frequently becomes the prism through which the level of company's social responsibility is seen and measured. Improvement of energy efficiency should be a priority in formulating the strategies of sustainable development in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) which is one of the prerequisites for the EU membership. Concerning the fact that energy efficiency should be observed as a socio-economic concept basically focused on increased competitiveness and well-being in BiH, Bosnian and Herzegovinian companies should be prepared for rational energy management. The aim of this paper is to analyze the situation in the field of socially-responsible business activities of BiH companies, all in the context of implementing the energy efficiency concept in the function of economic development in BiH.

One relies on the target-saving explanation and the other on utility maximization over a life cycle. We attempt to reconcile the two approaches within a framework where a migrant has a well-defined savings target (in planning to purchase a new home at origin) but also chooses the time of return and the consumption path to maximize lifetime utility.

And where to draw the line between safe floats and risky intermediate regimes? Our findings, based on a sample of 50 emerging market economies over 1980-2011, show that macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities are significantly greater under less flexible exchange rate regimes including hard pegs as compared with floats. Although not especially susceptible to banking or currency crises, hard pegs are significantly more prone to growth collapses, suggesting that the security of the hard end of the prescription is largely illusory. Intermediate regimes as a class are the most susceptible to crises, but managed floats-a subclass within such regimes behave much more like pure floats, with significantly lower risks and fewer crises. Managed floating, however, is a nebulous concept; a characterization of more crisis-prone regimes suggests no simple dividing line between safe floats and risky intermediate regimes.","[Ghosh, Atish R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ghosh, Atish R.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University,,,,,,,,,43,48,53,0,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The results of the analysis confirmed significant diversity of total values of projects, awarded grants and branches. The funded projects were implemented mostly in manufacturing. There were no beneficiaries from section H and section I which are very important for Pomerania's economy. Most of the projects concerned implementation activity and only few of them were related to investment in R&D activity. More expensive projects and projects implemented in cooperation were more frequently financed with credit. In most cases firms have not declared employment growth.

However, the effects are typically small and frequently not statistically significant. Moreover, in no case are the results uniform across the benchmarks used.

This fact has been the cornerstone of the venture to establish a social dimension of the European Union, since it gives employees the right to information and consultation as part of the effort to develop a socially responsible transnational management. This paper includes several results of a conducted research on the introduction and functioning of European Works Councils in a Balkan industrial relations system. The research concentrated on the oil/lubricants and food/beverage sectors. More specifically, the scope of the research was to test the hypothesis that EWCs create added value (positive or negative) in industrial relations within subsidiaries of MNCs in Greece and to explore the determining factors of that fact, using a qualitative approach in a combination of several case studies and interviews with representatives of the parties concerned. The research findings indicate that on the one hand EWCs contribute to the creation of positive added value (benefits) to those companies and on the other hand the negative added value (costs) is very limited. Furthermore, this paper searches the contributing factors to the EWCs added value such as internationalisation of the company, trade union structure, previous experience on workers participation schemes etc. The paper concludes that EWCs are more effective in internationalised corporations, which face the challenge of more concentrated industrial relations at a transnational level (Euro-companies) than in other enterprises, which adopt a more decentralised and national-oriented industrial relations model. Moreover, according to the research findings, whereas the European trade unions have acted for several years as pressure groups for the adoption of EWC directive, the MNCs meet the most important benefits by the EWCs function.

In absolute terms, the highest level of net working capital throughout the analysed period is reached by the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector. The ratio of net working capital to current assets in this sector exceeded the threshold of sixty percent, pointing to a very moderate way of its management. On the contrary, the minimum values are achieved by the sector of Accommodation and Food Service Activities, where since 2007 the net working capital is increasingly negative. With a few exceptions, we can state, that the most involved on the structure of the net working capital from the current assets are the short-term receivables; inventories are involved the least. Contradictory effect of short-term bank loans is recorded minimally. This implies that short-term payables exclusively have a lowering effect on the level of net working capital.","[Kozakova, Petra; Pevna, Jana] Univ Econ, Fac Management, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindruchuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic",,"Kozáková, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Management, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindruchuv Hradec 37701, Czech Republic.",petra.kozakova@fm.vse.cz; pevnaja@fm.vse.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,287,294,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200039,0

Intellectual capital is the capacity to transform knowledge and intangible assets into wealth, and its management is the process of extracting value from that same knowledge. Worldwide, tourism has been one of the fastest growing sectors in recent decades. In Portugal in particular, it is one of the country's principal economic activities and a strategic area for the competitiveness of the economy. This communication presents a part of the results of a comprehensive study analysing the impact of intellectual capital ( human capital, structural capital, and relational capital) on the organizational performance of the hotels in the Greater Lisbon and Setubal Peninsula area. The results that are reported are only those concerning relational capital, an invaluable and scarce resource that is hard to imitate, transfer, or replace, and that has a long life expectancy. The research project was carried out in 2012. Exploratory interviews were conducted, and, as the instrument of measurement, a questionnaire was addressed to the managers of the 167 hotels located in the study area. The aim was to gauge their perceptions in relation to the different components of intellectual capital and to the key organizational performance indicators that are commonly used in the sector. The methods and results concerning the relational capital component of the overall study are presented and discussed. The managers highlighted the importance of meeting their clients' needs and wishes, of fostering client loyalty, of collecting and disseminating their feedback, of brand recognition, and of maintaining a permanent market orientation. Relational capital includes elements whose nature is external to the hotel, and therefore beyond its control. Their effects on the organization's performance, given the current context of severe and prolonged economic crisis, need to be analysed with particular care.

Therefore they are trying to reduce public spending and increase tax revenues by the growth of the various types of taxes. It is necessary to realize that the negative impact of the labour taxation on the economic growth will be probably compounded through its influence and connectedness to the labour market. From this reason economic policy makers should examine the impact of the personal income taxes and social security contributions on the economic growth. Therefore the aim of the article was to identify the relationship between the labour taxation and the economic growth in OECD countries for time interval 2000-2011. The empirical analysis was based on the methods and tests of a panel regression and the level of taxation was approximated by tax quota and implicit tax rates. In case of both approximators there was proven the negative relationship with the economic growth which means that labour taxation through its connectedness to the labour market is harmufl for the economic growth. This harmfulness was with regard with other taxes the highest.,"[Macek, Rudolf] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Macek, R (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",rudolf.macek@vsb.cz,"Macek, Rudolf/R-1701-2019","Macek, Rudolf/0000-0001-7555-9157",,,,,41,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,499,508,,,,,,10,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300053,0

State regulatory institutions for this industry also vary considerably. Some states have specialized regulatory boards with industry personnel (guards, firm owners) and/or public police as board members, while others rely on non-specialized regulators such as Departments of Commerce, State, Professional Regulation, or Consumer Affairs. These cross-state variations in licensing requirements and regulatory institutions provide an opportunity to explore relationships between the two. Private security regulation is of particular interest in this context because previous empirical research implies that allocating more resources to private security reduces crime, and that relatively stringent licensing requirements limit entry, thereby increasing crime. A panel of 1991-2010 state data is employed to see if particular regulatory institutions are associated with particular licensing requirements. Empirical results suggest that requirements for entry into this market tend to be relatively strict when active private security personnel are in control of licensing, and that different patterns of regulation generally apply when police or non-specialized agencies control licensing. Therefore, both public-interest and private-interest explanations for the observed relationships between the structure of regulatory institutions and resulting licensing requirements are discussed.","[Meehan, Brian; Benson, Bruce L.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Meehan, B (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",bmeehan@fsu.edu; bbenson@fsu.edu,,,,,,,38,13,16,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,97,117,,10.1007/s11127-014-0203-1,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000006,0

Starting from the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the implementation of contemporary MMIPs and successful business results, the paper describes the method and the results of the research undertaken on the large sample of large manufacturing companies from five different industries in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By using the appropriate statistical methods (regression analysis and variance analysis), the authors have proven the existence of positive correlation between Croatian Coefficient of Innovativness, as the chosen representative of the contemporary MMIPS, and the business success measured by the Business Excellence Index, as well as the adequacy of the regression model. The research evidence of the positive impact of the implementation of chosen MMIP on achieving the business excellence, based on the applied research methodology, has both scientific and practical value. The scientific value is based on the initiation of further research on the interconnection between the implementation of contemporary models described in the paper (IMP3rove, Innovation Radar, IPScore, Innovate, Croatian Coefficient of Innovativness) and achieving the business excellence of the company, that will undoubtedly lead to creating solid bases for building the better competitiveness of companies. The practical value of the paper is based on highlighting the low awareness of MMIPs in Bosnia and Herzegovinia, which calls an action for increasing the level of familiarity with and implementation of those model that will consequently allow managers to achieve better business result for their companies.","[Mihic, Andrijana Ostojic] Univ Mostar, Fac Sci & Educ, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg; [Umihanic, Umihana] EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Umihanic, Bahrija] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Mostar; European Business School (EBS) University; University of Tuzla,"Mihic, AO (通讯作者)，Univ Mostar, Fac Sci & Educ, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",ostojicandrijana@gmail.com; umihana.umihanic@hotmail.com; bahrija.umihanic@untz.ba,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,465,480,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700028,0

Administration of Markets and Fairs Public Services from Craiova, Iasi, and Timisoara are providing public services consumed by the user, by means of contracts and subscription agreements with individuals or legal entities, either to achieve or to exploit the operation of commercial spaces. Administration is done in order to meet common public interest, but in terms of economic efficiency. Managerial success of the Administration of Markets and Fairs Public Service is determined by its ability to identify customer needs and provide products and/or services to satisfy their need by the attraction of small producers and farmers offering organic products. In public service, the results have to be oriented to citizens concomitantly with cost optimization. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Civil Service for the Administration of Markets and Fairs for three major cities in Romania, with a common set of indicators and indices. The commons variable are: population served, the total population of each city, market areas, their number and their distribution for each city, etc.. This analysis helps halls to get closer to the citizen by identifying directions for action in order to increase the satisfaction of citizens served. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is used to investigate the characteristics of the Czech economy before and after the financial crisis in 2008. This small open economy model contains Taylor-type monetary rule, price and wage rigidities, and search and matching frictions. The wages setting mechanism and hours worked are the result of the Nash bargaining process. Model parameters are estimated using the quarterly data of the Czech Republic for the period 1999: Q1 - 2014: Q3. The model is able to match the business cycle properties of key economic variables relatively well. The results show that the reactions of variables to monetary shock are quite similar in both examined periods providing a clear path of the transmission mechanism. The wage rigidities are considerably higher after the crisis. Surprisingly, the estimated bargaining power of firms is relatively low throughout the whole time span. On the other hand, hiring an additional employee is rather costly.","[Papai, Adam] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pápai, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",papai@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,676,684,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000074,0

Selected indicators have been used to evaluate MD. One of them is the budget responsibility indicator. This indicator will be compulsory for municipalities based on approving the CR constitution law. Another indicator is the share of debt in the total municipality assets. We have used a system approach for executing this analysis. The analysis has showed that on the entire sample of municipalities, there are no municipalities in the individual size categories that would show critical values of both examined indicators.","[Petr, Pavel; Provaznikova, Romana; Krupka, Jiri] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Petr, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",pavel.petr@upce.cz; romana.provaznikova@upce.cz; jiri.krupka@upce.cz,"Provazníková, Romana/IXW-5904-2023","Provazníková, Romana/0000-0001-5584-5690",,,,,23,1,1,1,7,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

For that, micro-data for both the treatment group and the control group were collected through a survey elaborated on 641 respondents by the National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection in October 2014. The propensity score matching technique was applied in order to evaluate the effects of the training programs on employment in Romania on two time dimensions, namely both at the end of the training labour market policy in 2013 and also at the end of the survey analysis in October 2014. In both cases the results indicate a slightly negative net impact on employment, suggesting that an unemployed attending a training program has less chances to find a job than someone similar in characteristics, but who did not apply for a training program. The subjective evaluation was done by measuring the opinion of the training services beneficiaries related to the measure's usefulness in finding a job. These results are to some extent surprising, but could imply that the labour market policy implemented in Romania should more rigorously identify and target the unemployed segment it addresses in order to improve its efficiency.

The existence of systemic banks provides a rationale for the central bank to act as lender of last resort for non-systemic banks in a larger range of their liquidity shortfalls.

We test following hypothesis: The high rigidity of the labour markets in the EU increases the rate of youth unemployment. Further, we analyse the correlation between the rigidity of the EU labour markets and youth unemployment rate. There is some evidence that Employment Protection Legislation index (EPL) is one of the key factors influencing youth unemployment. However, the results have differed significantly the according to the various regions (socio-economics models) of the EU. In the end of the paper the research leads to the conclusion that if the education system allows a smooth transition between school and work, a higher rate of EPL doesn't increase youth unemployment.

We also discuss how the stationary point is dependent on the level of technology, on the size of land and on the productivity of work.","[Prazak, Pavel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Prazák, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",pavel.prazak@uhk.cz,"Prazak, Pavel/F-8299-2013","Prazak, Pavel/0000-0001-9160-5758","Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove [2108]; Czech Science Foundation [14-02424S]","Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)","This paper was written by partial support of specific grant #2108 of Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove and the Czech Science Foundation grant #14-02424S.",,7,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-550-9,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,5,,,,116,122,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BK1YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432426600016,0

Private sector organizations continue to apply more sophisticated management accounting technologies to support their complex structures and activities. Such practices have been regarded as mediums for enabling organizations to create long-term value emerging from excellent organizational performance. Numerous claims alleging that management accounting had somewhat lost its relevance as it failed to provide adequate support to managers who faced intense challenges within competitive world's economy which was characterized by globalization and rapid technological advancement. In essence, management accounting can be considered as governance at source that supports organizations through the provision of accounting information. This proposal aims to develop measures for Management Accounting Best Practices Award for Public Sector Organizations in improving Malaysia's CPI. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in data collections. Whilst showcasing management accounting excellence has been an important agenda, we believe that management accounting is also needed by public sector organizations, especially with the rising concerns on poor public service deliveries and unfavorable rating of the Corruption Perception Index (CPI). CPI is used to measure the transparency, accountability, and integrity, in view of these, the introduction of the Management Accounting Award for Public Sector Organizations is a must. This proposal also involves modifying existing measures used by National Award for Management Accounting (NAfMA) Best Practices for Private Sector Organizations on 2004, to stimulate effective and efficient decision making processes to suit public sector organizations' contexts. A proposed new framework should reflect the following as preliminary measures: leadership, management accounting information, resource management, community and customer focus, stakeholder partnership management, performance management and service delivery outcomes. The management accounting measures used to propose Award should promote mainly on transparency, accountability, and integrity among Public Sector Organizations.

One of the key financial institutions of the governmental finance system is the pension funds. Historically, the Russian pension system was controlled by the government. In December 1990, the Pension Fund of Russia was established, which is obligated to insure pensions of individuals. In 1992, the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation On Non-State Pension Funds initiated the process of their buildup, which started in 1993.

A relatively simple and convenient way to analyze a company's financial status is by using cash flow information. The present study examines eight types of cash flow patterns used as an alternative tool to predict financial distress incidence. The cash flow patterns derived from positive and negative signs of cash flow components which consist of operating, investing and financing activities. The data collected consists of 124 Malaysian public listed companies covering the period of 2006 until 2013. The main objective of the study is to find out whether there is any significant relationship between cash flow patterns and financial distress incidence. The results found that companies are more likely to experience financial distress situation when the company generates positive cash inflow from daily operation activities and use the cash generated to finance future investment and long term debt. Besides, the companies are also more likely in distressed situation when they are unable to cover its short term obligation due to insufficient cash inflows generated from the main operating activities. Distressed companies are more likely to acquire external financing since the excess of cash generated from operating activities is insufficient. When the company experienced outflows in all operating, investing and financing activities, there is high tendency for the company to go bankrupt. The results also revealed that there is a significant difference between distressed and healthy companies in incidence of different patterns of cash flow. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, Fama and French (1992) challenged CAPM theory and argued that the market capitalization of firms rather than beta had an effect on the stock expected return. Moreover, Fama and French improved the CAPM equation and added two more factors into consideration. This paper reproduces the methods and results of Fama and French (1992), and discusses the relationships among stock expected return, beta and size. This study uses the data in NYSE/AMEX stock market from 1928 to 1989.

The financial market is rather less liquid, which means that firms have limited access to currency derivatives. As a consequence, it can be expected that firms are more exposed to exchange rate risk which may affect the expected cash flows and thus the firm value as well. The paper aims to examine the exchange rate exposure of firms operating in Czech Republic on the basis of stock prices and corporate cash flows and presents results of the level of exchange rate exposure of a sample of publicly listed companies and more than 7,000 large, medium sized and small firms of 8 different industries from 2003 - 2012, resp. 2014 using panel regression and orthogonalized exposure regressions and market model. Results show that significant percentages of publicly listed firms and some small and medium sized groups of firms are exposed, thus the exchange rate risk measuring and hedging is crucial for reduction of the firms' uncertainty.","[Stavarek, Daniel; Tomanova, Lucie] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stavárek, D (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",stavarek@opf.slu.cz; tomanova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,747,755,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300079,0

These tools are mostly designed for matching corporate positions to certain elite employees rather than covering disadvantaged groups, SMEs and NGOs. Key features of present systems are determined by a core team of experts according to the aggregate requirements of an average target user. Designing an inclusive recruitment system requires a rigorous conceptualization phase where all stakeholders actively participate within a multidisciplinary approach with the collaboration of engineers with social. In this paper, we embraced a user-centered approach to determine the relative importance of different online recruitment tool features for diverse users and conducted conjoint analysis to determine the needs, requirements and expectations of different stakeholders, male-female job seekers and job providers from SME or MNEs, We performed requirement-based segmentation on the output from the conjoint analysis to isolate homogeneous user segments. The results demonstrated that there are significant differences between the groups and suggest that conjoint analysis can provide systematic input for process modeling to customize online tools according to the requirements of different stakeholders.","[Suerdem, Ahmet; Akalin, Muge Gizem Bicakci] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Business Adm, Beyoglu, Turkey",Istanbul Bilgi University,"Suerdem, A (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Business Adm, Beyoglu, Turkey.",asuerdem@bilgi.edu.tr; gizem.bicakci@gmail.com,"suerdem, ahmet/AAJ-4523-2021","suerdem, ahmet/0000-0001-5692-8594",,,,,51,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,239,252,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_19,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400019,0

When the economy is growing, business opportunities open up and encourage the setup of new firms. In downturns, self-employment may be a way to avoid unemployment. The strength of these pull and push factors may depend on the amount of human capital a person has. The findings in this paper show that although the local business cycle is of minor importance for total self-employment rates in Sweden, there are heterogeneous effects across groups. People with higher human capital endowments are more likely to be pulled into self-employment, while those with lower human capital endowments are to a larger extent pushed into self-employment. This pattern is particularly strong for women. The study contributes to our knowledge of how individuals respond to business cycle changes as well as towards understanding why the association between the business cycle and self-employment rates differ across countries.","[Svaleryd, Helena] Uppsala Univ, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Svaleryd, Helena] UCLS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Svaleryd, Helena] UCFS, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Svaleryd, H (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, POB 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",helena.svaleryd@nek.uu.se,,"Svaleryd, Helena/0000-0003-3072-5224",,,,,22,30,34,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This results in an increasing demand for suitable new business locations. Previous research has indicated that accessibility is a key factor in the location decision making process. Though the literature on this subject is extensive, little research has been done to quantify the impact of the different dimensions of accessibility on the location decision process of logistics companies. This paper aims to fill this void in the literature by means of a revealed preference study (using a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis) and a stated preference study (using a designed discrete choice experiment) in Flanders (Belgium). The results of the revealed preference study served as input to the design of the choice situations in the stated preference study. In the stated preference study, the respondents were confronted with a series of choice situations described by means of accessibility variables as well as land rent information. An analysis of the resulting data by means of discrete choice modeling revealed that land rent is the most important factor in the location choice of logistics companies in Flanders. Access to a port is the second most important factor, followed by access to a motorway, the location in a business park and an inland navigation terminal, which are all about equally important. Access to a rail terminal plays no significant role in the location choice of logistics companies in Flanders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing the retirement age, as an important way to maintain long-term financial sustainability, became the main policy choice for Chinese old-age insurance. Some studies show that raising the retirement age can effectively take the pressure off on public pension solvency. However, if the pension benefits increase with the pensionable age, it may offset some effect and even has a negative impact on the system's financial state in some period. This article explains the relationship between financial balance and retirement age under PAYGO and funded system, and develops an actuarial balance model for pension system to measure the effects of raising the retirement age on financial sustainability. In the quantitative analysis, we forecast the insured population and take into account real contribution base and some dynamic factors including gradually urbanization and increasing coverage. We calculate the individual benefit, cash flows in the future 75 years of the pension scheme and long-term actuarial balance under specific retirement age, and analyze the effect of increasing the retirement age on long-term financial balance. The result shows that increasing the retirement age, the insured's benefit will increase with the rise of contribution years and the salaries, thus the replacement ratio and individual account longevity payment will increase significantly. Therefore, in a certain period, extending retirement age will improve the yearly payment of the old-age insurance and have little effect on improving financial balance or contribute little to sustainability of the scheme. We suggest, at present, establishing a mechanism to encourage more contribution is the more effective way to reduce payment stress.","[Wang Xiaojun; Shan Ge] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Room1005A,Mingde Main Bldg,Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Room1005A,Mingde Main Bldg,Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",xiaojun_wang@ruc.edu.cn; shangehope@ruc.edu.cn,"Shan, Ge/B-7323-2016",,,,,,7,0,0,2,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,557,567,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500039,0

Participants trade two long-lived securities in a continuous open-book system. The experimental design emulates the stationary, infinite-horizon setting of the model and incentivizes participants to smooth consumption across periods. Consistent with the model, prices align with consumption betas and comove with aggregate dividends, particularly so when risk premia are higher. Trading significantly increases consumption smoothing compared to autarky. Nevertheless, as in field markets, prices are excessively volatile. The noise corrupts traditional generalized method of moment tests. Choices display substantial heterogeneity, with no subject representative for pricing.","[Asparouhova, Elena; Bossaerts, Peter] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Bossaerts, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Roy, Nilanjan] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zame, William] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Melbourne; City University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Asparouhova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Bossaerts, Peter/AAZ-9851-2020; Bossaerts, Peter/O-9964-2015; Asparouhova, Elena/AAB-6913-2020","Bossaerts, Peter/0000-0003-2308-2603;","Inquire Europe; Hacker Chair at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); National Science Foundation [SES-1061844, ES-1061824, SES-0079374]; Moore Foundation",Inquire Europe; Hacker Chair at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation),"Elena Asparouhova is from the University of Utah, Peter Bossaerts is from the University of Utah and the University of Melbourne, Nilanjan Roy is from the City University of Hong Kong, and William Zame is from the University of California, Los Angeles.

An Empirical Analysis,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,social trust; gender equality; fairness; values survey; worldwide,ORIGINS,"Fairness is an important factor that promotes social trust by reducing social heterogeneity and gaps between people. This paper empirically investigates whether gender equality fairness between men and women increases social trust by analyzing a global sample from the World Values Survey. The findings show that gender discriminatory values negatively affect the trust levels of both men and women, while women's status in labor, education, and political dimensions is not a significant determinant. These results indicate that values regarding gender equality (fair values) are arguably more important to social trust than the actual socioeconomic conditions of women (fair conditions). Furthermore, the effect of gender equality varies across countries with different levels of gender endowments. Gender-related values are an important factor of social trust in countries where gender equality is relatively high, but its effect is minimal in countries with greater gender discrimination. This finding implies that fairness is a more essential social value in countries where equality is already established. Finally, the empirical investigation finds a stronger effect of gender equality on men than on women especially in high gender-equal countries. This result contradicts the initial expectation that gender equality influences women more significantly and thus, the effect should be larger for them. A possible explanation for this result is that gender equality establishes a more trustworthy environment of men which increases their trust level more. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that omitting zero counts results in parameter estimates that underestimate covariate effects on refugee counts. We compare the pooled regression, which does not account for unobserved heterogeneity, and the fixed-effects method, which does not identify the effect of time-invariant covariates, and cannot shed much light when covariates vary little. We propose the pre-sample mean generalized method of moments (PSM-GMM) estimator, which accommodates the zeros, accounts for unobserved heterogeneity, but does not have the drawbacks of the fixed-effects methods when covariates exhibit little variation. In addition, using recently developed methods to estimate standard errors that are robust to dyadic correlation, we find evidence suggesting that previous findings based on underestimated standard errors mostly remain valid after properly adjusting standard errors; in particular, conflict and civil liberties in the source country and proximity are found to be significant determinants of forced migration. However, some covariates previously found to be significant, such as sharing a common language or having a colonial relationship, lose significance. In addition, we find a significant positive influence of the level of civil liberties in the destination country on the number of refugees it receives, a mechanism not explored before.","[Echevarria, Jon; Gardeazabal, Javier] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Gardeazabal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",javier.gardeazabal@ehu.eus,"Gardeazabal, Javier/G-9765-2015","Gardeazabal, Javier/0000-0001-9200-1710; Echevarria-Coco, Jon/0000-0001-8312-5666","Basque Government [PRE-2015-1-0073, IT783-13]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [ECO2015-64467-R]",Basque Government(Basque Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional,"We would like to thank Daniel Arce, Martin Gassebner, Eric Neumayer and Todd Sandler and the 2016 University of Texas at Dallas Political Violence and Policy Conference participants for very helpful comments.

To stay within 'safe' global warming guardrails requires substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. This represents a global political consensus, but there is evidence that current legislation in the transport sector is not significant enough to achieve medium- and longer-term reduction goals. In focusing on the European Union, this paper investigates the perspectives of twelve policy officers in three Directorates-General (MOVE, CLIMA, ENV) of the European Commission with regard to their understanding of mitigation goals and timelines, responsibilities for policy development and implementation, and perceived efficiencies of these policies to achieve climate objectives in the transport sector. Results indicate diverging and common views on climate policy goals and political responsibilities, as well as barriers to policy-making, including lack of political leadership on climate change mitigation, resistance from member states, the favoring of economic growth over cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, pressure from industry and lobby groups, preferential treatment of aero- and automobility over more sustainable transport modes, policy implementation delays, insufficient forecasting and monitoring tools, and an overreliance on technologies to contribute to emission reductions. In offering a view inside the 'black box' of transport policy-making, the paper reveals fundamental institutional (structural) and individual (agency-based) barriers that will have to be overcome if significant emission cuts in the transport sector are to be achieved.

It then advances a different conceptualization based on insights from heterodox economics, showing that all roles of SIBs are more about market creating/shaping rather than market-failure fixing.

The results show that municipalities are using informal shared services arrangements much less frequently than in the past. Those that have an informal agreement in place note that they are attractive because of the relative flexibility it allows, but they are wary of the inherent risk of entering into an arrangement without legal recourse. These informal arrangements, however, work well in areas in which there is a history of long-term cooperation, a high degree of trust, and some type of forum for resolution. The use of these informal arrangements, however, has been waning for years because most municipalities push for formalized agreements in an effort to insulate themselves, when possible, from the inherent risks of informal cooperation.","[Spicer, Zachary] Brock Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada",Brock University,"Spicer, Z (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Catharines, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,16,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Evidence is also found supportive of increased risk due to too-big-to-fail effects, with this risk increase being offset by a decline in large bank risk after the crisis of 2007-2008.

This paper investigates how differences between regions in terms of their vulnerability to climate change and their stage of development affect the cooperative and non-cooperative responses to this aspect of climate change. It is shown that the cooperative response to these stochastic tipping points requires converging carbon taxes for developing and developed regions. The non-cooperative response leads to a bit more precautionary saving and diverging carbon taxes.

Large loans relative to home value are perceived as riskier, as are loans with large mortgage payments relative to income and loans linked to investment vehicles. Homeowners with riskier mortgages indicated that they could encounter financial problems should house prices or their income decline. Homeowners with relatively low debt literacy are more likely to take out traditional mortgages with principal repayments over the maturity of the loan.

It is important to consider this issue, especially when there is political tension and conflict between countries. Because of their historical background, political conflict exists between Korea and Japan. This paper examines the effect of viewing Japanese anime (animation) on the attitudes of Koreans toward Japanese living in Korea. The major findings of the study show that the more frequently adult Koreans view Japanese anime, the more likely they are to accept Japanese as workplace colleagues and neighbors after controlling for endogeneity bias using instrumental variables. The findings of this paper imply that via the consumption of imported cultural goods, people are exposed to positive traits of the trading partner, and thus consumers have a stronger affinity with the export country. From this, we derive the policy implication that promoting the trade of modern cultural goods is effective in increasing mutual understanding between trading partners, thereby reducing political tension between them.","[Yamamura, Eiji] Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawara Ku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan; [Shin, Inyong] Asia Univ, Dept Econ, 5-24-10 Musashi Sakai, Tokyo 1808629, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawara Ku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,"SHIN, INYONG/0000-0002-4686-7510",,,,,29,5,6,2,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Institutional factors best explain these divergent patterns. Yet the importance of institutions in the economy is above all of a combinatorial nature. As underlined by the Varieties of capitalism and other institutional model approaches, xinstitutions will not necessarily produce the same results in different institutional contexts, and two different institutional combinations can produce similar results. These theories add an important element to understand the evolution of top incomes.","[Zorn, Nicolas] Inst Nouveau Monde, Polit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zorn, Nicolas] Chaire Rech Econ Polit Int & Comparee ENAP, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Zorn, N (通讯作者)，Inst Nouveau Monde, Polit, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Zorn, N (通讯作者)，Chaire Rech Econ Polit Int & Comparee ENAP, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",nicolas.zorn@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

To gain insight on the validity of this phenomenon and test the effect of response time on choice randomness, this study makes use of a recently conducted choice experiment survey on ecological and amenity effects of an offshore windfarm in the UK. The positive relationship between self-rated and inferred attribute attendance and response time is taken as evidence for a link between response time and cognitive effort. Subsequently, the generalised multinomial logit model is employed to test the effect of response time on scale, which indicates the weight of the deterministic relative to the error component in the random utility model. Results show that longer response time increases scale, i.e. decreases choice randomness. This positive scale effect of response time is further found to be non-linear and wear off at some point beyond which extreme response time decreases scale. While response time does not systematically affect welfare estimates, higher response time increases the precision of such estimates. These effects persist when self-reported choice certainty is controlled for. Implications of the results for online stated preference surveys and further research are discussed.","[Borger, Tobias] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",Plymouth Marine Laboratory,"Börger, T (通讯作者)，Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",tobo@pml.ac.uk,,,UK Research Councils under Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G007748/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research Councils under Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research formed part of the programme of the UK Energy Research Centre and was supported by the UK Research Councils under Natural Environment Research Council award NE/G007748/1.

To reconcile prior studies, we focus on strategic decisions related to internationalization, specifically the foreign market entry mode selection process. We suggest that the choice about entry mode is especially significant for family owners because it may either align or conflict with two key family-related goals: maintaining family control and keeping a long-term orientation of the business. We argue that these goals have different weights within family firms according to differences in ownership structure, with significant implications for international strategic decisions. We rely on a sample of medium-sized family-owned Italian firms and show that different types of family ownership structures affect entry mode decisions differently and specifically influence the time horizon of the foreign investment and willingness to cooperate with external actors. We also provide empirical evidence that the presence of a non-family manager moderates the relationship between family ownership and entry mode decisions. Our study expands on prior research by highlighting how family firms enter foreign markets and pointing out the strategic implications of family firm heterogeneity.","[Pongelli, Claudia; Caroli, Matteo Giuliano] LUISS Univ, Dept Business & Management, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Cucculelli, Marco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60100 Ancona, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Pongelli, C (通讯作者)，LUISS Univ, Dept Business & Management, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",cpongelli@luiss.it; mcaroli@luiss.it; m.cucculelli@univpm.it,"Cucculelli, Marco/J-2479-2019","Cucculelli, Marco/0000-0003-0035-9454; Pongelli, Claudia/0000-0002-1844-5994",,,,,62,49,49,5,111,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that regulation induces firms to increase leverage, and this reduces their ability to compete when deregulation occurs. Large and small levered firms adopt different strategies upon deregulation. Whereas more levered small firms charge higher prices to increase margins at the expense of market shares, highly levered large firms prey on their rivals by increasing output and reducing prices to increase their market shares. The difference in their behavior is due to differences in their probability of bankruptcy and their financing constraints.","[Reboul, Jerome] French Treasury, Savings & Financial Markets Unit, Paris, France; [Toldra-Simats, Anna] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Toldrà-Simats, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",jerome.reboul@dgtresor.gouv.fr; atoldra@emp.uc3m.es,"Simats, Anna Toldra/F-4234-2014","Simats, Anna Toldra/0000-0001-8744-8374",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2012-36559]; Fundacion Ramon Areces [2015/00442/001],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Fundacion Ramon Areces,"We thank Claude Crampes, Bruno Jullien, Antoine Loeper, Paul Malatesta (the editor), Juan-Ignacio Pena, Gordon Phillips (the referee), Pablo Ruiz-Verdu, Paola Sapienza, Daniel Wolfenzon, Luigi Zingales, and participants at the 2014 Spanish Association of Finance (AEFIN) Conference for helpful comments.

We find that when banks have no controlling shareholder or have only family and state shareholders activity diversification yields diseconomies. However, as long as the control chain involves banking institutions, institutional investors, industrial companies or any other combination of these shareholder categories, banks benefit from diversification economies: they display higher profitability, lower earnings volatility and lower default risk. This is potentially because such categories of shareholders bring additional skills to manage diverse activities. A further exploration shows that such mitigating roles are greater for domestic and diversified shareholders. Our findings provide insights on why banks suffer from greater activity diversification and have several policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The estimation of age-patterns for financial assets building shows no decumulation in retirement, on the contrary to the standard Life-Cycle Hypothesis, and no significant differences between birth cohort groups. This approach is supplemented by exploring the role played by other microeconomic determinants, such as diploma, suggesting the existence of a large diversity of accumulation patterns within each generation.

It innovates in two aspects. First, while previous studies have used partial measures of climate regulation, we estimate a measure of performance of a country's domestic efforts for climate mitigation. This measure is the difference between observed CO2 emissions levels and structural emissions, i.e. the emissions predicted by the determinants of environmental degradation as identified and modelled in the literature. Second, the effect of these efforts on bilateral trade flows is assessed using a gravity model. A difference in domestic efforts between trading partners has no effect on aggregate trade flows. Put differently, weak domestic efforts do not imply comparative advantage. In addition, similarities in domestic efforts, whether they are lax or stringent, are not shown twaffect trade flows.

Entry lowers prices, which can trigger adverse selection. The anticipated price collapse limits entry so that high prices are sustained, resulting in above normal profits. The analysis suggests that rather than observing the canonical market collapse, markets with asymmetric information about quality may have above normal profits and less entry than would be expected even when there is low concentration.","[Creane, Anthony] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY USA; [Jeitschko, Thomas D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Kentucky; Michigan State University,"Creane, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY USA.",a.creane@uky.edu; jeitschk@msu.edu,"Jeitschko, Thomas/O-7318-2019","Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235",,,,,52,6,6,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Fewer periods are detected using exchange-rate adjusted prices, and almost none when deflated prices are used. We assess whether these findings are indicative of bubble behavior. Convenience yield is shown to have little efficacy in this regard, while other fundamental proxy variables and position data offer only very limited evidence against prices having been anything other than fundamentals-driven. Possible exceptions are in gold in the run-up to the highpoint of the financial crisis, and in silver and palladium around the launch of specific financial products.

With a particular emphasis on proposed planning system reforms in the nation's largest state of New South Wales, we examine written submissions from development industry sectors, resident groups, and professional associations. We then compare these submissions to government responses, finding these responses heavily reflect industry narratives. In the context of an ongoing microeconomic reform agenda oriented towards deregulation and competition policy, housing development is framed as central to delivering economic growth, while the planning system is portrayed as a constraint holding back investment and new housing production. Through this prism, a series of rhetorical strategies reframe community concerns about housing affordability and the impact of new development to fit the growth agenda, while environmental and social considerations are largely sidelined.","[Gurran, Nicole] Univ Sydney, Fac Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ruming, Kristian] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; Macquarie University,"Gurran, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",nicole.gurran@sydney.edu.au,"Gurran, Nicole/AAR-7267-2020; Ruming, Kristian/A-7563-2011","Ruming, Kristian/0000-0003-1065-9530; Gurran, Nicole/0000-0003-2646-384X",,,,,59,24,27,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The children were between 12 and 18 years old in the first survey and between 18 and 24 years old in the second survey.

It is thus important to characterise the structure of recent medical spending using individual-level data. We use medical claim bill data from a citizen's health insurance plan in Japan to examine the concentration in and persistence of medical spending. We find that medical spending is disproportionately distributed across individuals, with the top 10 per cent of spenders responsible for over 60 per cent of total expenditures. We also find a high correlation in spending over time: the top 20 per cent of spenders have a probability of over 60 per cent of remaining in the same rank in the following year. Further, medical spending is more concentrated among those aged 064 years than among the older age group. The results also show a difference in income gradient of health expenditures across age groups. Specifically, individuals aged 25-64 in low-income families spend more on medical care than those in high-income families, whereas there is no clear association between income and health expenditures among the elderly. Finally, consistent with previous studies, we find increased medical expenses in the year of death, accounting for 17 per cent of total expenditures among those aged 65 and over.","[Ibuka, Yoko] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Chen, Stacey H.] GRIPS Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Chen, Stacey H.] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Stacey H.] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Ohtsu, Yui; Izumida, Nobuyuki] Natl Inst Populat & Social Secur Res, Tokyo, Japan",Tohoku University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Hitotsubashi University,"Ibuka, Y (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.",ibuka@econ.tohoku.ac.jp; chens@nber.org; yuiohtsu@gmail.com; izumida@ipss.go.jp,"Ibuka, Yoko/AAW-5135-2020; Chen, Stacey H./AAV-1405-2021; CHEN, Stacey/KCL-7182-2024","Ibuka, Yoko/0000-0001-5505-8988; Chen, Stacey/0000-0001-8534-7166","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24330097, 26780168]; Tohoku University Center for Equal Opportunity; Academia Sinica [CDA-103-H2]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [105-0210-01-13-03, 104-2410-H-001-010-MY2]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780168] Funding Source: KAKEN; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Tohoku University Center for Equal Opportunity; Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science #24330097 (PI: Nobuyuki Izumida) and #26780168 (PI: Yoko Ibuka), the career development grant from the Tohoku University Center for Equal Opportunity, Academia Sinica (CDA-103-H2) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (105-0210-01-13-03 and 104-2410-H-001-010-MY2).

Individuals can supplement the public good in the private market. Immigrants affect natives through three channels: (i) the labor market; (ii) tax collection; (iii) the quality of the public good. We find that the higher the political weight of the rich (highly skilled) is, the less tolerant the poor and the middle-class are toward immigration and the more demanding they are toward increasing public spending. The rich are the most favorable to immigration. As they have more weight, the political outcome is closer to their preferences and further from the preferences of the other groups.

We find that taxpayers in multifamily households reassign dependents to filers as the payoff to doing so in terms of either tax minimization or EITC benefit increases; and that the propensity to reassign dependents is greater for EITC-eligible filers.","[Jones, Maggie R.; O'Hara, Amy B.] US Bur Census, Ctr Adm Records Res & Applicat, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Jones, MR (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Adm Records Res & Applicat, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",margaret.r.jones@census.gov; amy.b.ohara@census.gov,,,,,,,26,9,9,1,3,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Consistent with models of intertemporal price discrimination, seasonality is strongly associated with market concentration among a few large banks with repeated interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In equilibrium, agents become entrepreneurs if their skill is sufficiently high or risk aversion sufficiently low. Under heavier taxation, entrepreneurs are more skilled and less risk-averse, on average. Through these selection effects, the tax rate is positively related to aggregate productivity and negatively related to the equity risk premium. Both income inequality and stock prices initially increase but eventually decrease with the tax rate.

Few decades ago attracting consumers' visual attention was easier; however, modern consumers become advertising-resistant. Moreover, people even tend to ignore ads before seeing them. Such advertising resistance leads to a situation when the creativity becomes important. As creativity in advertising has many aspects, we considered the advertising complexity as one of them. The aim of the research is to determine the influence of the complexity of print advertising on visual attention. Three objectives are set to reach the aim: (1) to determine the theoretical criteria of advertising complexity; (2) to select sample advertisements meeting each selected criterion; (3) to provide the eye-tracking experiment with the chosen advertisements. The research reveals that advertising complexity has a positive influence on consumers' visual attention to the advertisement, but negative influence on consumers' visual attention to the brand presented in the advertisement. The research enables the eye-tracking-based determination of the best suitable level of advertising complexity to attract visual attention. The analysis of experiment participants' number of eye fixations and mean viewing time enables the determination of guidelines for advertising creation.","[Pileliene, Lina; Grigaliunaite, Viktorija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Mkt, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Pileliene, L (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Mkt, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",l.pileliene@evf.vdu.lt; v.grigaliunaite@gmail.com,"Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/GXG-1429-2022; Pileliene, Lina/B-3293-2014; Pileliene, Lina/AAP-2315-2020","Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/0000-0001-8340-2993; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314",,,,,34,15,16,5,69,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

To address this question, I employ a unique data set on Finnish cooperative banks. I find that the monthly volumes of new business loans decreased and the average loan margins increased after the onset of the crisis. The decrease in volumes and the increase in margins were greater in local banking markets that were more competitive before the crisis. The results for the loan margins are more robust than those obtained for the volumes. Auxiliary analyses suggest that the greater effects in the more competitive markets are due to competition leveling therein more after the onset of the crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the degree to which foreign investments can be expected to generate employment, offer access to international technology and know-how, and ultimately create growth, varies considerably depending on the type of investment. It is therefore important to determine what type of FDI is attracted by BITs. By providing a legal commitment to the fair and equitable treatment of foreign investors, BITs aim to decrease investment risk and to attract foreign investors. We argue that BITs can be expected to be most effective in those sectors of the economy with a larger risk of expropriation, i.e., sectors characterized by large sunk costs, relatively low levels of firm specific know-how, and in sectors that are politically sensitive to foreign ownership. This paper represents the first attempt to empirically study the heterogeneous effect that BITs may have across different sectors of investments. We analyze investments made in 13 countries in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, disaggregated over seven sectors. We indeed find the effect of BITs to differ considerably across sectors of investment. Using capital intensity as a proxy, we confirm that FDI in those sectors with higher sunk costs responds more strongly to the signing of BITs. Given the considerable differences in the development impact that can be expected from FDI in different sectors, it remains to be shown whether BITs are an effective tool to attract those types of investments that are most beneficial for the development of the host economy.

We implement a two-stage least squares estimation: the first-stage instruments mark-ups, a financial measure of rents, with barriers to entry and the second stage estimates the impact of instrumented mark-ups on total factor productivity (TFP), a real measure of firm efficiency. We find that entry barriers lower firm productivity by raising mark-ups and rents. These estimates imply that, if French and Italian regulators had adopted the OECD best practices in terms of entry barriers, firms in these sectors would have increased their TFP level by five percentage points.

This article tests this proposition exploiting an exogenous shock in diversity due to Germany's reunification. In contrast to previous work on ethno-linguistic or racial heterogeneity, we specifically analyze religious diversity, which is an increasingly relevant social cleavage in many countries. Our main results corroborate that increasing religious diversity leads to a change in fiscal policies in Bavarian municipalities over the 1983-2005 period. Moreover, we find some evidence of declining individual-level local identification over the post-reunification period, which suggests that the observed fiscal effects are indeed linked to the theoretical mechanism of individuals' social identification. Finally, we highlight an important mediating role for the democratic process, since the observed fiscal effects strengthen considerably following Bavarian municipalities' first local elections after the reunification migration wave (March 1996) and a legal change allowing local referenda on public policies (October 1995).

The magnitude for the tax response of reported profits doubles the effects found in previous studies for non-financial MNCs. Additional analysis reveals that the response to tax incentives differs across business types.

I use both the equilibrium and disequilibrium econometric frameworks, specifically tackling the issue of lack of consistency and/or efficiency of joint estimators in the former via the three-stage least squares technique. On the demand side, I find that higher economic activity provides stimulus to credit whereas inflation dampens it. The stock market seems to play a dual role: as a source of alternative financing, a bullish market negatively impacts credit while, as an indicator of economic expectations, it provides a positive impetus. On the supply side, banks' lending capacity is found to be the major driver of credit while government borrowing has a crowding-out effect. Pakistan currently faces supply constraints, which might put an additional check on capacity utilization by firms, thus damaging growth prospects. The results have important policy implications.","[Ahmed, Jameel] State Bank Pakistan, Monetary Policy Dept, II Chundrigar Rd, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Ahmed, J (通讯作者)，State Bank Pakistan, Monetary Policy Dept, II Chundrigar Rd, Karachi, Pakistan.",Jamil.Khilji@sbp.org.pk,"Ahmed, Jameel/ABC-9250-2021","Ahmed, Jameel/0000-0002-6816-5640",,,,,47,3,4,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Multiple strategies including green technologies, transport management, urban planning and behavior changes are required to mitigate transport emissions. This paper aims to introduce an analytical framework to investigate the impacts of different spatial-modal strategies on reducing commuting emissions. Based on the optimization approach of excess commuting, the proposed framework incorporates the minimum, maximum and random (unpredictable) travel outcomes to inform planning of an urban form embedded with fewer emissions. This analytical framework is applied to Hong Kong to estimate the emissions ranges (the minimum and maximum amounts) under 42 spatial-modal scenarios - a combination of six spatial strategies (status quo, monocentric, highly polycentric, moderately polycentric, dual-centric and tri-centric) and seven modal strategies (status quo, pro-rail (high), pro-rail (moderate), pro bus (high), pro-bus (moderate), pro-car (high) and pro-car (moderate)). The findings illustrate the emissions impacts if Hong Kong is further developed following a job concentration or decentralization principle. It also indicates that if Hong Kong is reconstructed to be a city with multiple CBDs, a dual-centric strategy is desirable because both minimum and maximum commuting are shorter than that of a tri-centric strategy. Moreover, the modal strategy to actively promote rail usage shows more impacts on emissions reduction and car usage should be maintained at the current level. If commuter's travl is less predictable, the high rail usage under a dual-centric city form is a more sustainable spatial-modal strategy. The proposed analytical framework of city's commuting emissions affected by structural and modal changes is transferrable to other places and could offer planners different benchmarks of travel pattern to substantiate their sustainable city planning vision.

In particular there is little work on the interaction between corruption, government expenditures and how this influences economic growth in countries in the region. This paper takes an endogenous growth model, extends it to include different categories of government spending and then introduces the possibility of corruption, which is allowed to have different effects on each of the categories. The results confirm the negative effect of corruption and military spending, but also show that corruption interacts with military burden, through indirect and complementary effects, to further increase its negative effect. The policy implications are that the effects of corruption on economic growth are worse than was thought in countries which have high military burdens. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Though seemingly mobility investments, the intended impacts of these streetcar projects reach beyond transportation and represent a strong turn toward strategic spatial planning through transportation infrastructure. Proponents of modem streetcars argue that they are tools of placemaking as much as if not more than improvements for transit services. Unlike transit investments of a century ago, when privately operated streetcars were a decentralizing force that helped disperse overcrowded central city cores and open new land for real estate development, current streetcar projects in the United States are expected to concentrate activity and economic development in select corridors. The majority of these new systems rely on transit technologies that are significantly improved over the carriages of old, with modern features, smooth rides and quiet operations. Yet for all the improvements to the vehicles and services, new streetcar investments no longer primarily improve transit accessibility. Rather, modem streetcars are part of strategic amenity packages cities use to achieve real estate and economic development goals. This use of transportation infrastructure as an amenity for a particular location is a shift away from traditional transportation planning processes, and the expected benefits, in particular, stand apart as being deliberately spatial. We use planning documents and data from ballot box initiatives to evaluate expected transportation benefits relative to indirect benefits through economic development. We find that approximately three-quarters of all expected benefits from streetcar projects accrue to property development with the remaining expected benefits assigned to transportation. However, we do not find sufficient empirical evidence in the literature to support such certain claims of positive effects on property values and the built environment. We argue that the increasing tendency of cities to leverage streetcar projects for non-transportation purposes represents a turn to the use of infrastructure as a tool of spatial planning.

Why, for example, have some equally poor, indigenous, highland communities in Guatemala made advances in health and education while others have stagnated or regressed? This paper argues that, contrary to an emerging recognition of the role of ordinary citizens in peacebuilding or crime reduction, human development requires the complementarity of non-state leaders and government resources. Results are demonstrated through a quantitative analysis of all of Guatemala's 334 municipalities, combined with a qualitative analysis, including over 250 key informant interviews and focus group participants from four paired communities throughout the Western Highlands, which effectively traces the implementation of a widely acclaimed government anti-hunger program. This paper underscores the variability in local governance present across short distances in Guatemala, with dramatic influence on local development outcomes. In most communities, the role of traditional leaders and other non-state actors is increasingly crowded out by political conflicts exacerbated by growing, and shifting political party and religious affiliations. In these instances, development governance has broken down and development resources are distributed along locally derived lines of patronage versus need. Elsewhere, however, where state actors have identified and incorporated the legitimacy, informal authority, and networks of traditional leaders at the village level, the implementation of the anti-hunger program is visibly more effective. The role of local, informal leaders is pivotal in legitimizing the program, mobilizing citizen participation, and overseeing more equitable distribution of key resources. The paper concludes with an exploration of what explains variation in the quality of local governance across space and its implications for development practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper exploits a natural experiment from the 18th century in which information flows were regularly interrupted for exogenous reasons. English shares were traded on the Amsterdam exchange and news came in on sailboats that were often delayed because of adverse weather conditions. The paper documents that prices responded strongly to boat arrivals, but there was considerable volatility in the absence of news. The evidence suggests that this was largely the result of the revelation of (long-lived) private information and the (transitory) impact of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries' risk premia.","[Koudijs, Peter] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Koudijs, Peter] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Koudijs, P (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Koudijs, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Koudijs, Peter/0000-0002-9889-2996",,,,,98,28,39,3,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Aiming at capturing the subjective element of accessibility, as opposed to conventional accessibility that is based on the same objective attributes for large areas or groups of people, the authors developed and tested a measure of perceived accessibility; the four items self-reported Perceived Accessibility Scale (PAC). In study 1, 237 users of public transport rated PAC. The results showed that PAC is a reliable measure. The PAC was further validated and proved reliable in two waves (study 2) in altered conditions (Wave 1, N = 246, Wave 2, N = 259). Based on this, an overall PAC index was constructed. PAC can be used to determine the traveler's (or possible travelers) opinion of accessibility in transport planning or accessibility-mapping, or for directing interventions aimed at improving accessibility to where they are best needed according to the individuals. Further development of the PAC and its potential within transport research and planning, and its future validation is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This can lead to long-term positive outcomes or if resource exploitation is unsustainable-lose-lose outcomes that leave populations and ecosystems worse off. This paper introduces a dynamic model of resource exploitation to explain how regions may succumb to, avoid or escape this negative outcome. The theoretical model characterizes a frontier community that uses soil as an input into agricultural production. The model shows that there may be a critical point in the soil stock that determines whether agricultural activities lead to sustainable development or a collapse in local income. This suggests that, in the event of a resource collapse, temporary adjustments to the system may permanently rehabilitate the resource base and change a community's development pattern. Calibration of the model to several frontier states of the Brazilian Amazon points toward an overall outcome of steady development.","[Melstrom, Richard T.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Jones, Luke R.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Valdosta, GA USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University System of Georgia; Valdosta State University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Melstrom, RT (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;Jones, LR (通讯作者)，Valdosta State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Valdosta, GA USA.;Caviglia-Harris, J (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD USA.",melstrom@okstate.edu; lukjones@valdosta.edu; jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu,"Jones, Luke/GWQ-5302-2022","Caviglia-Harris, Jill/0000-0001-7860-4857; Melstrom, Richard/0000-0001-6420-5425; Jones, Luke/0000-0003-0436-0188",,,,,60,0,0,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Recent decades have brought a rise in container terminal development at estuarine, coastal and offshore port locations, in part driven by scale increases in vessel size. This paper examines how container ports located upstream on rivers use processes of adaptive capacity building in an attempt to remain competitive in port systems. We link the development path of upstream seaports to a range of economic, technological, social and political factors. When combined, these factors shape the willingness and capacity of an upstream seaport to adapt to changing conditions such as an increasing demand for nautical accessibility. The case study results on Antwerp and Hamburg show that the discussion on the future of these upstream seaports cannot be detached from broader public policy and stakeholder management concerns and the influences of retention mechanisms, power, politics and collective action by the port community.

It then examines the relationship between firms' export market diversification and their productivity by using trade and production data from the Customs Trade Statistics and the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms in China from the years 2000 to 2006. We check the robustness of the results by controlling for potential endogeneity and estimating various specifications. We find that there is a U-shaped relationship between the diversification of export markets and firm productivity. As firms begin to export, they face higher costs (and thus lower productivity) initially because they lack the knowledge and experience. Eventually, as diversification of the export market moves beyond a threshold level and investments cumulate, export market expansion results in lower long-run average costs and thus higher productivity owing to the learning curve and economies of scope, as well as economies of scale. This U-shaped relationship, however, is less pronounced for firms with higher share of intermediate products in total exports, for firms engaged in processing trade, and for firms exporting to Hong Kong. The results have significant implications for firm export dynamics and behavior, and can help target policies that will boost the performance of the firms. They are significant for policy makers who have emphasized the importance of export diversification for mitigating the impact of global shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We postulate that the perceived negative IVOL-expected return relation could be the artifact of the confounding effect of public news arrivals. Using the stock return data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database and the news database from the RavenPack News Analytics over the period from 2000 to 2011, we show that the strength of the positive relation is reduced systematically by 50% after accounting for the arrivals of good and bad news releases, which are defined by their sentiment scores. This finding is robust to numerous model specifications, and the inclusion of firm-level characteristics, liquidity risk and information risk. When we restrict the firm specific news to value-relevant news, the positive relation disappears. We conclude that that the public arrivals of firm-specific news play a significant role in explaining the IVOL puzzle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To test this hypothesis, we exploit a rich panel dataset, displaying a representative picture of bilateral migration flows and climatic data across 222 countries for the period 1960-2000. Findings suggest that in the next few years the climate-induced growth rate of migrant stocks might be in a range between 8.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent, especially from developing countries, where the level of rural employment is more likely to be affected by climatic shocks.","[Maurel, Mathilde] Univ Paris 01, UMR 8174, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Maurel, Mathilde] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Tuccio, Michele] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Southampton,"Tuccio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",m.tuccio@soton.ac.uk,"Maurel, Mathilde/AAN-2096-2021","Maurel, Mathilde/0000-0003-4543-4286",Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Maurel gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI) and the program Investissement d'Avenir (reference ANR-10-LABX-14-01) of the French government.,,58,38,41,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Some evidence indicates that aggressive earnings management carries over to aggressive management of capital structure in the form of higher leverage and aggressive management of working capital in the form of lower liquidity. Earnings management by banks is achieved instead by managing accruals dealing with payment behavior on loans: the loan loss provision and net charge-offs. A regulatory change expressed in the Basel III accords has tightened requirements on leverage and liquidity and could have affected earnings and capital management. This study examines the effect of leverage and liquidity on the behavior of earnings and capital management in U.S. commercial banks over the period from 1999 to 2013. If aggressive earnings management behavior carries over to aggressive leverage and liquidity policies, we should expect a negative relation between earnings management measures and capital measures and a negative relation between earnings management and liquidity measures. We show that earnings and capital management measures consistently have a significant positive relationship with capital ratios and a,significant negative relationship with liquidity ratios. These results suggest that regulators should be on guard for all forms of aggressive management behavior. In the post crisis period, our results also show evidence of additional regulatory scrutiny with a significant positive relation between liquidity and earnings management, which could indicate that less liquid banks are prevented from engaging in earnings management by regulators.

While forward implied volatility can also be traded with forward-start strangles, this study demonstrates that VIX futures could offer more effective volatility-risk hedge for an investor who has a short position on the S&P 500 futures call option. In particular, the delta-vega-neutral hedging strategy incorporating stochastic volatility on average outperforms in out-of-sample hedging. Adding price jumps further enhances the hedging performance during the crash period.

This paper examines how the valuation of ecosystem services and ecosystem assets can be undertaken in an integrated national accounting setting. We clarify the relevant valuation principles, most significantly the need to apply the concept of exchange values, and explain why the integration of ecosystem services necessitates an extension of the standard production boundary used in economic measurement. The main implications of an accounting approach are discussed including the need to distinguish benefits from services, the need for valuation methods that exclude consumer surplus, and the importance of aligning measures of income and degradation. Remaining challenges include the treatment of low or negative rents, accounting for ecosystem disservices, and the derivation of values for ecosystem assets. Meeting these challenges and advancing work in this area should be the joint focus of economists, ecologists and accountants.","[Obst, Carl] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Monash Rd, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hein, Lars] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Edens, Bram] Stat Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands",University of Melbourne; Wageningen University & Research,"Obst, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Monash Rd, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",cobst@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,68,98,114,5,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It first demonstrates that free entry of domestic firms is always socially excessive irrespective of the policy regimes rate in an open economy. It then shows that optimal tariff rate and output subsidy rate under free entry of domestic firms will be lower than the one at regulated entry when the scale of domestic market is moderate; for dual policy regime, the optimal output subsidy rate at free entry is lower than the one at regulated entry, while the optimal tariff rate at free entry is higher than the one at regulated entry. Furthermore, even though the need of dual policy for welfare improvement is degenerate to be suboptimal with the free entry of domestic firms, but it is still superior to the subsidy policy.

We show that under certain conditions, the realized risk of the optimal minimum variance portfolio (MVP) obtained from the strategy can asymptotically be lower than those of benchmark portfolios with a high probability. Our theoretical results imply that penalty parameters for the weighted-norm penalty can be specified as a simple function of the number of assets and sample size. With the theoretical results, we also develop an automatic calibration procedure for choosing the penalty parameters. We demonstrate superior OOS performances of the weighted-norm MVP with two real data sets. Finally, we propose several alternative norm penalties and show that their OOS performances are comparable to the weighted-norm strategy.","[Yen, Yu-Min] Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Yen, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,33,19,24,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Using a survey fielded in the RAND American Life Panel, this paper provides empirical evidence on possible deviation from risk neutrality with respect to longevity in the US population. The questions we ask allow to find the distribution as well as to quantify the degree of risk aversion with respect to the length of life in the population. We find evidence that roughly 75% of respondents were not neutral with respect to longevity risk. Hence, there is a little empirical support for the joint use of the expected utility and additive lifetime utility assumptions in life-cycle models. Higher income households are more likely to be risk averse towards the length of life. We do not find evidence that the degree of risk aversion varies with age or education.","[Delprat, G.; Leroux, M. -L.; Michaud, P. -C.] ESG UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, M. -L.] CESifo, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, M. -L.] CORE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, M. -L.; Michaud, P. -C.] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Leroux, M. -L.; Michaud, P. -C.] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Michaud, P. -C.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; RAND Corporation,"Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，ESG UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，CESifo, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，CORE, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",leroux.marielouise@uqam.ca,"Michaud, Pierre Carl/AAA-2357-2021","Michaud, Pierre-Carl/0000-0003-3114-4229",RAND Roybal Center; Industrielle Alliance Research Chair on Economics of Demographic Change,RAND Roybal Center; Industrielle Alliance Research Chair on Economics of Demographic Change,"We acknowledge financial support from the RAND Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making, the Industrielle Alliance Research Chair on the Economics of Demographic Change and thank the RAND ALP survey team for fielding our questions.

There are four key findings. First, audit adjustments cause earnings to become smoother and more persistent. Second, the adjustments result in higher accrual quality. Third, audit adjustments have a larger negative effect on signed accruals than absolute accruals. Fourth, the adjustments do not reduce the discontinuity in the earnings distribution around zero.

Attempts to stimulate such action through central direction and explicit planning such as embodied in a National Systems of Innovation approach are inherently limiting because of an inability to anticipate future actions and consequences. A more fruitful approach is the one embodied in a National Systems of Entrepreneurship (NSE) approach, one that recognizes the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial process and focuses instead on the promulgation of policies through public-sector entrepreneurship to create a more nurturing environment within which entrepreneurial action can spontaneously arise in both the private and the public sectors. This paper develops an NSE-based theoretical model of the entrepreneurial environment that integrates into a functional whole the various subsets of that environment that others have studied and explores the role that NSE-guided public policy can play in improving the entrepreneurial environment for both private-sector and public-sector entrepreneurs. In the private sector, such public policies would focus on enhancing the creative environment, the exchange environment, the incentive and feedback structures, and the access to resources. It is also possible to enhance the entrepreneurial environment in the public sector, though the competing demands of democratic norms make that enhancement more difficult.","[Leyden, Dennis Patrick] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, POB 26165, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Leyden, DP (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, POB 26165, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.",dpleyden@uncg.edu,"Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022",,,,,,31,53,63,2,73,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Greater takeover pressure makes PIPE issuers more likely to grant investors large blocks of shares, price discounts, generous dividends, and board seats. Takeover pressure also encourages issuers to place more shares with friendly investors such as managerial investors and strategic alliance investors. The evidence is consistent with the regular methods of the white squire defense. PIPEs can be a preferred method in the choice of a white squire defense when poorly performing and highly overleveraged firms face severe takeover pressure. There is a negative relation between takeover probability and post-issue performance of issuers, which supports the managerial entrenchment hypothesis over the shareholder interest hypothesis. Therefore PIPEs can increase, not mitigate, agency problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has argued in favor of the hypothesis that a combination of mental accounting and prospect theory can explain why annuities containing a capital guarantee are preferred to standard annuities. However, from this perspective people would not annuitize their assets at all, but rather invest the money in a risk-free alternative. Recent research has also suggested a cushion effect. When all possible outcomes of two options are above a certain goal, this goal serves as a cushion in case of unfavorable outcomes. Hence, individuals might have a higher propensity to exhibit risk-seeking behavior. We find that individuals were indeed more willing to choose the annuity option if it contained a capital guarantee and that individuals using this guarantee as a cushion were even more willing to choose the annuity. Thus, the cushion effect can partially explain the high demand for guarantee features in annuity contracts.",,,,knoller@bwl.lmu.de,,,program LMUexcellent,program LMUexcellent,"Christian Knoller is member of the Munich Risk and Insurance Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munich, SchackstraBe 4/III, 80539 Munich, Germany.

Optimal exploitation has nonlinear responses to the price signal and should be conservative at low levels of biological stochasticity and aggressive at high levels. Price stochasticity induces conservative exploitation with little or no biological uncertainty, but has no strong effect when the biological uncertainty is larger. We further observe that resource exploitation should be conservative when the price reverts slowly to the mean. Simulations show that, in the long run, both the stock level and the exploitation rate are lower than in the deterministic solution. With a harvest-dependent price, the long-run price is higher in the stochastic system. The price mean reversion rate has no influence on the long-run solutions.","[Kvamsdal, Sturla Furunes] NHH, SNF Ctr Appl Res, Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Poudel, Diwakar; Sandal, Leif Kristoffer] NHH, Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Kvamsdal, SF (通讯作者)，NHH, SNF Ctr Appl Res, Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",sturla.kvamsdal@nhh.no; diwakar.poudel@nhh.no; leif.sandal@nhh.no,"Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/W-3702-2019","Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/0000-0002-5384-0316","Research Council of Norway [196433/S40, 216571/E40, 234238/E40]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We want to thank Rognvaldur Hannesson, Stein Ivar Steinshamn, co-editor David Finnoff, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

The existing literature seems to lack any effort to use a nationally representative data from the United States, to properly address endogeneity, or to examine educational outcomes beyond high school level. This paper attempts to mitigate these shortcomings. Drawing upon the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, it first used OLS and logit regression. It then applied the maximum simulated likelihood approach to get rid of endogeneity, thereby isolating the causal impact of parenting style on children's educational outcomes. Findings suggested that parenting style mattered for children academic performance. Authoritative parenting style was found to be the best among all types of parenting style. Particularly, relative to uninvolved parents' children, authoritatively reared children were predicted to have 1.1 more years of schooling and be 18.5, 13.6, and 16.3 percentage points more likely to obtain at least bachelor's degree, associate's degree, and high school diploma, respectively. Also, they had 5.5 percentage points less likelihood of being high school dropouts than children reared by uninvolved parents.","[Majumder, Md.

The impact of the first round of QE policy is related to Thailand's export market exposures, trade, and financial linkages with the United States and Japan. In the short run, QE has either an expansionary or contractionary effect on Thailand's output depending on whether the baht depreciates or appreciates against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. In the long run, when QE stimulates world output expansion, Thailand's manufactured output and exports respond positively to world economic recovery. In the medium run, the impact of QE is related to the appreciation of the Chinese yuan and the slowing of the Chinese economy, which further depresses Thailand's exports and prolongs Thailand's output recovery.","[Nidhiprabha, Bhanupong] Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Nidhiprabha, B (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",bhanupong@econ.tu.ac.th,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We observe the degree to which a firm has an overlapping distribution of economic centers in comparison to industry competitors and suggest that geographically similar firms have lower information gathering costs and thereby more precise earnings forecasts. Empirical evidence supports this prediction. We further find that the geographic dispersion across the U.S. is less likely to affect forecast precision when a firm has economic activities in states with highly correlated local shocks. Our findings suggest that the effect of geographic dispersion is more pronounced for soft-information environments where information is more difficult to make impersonal by using technological advances. Consistent with the information asymmetry argument, we find that geographically dispersed firms have less comparable and more discretionary managed earnings, have less extensive than industry competitors segment information, are more likely to restate sale segment information, and issue annual and quarterly filings with a delay.

We derive the households' marginal willingness to pay using the intuitive idea that the length of the queue for a specific house reflects the households' willingness to pay for housing characteristics. We apply our methodology to public housing in the Amsterdam Metropolitan area and show that, on average, the households' marginal willingness to pay for a unit of public housing is close to its marginal costs. This suggests that the welfare loss of public housing through distortions in housing supply is rather limited and is mainly through distortions in housing demand. We provide indirect evidence of the latter by showing that queueing induces inefficient matching of households and housing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate the model jointly on the self-employed and salaried employees in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Unlike most previous studies, we find that college does not increase business survival. By contrast, a college degree significantly increases employment survival. Cognitive skills have a positive impact on survival for both the self-employed and employees. These findings suggest that college benefits the self-employed less than salaried, perhaps by generating skills more useful in employment than self-employment, or because of differences in the value of signaling.","[Asoni, Andrea] Charles River Associates Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Asoni, Andrea] IFN Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sanandaji, Tino] Inst Econ & Business Hist Res EHFF, Stockholm, Sweden",Charles River Associates; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Asoni, A (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, Washington, DC USA.",asoni@uchicago.edu,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"We thank Luigi Zingales, Erik G.

We argue that there could exist an inverted-U curve in terms of export spillover effect, resulting from the fact that once exporters become over-agglomerated, export congestion is likely to cause negative export spillover. The estimation results support the hypothesis of an inverted-U curve of export spillover effect. Further calculation shows that the degree of Chinese exporters' congestion approximately ranges around 17-34% and demonstrates an increasing trend over time. The finding suggests that policies aimed at reducing export congestion such as industrial upgrading, improvement of firms' efficiency and the current shift from export dependence towards domestic demand would be important for a more healthy development of China's exports in the future.","[Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Bao, Qun] Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Ye, Ninghua] Xiamen Univ, Dept Int Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Nankai University; Xiamen University,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",ligang.song@anu.edu.au,,"Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",Chinese Natural Science Fund [71473136]; Huo Yingdong Fund [141083]; Younger Excellent Scholarship [NCET-11-0248]; Rio Tinto-ANU China; Rio Tinto-ANU China Partnership,Chinese Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Huo Yingdong Fund; Younger Excellent Scholarship; Rio Tinto-ANU China; Rio Tinto-ANU China Partnership,"Bao acknowledges the financial support from Chinese Natural Science Fund (Grant No. 71473136), Huo Yingdong Fund (Grant No. 141083) and Younger Excellent Scholarship (Grant No. NCET-11-0248).

The most popular explanation for this phenomenon is the prevalence of son preference. However, empirical findings indicate that the assumption of a positive relationship between wanted daughters and female children's survival is not found in every scenario, and it does not have a clear explanation in the literature. To fill this gap, we present a simple model that provides insights into how the positive marginal effect of wanted daughters on their survival might decrease with higher societal discrimination against young females. The model draws on the emerging literature that examines the erosion of cognitive and noncognitive skills that results from poverty and discrimination. Our theoretical findings are tested for the case of India, using the third round of the National Family Health Survey, with Zero-Inflated Poisson models. Our estimates provide support for the interaction of parents' preferences and societal discrimination against female children. In particular, we show that the statistical significance of the marginal effect of wanted daughters on their survival disappears in contexts of high societal discrimination against female children. Our study contributes to the literature by questioning the commonly held assumption of additive separability between the effect of family and societal characteristics. One central implication is that the alleviation of poverty alone might fail to automatically reduce sex-based discriminatory practices, and that multidimensional interventions are required that target the individual and society.

By instrumenting the relative size of the mining sector with the natural geological variation in countries' fossil fuel endowments, I provide evidence suggestive of a causal relationship. The findings suggest that countries with larger mining shares tend to have poorer health and education outcomes than countries with similar per capita incomes, geographic characteristics, and institutional quality. Doubling the mining share of an economy corresponds to, on average, the infant death rate being 20% higher, life expectancy being 5% lower, total years of education being 20% lower, and 70% more people having no formal education. Divergences from the Preston curve-the concave relationship between cross-country income and life expectancy that has long been of interest to economists, demographers, and epidemiologists are thus partly explained by the size of the mining sector. Within-country evidence from Indonesia paints a similar picture. My results provide support for a growing body of evidence linking mining to poorer average living standards, particularly vis-a-vis other types of income. I also estimate the effects of national mining dependence on non-mining income, health and education investment, and institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide new evidence linking the CIV factor to income risk faced by households. Our findings are consistent with an incomplete markets heterogeneous agent model. In the model, CIV is a priced state variable because an increase in idiosyncratic firm volatility raises the average household's marginal utility.

It begins with a collection of stylized facts related to commodities based on household survey data from Latin America and Africa. The data uncovers strong commodity dependence on both regions: households typically allocate a large fraction of their budget to commodities, and they often also depend on commodities to earn their income. This income and expenditure dependency suggests sizable impacts and adjustments following commodity price shocks. The article explores these effects with a review of the relevant literature. The authors study consumption and income responses, labor market responses, and spillovers across sectors.

Accompanying this rapid growth in national accounts have been rapid and widespread reductions in poverty. With these reductions in poverty, however, there has often been observed an increase in income inequality, both between as well as within rural and urban sectors. This rising income gap challenges the notion that economic reforms in China have been as successful as the poverty statistics would suggest. In this paper, we suggest that an alternative view would be to consider the effects of these reforms on changing the chronic nature of poverty and reducing household vulnerability to poverty. Using a balanced panel from rural China from 1991 through 2006, we find that most poverty among our sample has shifted from being chronic in nature to being transient, with households either shifting into a state of being non-poor moving in and out of poverty. Among our sample, vulnerability to poverty has been declining over time, but the declines are not uniform over time or space. We decompose household vulnerability status into two proximate causes: low expected income and high income variability, finding vulnerability increasingly due to income variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that vulnerable households have very different characteristics than non-vulnerable households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In conclusion, it is uncovered that for the most part buyers trust word of mouth. Moreover, results show two things that can demotivate the purchasing of certain products: an intense experience of any item/benefit and negative verbal remarks. Customers today are influenced by word of mouth.

The probability of share repurchases that increase earnings per share (EPS) is sharply higher for firms that would have just missed the EPS forecast in the absence of the repurchase, when compared with firms that just beat the EPS forecast. We use this discontinuity to show that EPS-motivated repurchases are associated with reductions in employment and investment, and a decrease in cash holdings. Our evidence suggests that managers are willing to trade off investments and employment for stock repurchases that allow them to meet analyst EPS forecasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Primary data were collected in the period from May to July 2015 at urban farmer's markets located in cities with a population greater than 100,000 in the Czech Republic. Questionnaires were distributed personally to customers and also producers/vendors and involved also interactions between these groups at farmers' markets. The level of personal assistance, dedicated personal assistance, self-service, automated services, communities and co-creation were assessed. The results show that in the customer relations further possible improvements of Value Proposition of farmers' markets with the customer segment can be found. The results suggest that the most used type of customer relationship is personal assistance, but customers perceive the ability not only buying food from farmers at the market but also experience, which provides space for other types of customer relations: such as dedicated personal assistance, automated services and communities.","[Balcarova, Tereza; Pilar, Ladislav; Pokorna, Jitka; Ticha, Ivana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Balcarová, T (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",pilarl@pef.czu.cz; balcarovat@pef.czu.cz; pokorna@pef.czu.cz; ticha@pef.czu.cz,"Pilař, Ladislav/C-9172-2017; Ticha, Ivana/C-5460-2017; Balcarova, Tereza/N-4869-2017","Pilař, Ladislav/0000-0001-7624-7323; Ticha, Ivana/0000-0003-4000-1000; Balcarova, Tereza/0000-0003-0263-0076",,,,,25,5,5,1,13,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,27,33,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000003,0

The increased proportion of IIT in matched two-way agri-food trade of the EU-27 member states is consistent with economic integration and economic growth. When export prices were at least 15% higher than the import prices, high-vertical IIT, increased for most member states. This finding suggests that quality improvements occurred when comparing agri-food exports to similar imports of agri-food products. The IIT indices for both horizontal and vertical IIT are positively associated with higher economic development levels, new EU membership and EU enlargement. Additionally, as higher levels of economic development decreases, the size of the economy and marginal IIT increases the effects of agri-food trade liberalization on the costs of the labor market adjustment. Understanding how improvements in agri-food trade quality impact agribusiness and managerial competitiveness reveal significant policy implications.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi U 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Kaposvar Univ, Guba Sandor U 40, H-7400 Kaposvar, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Kaposvar University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Corvinus University Budapest,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; ferto.imre@krtk.mta.hu,"Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",European Community [312029]; Economic crises and international agricultural trade [NKFI-115788],European Community; Economic crises and international agricultural trade,"This paper was generated as part of the COMPETE Project, Grant Agreement No. 312029 (http://www.compete-project.eu/), with the financial support from the European Community under the 7th Framework Program, the bilateral projects between Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the project: NKFI-115788 Economic crises and international agricultural trade.

Emissions rate performance standards are the metric identified for regulation of the electricity sector, the most important source of emissions. Rates for existing sources could be averaged to achieve flexibility in compliance, although the stringency of policies is ambiguous when flexibility is introduced. For example, a specific emissions rate improvement averaged over a larger set of generators may reduce the actual emissions change. We evaluate three policy designs according to emissions rate, emissions and marginal cost and show how a marginal abatement cost criterion can be applied within a technology-based regulation. This approach can quadruple the emissions reductions that are achieved, with net social benefits exceeding $25 billion in 2020, and with a 1.3 % electricity price increase.

Our study mitigates some of these problems using a research design that relates changes in investment-cash flow sensitivity to changes in the bid-ask spread measure of information asymmetry surrounding (i) implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and (ii) deregulation of firms in the Transportation, Telecommunication, and Petroleum and Natural Gas industries. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that information asymmetry decreases following SOX and that there is a corresponding decrease in the investment-cash flow sensitivity, pre-to post-SOX. Further, greater decreases in information asymmetry following SOX are associated with greater decreases in investment-cash flow sensitivity. The results for the deregulation sample are also consistent with our hypothesis, wherein we observe an increase in information asymmetry and corresponding increase in the investment-cash flow sensitivity following deregulation.

The proof of the Internet's and the new informational technologies' importance in the tourism activity is that the World Economic Forum included the IT&C (The Information and Communications Technology) component among the 14 basic pillars of the Tourism Competitiveness Index. Under these circumstances, this research paper aims at analyzing comparatively the online visibility of the hotels from the Romanian seaside with that of the hotels situated on the seaside of the neighboring country, Bulgaria. The reasons for selecting the two countries were that both Romania and Bulgaria have many economic, geopolitical or historical similarities. Despite these similitudes, in the last two decades, the seaside tourism from the two countries had divergent evolution. Presuming that one of the determiners of the lower competitiveness and, implicitly, the lower conversion of tourists that the hotels on the Romanian seaside have in comparison with the hotels from the Bulgarian seaside is represented by the minimization of the Internet as a tourism promotion and communication environment, we considered appropriate an analysis through which we followed the familiarization of the hotels situated in these resorts with the latest terms, techniques and strategies specific to the virtual environment. We found that in terms of visibility and communication in the online environment, the hotels on the Romanian seaside have many strategic and organizational deficiencies, in comparison with similar hotels from the Bulgarian seaside.","[Costea, Mihai; Hapenciuc, Cristian-Valentin; Arionesei, Gabriela] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Costea, M (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania.",mihai_costeaa@yahoo.com; valentinh@seap.usv.ro; gabriela.arionesei@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,234,247,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300018,0

This data is augmented with regional characteristics obtained from Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) and with investment risk index of the Analytical center 'Expert'. To observe the effect of human capital on enterprise productivity, wage is chosen as a proxy of human capital quality. Human capital is also associated with agglomeration levels, i.e. concentration of economic activity in cities and regions. Indeed, from the enterprise point of view, agglomeration of economic activities leads to better matching on the labour market, input sharing and knowledge spillovers. Agglomeration levels are subdivided into localization and diversity (urbanization) levels. We control for regional business climate and transport infrastructure, and take into account specific features of different types of firms. Panel data allows us to deal with endogeneity biases using fixed effects. These biases occur for two major reasons: unobserved heterogeneity, when unobserved factors affect both enterprise revenue and explanatory variables, and simultaneity that arises due to productivity shocks, or if firms choose their location considering potential benefits or loses from agglomeration, for example. Our results show that the effect of average regional wage on enterprise productivity is positive. Besides, we find that Russian firms benefit from localization and diversity economies in cities, as well as from home market potential, and that these benefits vary across types of firms. In line with intuition, business risk is found to produce negative effect on enterprise performance. The results emphasize importance of economic policy aimed at development of human capital; results also show that if a sufficiently large number of firms work in a city, performance of each firm improves.","[Davidson, Natalia; Mariev, Oleg] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Davidson, N (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",natalya.davidson@gmail.com; o.s.mariev@urfu.ru,"Mariev, Oleg/G-7427-2015","Mariev, Oleg/0000-0002-9745-8434",Russian Science Foundation [15-18-10014],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"Research support from Russian Science Foundation for project No15-18-10014 Projection of optimal socioeconomic systems in turbulence of external and internal environment is gratefully acknowledged.

Problems with the transportation system have led to an increase in fertilizer transportation costs and a disproportionate increase in fertilizer's share of total agricultural production costs, highlighting the need to discover the most economic fertilizer transportation routes. Our research found a significant variance in fertilizer transportation costs among different Brazilian transport regions, referred to as transport corridors in this study. Literature on the subject has found that regional fertilizer shipping price variations are often contingent on the presence of shipping intensive industries, ports and storage centers. Using a comparative analysis based on an econometric model, this study examines the effect of intra-regional fertilizer transportation routes on shipping costs and clarifies the dynamics of fertilizer transport in Brazil.","[de Lima, Lilian M.] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, 11 Ave, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Elias, Lilian de Pelegrini; Coleti, Jamile de Campos] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Econ Inst IE, Econ Dev, Pitagoras St 353, BR-13083857 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Caixeta-Filho, Jose V.] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, ESALQ LOG Coordinat, 11 Ave, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Caixeta, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, ESALQ LOG Coordinat, 11 Ave, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",jose.caixeta@usp.br,"Elias, Lilian/CAF-2420-2022; Caixeta-Filho, José Vicente/H-5576-2012; Lima, Lilian/GYI-9292-2022; Coleti, Jamile C/M-2712-2016; Lima, Lilian/C-2502-2015","Caixeta-Filho, José Vicente/0000-0001-8289-9731; Lima, Lilian/0000-0002-6435-8496; Lima, Lilian/0000-0002-2256-7302",,,,,43,3,4,1,12,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This agreement is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, also known as Barcelona Process, launched by the EU in November 1995 and aimed, in the economic aspect, the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean. The implementation of this agreement, signed in Valencia (Spain) in April 2002, is the first step for Algeria towards a wide and varied program of restructurings to integrate the European market. Except that, the achievement of this objective has a significant financial cost, which will weigh on the general macroeconomic balances, following the lifting of tariffs, on one side, and the weakness of the services responsible for tax collection, on the other hand. Algeria may, against part of its commitment to this program, by eligible for the aid offered by the European part under the provisions of this agreement and other windfalls arising from the restructuring of financial institutions responsible for tax collection. Indeed, the MEDA program, the acronym of adjustment measures, which is a financial instrument for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and through which the EU is supposed to provide financial and technical assistance to the Mediterranean partners, including Algeria, to allow them to achieve the objectives of the Barcelona declaration in these three areas: political, economic and social. Thus, the new program (MEDA) replaces the bilateral financial protocols that previously existed with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and encourages the EU partners for the establishment of an economic environment, favorable to the requirements of the transition in these countries. Certainly, the EU remains the main partner in trade of Algeria. Thus, the situation is rather mixed since the implementation of the Association Agreement has no impact on the level and diversification of Algerian non-hydrocarbon exports to the EU countries, because Algeria wanted, through the implementation of the Association agreement, to achieve a diversification of the Algerian economy to allow the development of non-oil exports. The results being below the expectations of Algeria, informal consultations for the revision of tariff dismantling took place between the both parts. The purpose of these consultations is to postpone the deadline for the implementation of the free trade area in 2020 instead of 2017 and to provide the recovery of customs duties, according to the provisions planned by the agreement of association for a list of sensitive products.","[Debbihi, Abdelmalek; Mouhoub, Redouane] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 11 Tache Ionescu St, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Debbihi, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 11 Tache Ionescu St, Bucharest, Romania.",Malek2105@yahoo.fr; Malek2105@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,65,73,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300005,0

In the paper CSR is an important pillar of the change-management project with implications for entrepreneurial culture and business practice, on the one hand, entrepreneurial business innovation offers opportunities to CSR, on the other hand, sensitivity to CSR offers opportunities for entrepreneurial business innovation. Nowadays entrepreneurship and innovation are complementary because entrepreneurs implement inventions, their own or those of others; that is, they find ways to get the given invention to market by addressing issues of affordability, quality, durability, accessibility, etc., in a way that meets the needs of the customers in that market. Entrepreneurs with the CSR culture do the same thing for people facing social challenges and for the environment. The entrepreneurial culture is not a one-way street, something to be imposed upon people; it is based on the individual social responsibility (ISR). ISR is the propensity to take a personal stand to try and positively influence and affect the people and environment also outside their immediate circle. Companies comprise of individuals and determine the social responsibility culture; ISR is the base of the personal culture. ISR is capable of maintaining the balance between ethics and profitability that satisfies both the society and businesses (McDermott 2009) and help business to successfully continue. The importance of the role of personal values in an individual's decision-making and subsequent behavior was already studied but a gap in the literature exists for a connection of the ISR values of the entrepreneur with the entrepreneurship. Due to the insufficient attention is given to the role that personal values play in the application of the entrepreneurial decision in the context of CSR a qualitative approach to this problem is chosen. This paper highlights how CSR culture may act as drivers of the behavior and pays particular attention to the culture of the entrepreneur, thereby linking the existing debate on CSR with the field of entrepreneurship.","[Gazzola, Patrizia] Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Colombo, Gianluca] Univ Lugano, Via Buffi 13, Lugano, Switzerland",University of Insubria; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Gazzola, P (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it; gianluca.colombo@usi.ch,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,939,950,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300078,0

This systemic crisis has been the most severe among the recurring crises that have marked the age of global finance which had begun with the destruction of Bretton Woods. The current crisis led to a world-wide, near-meltdown of the financial and banking system, to the debt crisis and the Eurozone crisis. Contrary to the 1930s the worst has been avoided thanks to bold innovation and the successful cooperation among central banks, national governments and international organizations, and due to the break with policy orthodoxy. Yet, many of the excesses of globalization and of global finance still have to be corrected. Today, the world has to face the tasks of ending the artificially low (and even negative) interest rates and returning to a more market-conform interest rate structure without new financial turbulences as well as of overcoming the vicious circle of excessive debt and stagnation or slow growth. Both Europe and the world would be much worse off without the Euro. Strengthening the Eurozone requires cooperation, discipline and solidarity, not the creation of a European super state. In the long term, in order to restore sustained growth, social progress and economic and monetary stability, we also need a new rule-based global international monetary order. It is the responsibility of the main pillars of the liberal and democratic world economic order, Europe, the United States and Japan, to take the initiative and lead it to success.","[Hieronymi, Otto] Webster Univ, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Hieronymi, O (通讯作者)，Webster Univ, Geneva, Switzerland.",hieronymi@webster.ch,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-17413-6; 978-3-319-17412-9,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,3,18,,10.1007/978-3-319-17413-6_1,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000453295500001,0

It also attempts to identify the common and specific factors that influence these processes in different markets of the region. The indicators for the development of the aviation market were designed using, among other things, statistics describing the infrastructure facilities and the level of activity in the market. Composite indicators and the weights for their individual components were constructed using a Multidimensional Comparative Analysis. The conditions under which changes were taking place in Central and Eastern European Countries were described with the help of selected socio-economic panel data. Finally, One-Way Fixed Effects and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) models describing the development of the aviation markets were estimated. The adopted procedure made it possible to identify the most important common and specific factors that exerted the greatest influence on the situation of air transport in CEE Countries. The very initiation of the liberalisation process undoubtedly had a significantly beneficial effect on the development of route networks and aviation activities as broadly understood. However, the pace of change depended not only on the progress of liberalisation itself, but also on the diverse socio-economic conditions in the individual countries. As a result of the analysis, the markets were divided into two separate groups, which in many respects are distinctly different from each other. The results of the estimation models also showed that there are strong unobservable determinants of development which are specific to individual countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The TFP analysis covered the years 2009-2013. The study conducted was based on a Malmquist productivity index. The knowledge capital was approximated through investments in research and development in the years 2000 and 2008. Furthermore, the study included external benefits resulting from the R&D activities in other countries. In addition to the knowledge capital, the variables approximating human capital were accepted as determinants of TFP, i.e., the percentage of farm managers with full agricultural training and the percentage of farms managed by holders aged 55. The impact of knowledge and human capital on TFP was determined using a linear regression model. The results of the study indicate that the R&D expenditures incurred in the year 2000 are the stimulants of productivity growth, which confirms the assumption that there is a time lag between R&D and its benefits. Moreover, a positive effect on TFP growth was observed for the variable approximating human capital, i.e., the participation of farmers over the age of 55.","[Kijek, Tomasz; Nowak, Anna; Domanska, Katarzyna] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Kijek, T (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Fac Agrobioengn, Ul Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",tomasz.kijek@up.lublin.pl,"Kijek, Tomasz/U-2584-2018; Nowak, Anna/U-3646-2018","Kijek, Tomasz/0000-0002-0134-4943; Nowak, Anna/0000-0003-1741-8692",,,,,64,8,9,1,22,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In this contribution we have dealt with the localization of human capital of knowledge workers in today's world. The goal of this contribution is to prove that a part of human capital is moving from the traditional labor market to new places (to the virtual labor market, to coworking centers, often as freelancers), and employers must be able to use this human capital. Firms which are not able to adapt their management of human capital to the current trends will have an increasingly hard time acquiring talented employees. On the other hand, companies which are able to use human capital present on the virtual labor market have a competitive advantage. Technological development enables totally new ways of knowledge work, which satisfy the needs of mainly young knowledge workers better than traditional forms of employment. A significant part of knowledge work can be done using information and communication technologies, i.e. virtually. The virtual labor market is being developed and a lot of knowledge workers have made the decision to enter this market as freelancers. A special phenomenon of this time is a dynamic development of coworking centers worldwide (namely in those parts of the world where access to the Internet and other necessary infrastructure is available). At the same time, both dependent and independent virtual workers start concentrating in coworking centers, once the boom of home offices has faded away. In these centers they continue doing their normal work, but at the same time they can establish social contacts, which results in further development of social capital. In this contribution we have analyzed both trends: the development of the virtual labor market and coworking centers on the one hand, and opinions of Generation Z regarding their professional careers on the other. At this time Generation Z members are either entering the labor market once they have graduated from high school, or are starting their university studies. Data sources are both international studies performed earlier, and our own research dealing with the development of coworking and work needs of Generation Z in the Czech Republic. At the end of this contribution we have synthesized all the acquired information based on which we can assume that coworking centers will concentrate a significant amount of human capital. The total amount of available human capital might even grow since new ways of traditional knowledge work enable the engagement of even those, for whom it would be impossible to find traditional jobs due to various reasons. These findings are valuable both for companies employing such workers, and for knowledge workers themselves, since they may not be aware of the usefulness of their human capital, and also for universities preparing future employers as well as future knowledge workers.","[Kubatova, Jaroslava] Palacky Univ, Olomouc, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Kubátová, J (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",jaroslava.kubatova@upol.cz,,,,,,,18,4,4,0,18,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,145,151,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300018,0

Frequently applied on various economic issues, Pareto efficiency decides on the optimal balance of resource distribution among economic agents. On the other hand, the current state of unequal distribution stimulates new economic researches to bring to light the relationship between market mechanism and observed inequality. The aim of the study is to provide a unique perspective on market-based inequalities which are derived from the self-preserving rationality of agents, and to prove that market mechanism inherently contains diverging forces. Additionally, it is showed that such divergences are not investigable by Pareto-optimization process; the process whose frequent misuse and misinterpretation obscures the general diverging drive of market mechanism and the process which may corrupt results of theoretical researches in the field.","[Maialeh, Robin] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Maialeh, R (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",robin.maialeh@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

What are less well understood, however, are the drivers that reallocate scarce human and physical resources across occupations and space, and without which agriculture and industrial development, and hence structural transformation, will stagnate. One such endogenous driver is entrepreneurship. This paper begins with the reappraisal of African agriculture and focus on the literature on entrepreneurship in Africa's structural transformation. Then a conceptual model to describe how entrepreneurship reallocates farmers out of agriculture into non-agricultural activities and locations is presented. Recent empirical evidence that is broadly consistent with this model is discussed.

However, Latin America took its own path of integration, appearing more significantly in the 1960s, further reinventing itself in the predominance of neoliberalism. Since the turn of century it dealt with a lot of criticism internally for a lack of sustainable and cohesive projects aimed at facing today's transformations in the international system and the insertion of external powers. The European integration is often referred to as a relevant example of an integration attempt.

Two important changes were the consolidation of the banking sector and the dramatic growth in nonbank financial intermediaries, which are much more susceptible than banks to liquidity risks because of a lack of deposit insurance. This article highlights that, although security broker-dealers, money market mutual funds, and issuers of asset-backed securities were not particularly important in the early 1990s, when the bank credit crunch occurred, they grew dramatically to become both major sources of financing and key elements in exacerbating the problems experienced during the recent financial crisis.","[Peek, Joe; Rosengren, Eric] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Peek, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",joe.peek@bos.frb.org; eric.rosengren@bos.frb.org,,,,,,,26,5,5,1,16,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4808-3,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Property Tax in Pakistan,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TAXATION; REFORM,"The idea that states seek to maximise their revenue collection has occupied a significant place in contemporary political economy analysis of taxation, and has helped us understand the history of state formation. It is, however, very much at variance with the daily experience of tax policy and practice. Governments are frequently revenue-sacrificers: they fail to use the functioning, legitimate tax collection systems they have available to actually collect much revenue. This paper details the case of property tax collection in Pakistan, and concludes that governments tend to maximise rule before they maximise revenue.","[Piracha, Mujtaba] Pakistan Adm Serv, Lahore, Pakistan; [Moore, Mick] Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",,"Moore, M (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",MickM@ids.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,9,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The scientific aim is to summarize and quantify the most often used keywords, terms and patterns of expression in competitiveness definitions, what explains the meaning, measurement and determinants of competitiveness. Methodology/methods Literature review resulted with altogether, chronologically 125 competitiveness definitions and concepts were allocated within the timeframe between1949-2013 were subdivided in country, regional, industry, firm/company and individual levels of research. Some authors have generated more than 1 definition, some definitions are published by more than 1 author, and some definitions cover 2 areas of competitiveness research in a definition. In the article were included only 34 most recent competitiveness definitions (1998-2013) and cited sources (due to page limit A. Appendix), as selection criteria was used: the most often applied words and terms in the content. Full list of competitiveness definitions will be included in further research articles and doctoral dissertation. Scientific aim Identify the most often used keywords and terms in competitiveness definitions and concepts, summary of main word meaning used to define competitiveness and factors at the given context and objective with the help of software. Findings 837 words were derived from definition content mentioned at least one time, if the word competitiveness is taken away from result list, then the top ten is as follows: 1st place country (mentioned 62 times); 2nd ability (57 times); 3rd products (56), 4th firm (45); 5th nations (39); 6th international (38); 7th markets (37); 8th economic (34); 9th level (31); 10th services (24),factors(23). Most often the scale of competitiveness is defined (country, company, markets or its synonyms), competitiveness is viewed as ability, provide or achieve (70 words), products and services (98) are important measure; factors, terms and conditions (52 words), finally very often researchers competitiveness associates with growth, increase, high and better (54 words), and it means welfare and quality of living (38 words). Competitiveness factor and determinant presence definition is less obvious, general message is that certain institution, policy and factor (human or physical) conditions must exist, but not specifically defined as special skills (3), knowledge (0), innovations (5), capabilities (4), exports (5), owners (2), human resource (8), strategies (1), information and communication (0), customers (7), competitors (11), business (9), academic (1), political (2) could be explained by intentional types of definitions providing the essence of the term, but mot the every detail of it. Conclusions The term competitiveness is associated with firm or company level in equal frequency as to country and nation level, but sector, industry and regional competitiveness is even less present. Evident is the fact that  Competitiveness  is the quality and ability to achieve something, on the international global level with their products and services. The results might differ if the whole articles would be analyzed, since the definitions very often lack the context, purpose and main variables of the research what lead to the conclusion and finally to definition of competitiveness. Further research using software content analysis with more specific focus will be performed, on industry and company level, and factor specific and with coding of data of the textual material and extensional definitions. Additionally to above mentioned competitiveness factor intensity and synergy is planned to research.","[Plumins, Maris; Sceulovs, Deniss; Gaile-Sarkane, Elina] Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Plumins, M (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",mplumins@yahoo.com,"Gaile-Sarkane, Elina/HLQ-5653-2023",,,,,,73,3,4,3,12,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,379,386,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200047,0

The ability of organisations to compete in today's complex business climate relies on effective management of intangibles and the development of strategies to leverage and exploit knowledge assets. Yet, knowledge is intrinsically linked to individuals and their exclusive capabilities to execute knowledge processes, such as creation and sharing in addition to their competence in utilising available IC to drive organisational performance. Knowledge-holding employees are key knowledge assets which lead the organisation's efforts to create value, overcome challenges, and confront uncertainty. However, despite the fundamental role of individuals in firm knowledge dynamics, the IC and Knowledge Management (KM) literature often addresses organisational knowledge holistically, seldom focusing on its individual-based origins. The purpose of this study is thus to investigate the concept of individual knowledge and explore its underlying constructs based on the views of both practitioners and researchers. Moving from a literature review, the industry perspective is introduced through the findings gleaned from semi-structured interviews of a number of senior managers from various industries. Interviews explored managers' conceptualisations of the individual knowledge notion and their perceptions of the unique attributes of knowledge holders. Qualitative interview responses are interpreted through thematic analysis of the data to identify themes and gain practicable insights. Managers highlighted a number of elements of knowledge that contribute to IC and KM and practice. The identified dimensions of individual knowledge are summarised in the proposed IK4 Model, which offers a simple yet comprehensive framework to operationalise the individual knowledge concept in organisational contexts.","[Ragab, Mohamed A.

Included among the many offices and bureaus in 2014 were 78 regulatory agencies with more than 276,000 employees who in recent years turned out annually some 80,000 Federal Register pages of rules and rule modifications. A successful president, e.g., one who can be reelected or help to pave the way for the party in the next election, must find ways to steer bureau activities in his preferred direction while delivering on regulatory promises made in the process of being elected. White House review of proposed regulations provides an opportunity for presidents to affect regulatory outcomes in ways that reward politically important interest groups. Our review of all empirical work on White House review as well as our own institutional and statistical findings yield strong support to the notion that the review process provides opportunities to make presidential preferences operational.","[Shamoun, Dima Yazji; Yandle, Bruce] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Shamoun, Dima Yazji] Sothwestern Univ, Georgetown, TX USA; [Yandle, Bruce] Clemson Univ, Coll Business & Behav Sci, Clemson, SC USA",George Mason University; Clemson University,"Yandle, B (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.;Yandle, B (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Coll Business & Behav Sci, Clemson, SC USA.",yandle@bellsouth.net,,,,,,,50,3,4,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2016,166.0,1-2,,,,,87,111,,10.1007/s11127-016-0316-9,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DG8GY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372322300005,0

In recognition of this potential, in recent years, Ethiopia has shown renewed interest in promoting cooperatives. However, there is lack of empirical evidence of the impact that cooperatives have on farmers' performance in Ethiopia. Using a matching technique, we evaluate the impact of coffee cooperatives on the performance of their member households in terms of income and coffee production. We use data from coffee farmers in south-west Ethiopia. The overall results suggest that members of cooperatives are not faring much better than non-members. The treatment effects we measured were not statistically significant from zero. Yet, the aggregate figures mask differences between cooperatives and amongst individual cooperative members. Average treatment effects on members differ between cooperatives, in general older members, those who have benefitted from more education and those with larger coffee plantations seem to benefit more from membership. Our analysis sheds light on the heterogeneity in the impact that membership of a cooperative can have: this differs by cooperative and by members within cooperatives, a finding that has important policy implications.","[Shumeta, Zekarias] Jimma Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 307, Jimma, Ethiopia; [D'Haese, Marijke] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Jimma University; Ghent University,"Shumeta, Z (通讯作者)，Jimma Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 307, Jimma, Ethiopia.",zekishum@yahoo.com,,"D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420",Netherlands Organization for Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC),Netherlands Organization for Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC),The authors are grateful for The Netherlands Organization for Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC) for financing this research project.,,36,37,39,9,44,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

And where this mechanism fails, competition policy has to work in such a way as to maintain and support conditions ensuring an effective competitive environment. These facts also apply to the Slovak Republic as a member state of the EU. The Slovak Republic and its respective institution, i.e. the Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak Republic, always look for ways of making competition policy more efficient. The contribution focuses on changes in the field of restriction of competition which are in force in Slovakia since 2014, or which have been adopted later. These changes refine the Slovak competition law and align it with European competition law.

The models are verified using data on chosen European countries from time period 1970 to 2011 and from time period 2000 to 2011. Taxes are included into models by indicators of tax burden. It was used TQ, ITR and WTI. The results of empirical analysis revealed that impact of taxes on economic growth is negative in a long term. The most negative impact on economic growth was proven in case of direct taxes. Economic growth is influenced positively by indirect taxes. The statistical significance of corporate tax and property taxes were not proven.","[Vrablikova, Vera] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Vráblíková, V (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",vera.vrablikova@vsb.cz,,,,,,,34,5,5,1,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Methodology/methods The success of loan and guarantee funds was measured by the number and value of loan or guarantees issued. In order to evaluate the results of loan and guarantee funds and to realize the goal, the zero-unitarisation method, T-test, Pearson correlation and one-way between-groups ANOVA analysis were used. Scientific aim The findings can be important in evaluation of different types of institutions offering SMEs financial instruments and can help to find reasons of success or defeat of programs directed to SMEs. Findings The analysis showed that loan funds with lower provision achieve better results, however interest rate or scope of the offer turned out to be not important. For guarantee funds the value of the guarantee and number of cooperating banks (the lower number the better results) were the most important for their achievements. The guarantee funds with strong bank partners (usually with shares in the guarantee fund) had better results. Guarantee funds with many cooperating banks had worse achievements. It lets to formulate the thesis, that it is more important to find one cooperating bank than many banks with which the cooperation may be weaker. It may explain the outstanding outcomes of SOCAMA, the network of mutual guarantee funds in France, which cooperates only with group of cooperative banks -les banques populaires. Conclusions The analysis is conducted for loan and guarantee funds in Poland. In every country different systems of small and medium enterprises' support are organized. Therefore findings in the paper can't be directly generalized for all similar institutions all over the world.","[Waniak-Michalak, Halina] Univ Lodz, Management Fac, Accounting Dept, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Waniak-Michalak, H (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Management Fac, Accounting Dept, Lodz, Poland.",michalakh@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,70,78,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200008,0

These new statistical methods estimate the local time-varying slope coefficient of the regression of spot returns on the lagged interest rate differential. Uniform confidence bands are used to test when uncovered interest parity is violated. The estimated betas in the forward premium smoothed regression are found to vary substantially over time and to be partially explicable in terms of lagged fundamentals and money growth volatilities arising from risk premium.

Such concern may stem from the counterparty risk assumed by market participants and the high sensitivity of these instruments to the business cycle. The open interest of the CDS market mirrors investors' maximum exposure and captures aggregate inventory risk, liquidity risk, and trading activity. In this paper, we aim to identify the main determinants of the dynamics of two alternative measures of open interest, the gross and net notional amounts. Our results suggest that both asymmetry of information and divergence of opinions on firms' future performance help explain the growth of the net notional amount of single-reference contracts, but systematic factors have a much greater influence. Net notional amount growth of different obligors co-varies in time and the dynamics of open interest is pro-cyclical. The CDS market expands following a positive stock market performance and contracts when large negative (positive) jumps in stock (CDS) prices are perceived by investors. In line with the market microstructure theory, funding costs and counterparty risk reduce CDS market players' willingness to incur inventory risk, thus contracting gross notional amounts.

In this paper a two- country stylized model with imperfect competition in the recycling market is used to address two research questions. First, how do EPR recycling targets interact with other policy instruments such as taxes on recycling residues and excise duties? Second, how does strategic behavior of national policy makers influences the use of policy instruments? The model demonstrates that a combination of EPR with other instruments is needed to achieve the first- best outcome. When governments do not coordinate policies across borders, strategic behavior may lead to a ` race to the bottom' for taxes on recycling residues. Conversely, strategic behavior may lead to a counter- intuitive ` race to the top' for excise duties and EPR recycling targets. It is shown that these instruments are not only used to stimulate waste prevention but also to extract rents from foreign recyclers.","[Dubois, M.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Policy Res Ctr Sustainable Mat, Kasteelpk Arenberg 44,Bus 2450, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Eyckmans, J.] Ctr Econ & Corp Sustainability, KU Leuven Campus Brussels, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Dubois, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Policy Res Ctr Sustainable Mat, Kasteelpk Arenberg 44,Bus 2450, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",maarten.dubois@kuleuven.be,"Eyckmans, Johan/AAN-6590-2020","Eyckmans, Johan/0000-0002-2885-4740",,,,,31,10,10,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Parties face a trade-off between selecting loyal candidates or experts, who are highly valued by the voters and thus increase the probability of winning the election. Voters can be rational or behavioral. The former cares about the quality mix of the elected candidates in the winning party, and hence about the ordering on the party list The latter only concentrate on the quality type of the candidates in the top positions of the party list Our theoretical model shows that, to persuade rational voters, parties optimally allocate loyalists to safe seats and experts to uncertain positions. Persuading behavioral voters instead requires to position the experts visibly on top of the electoral list. Our empirical analysis, which uses data from the 2013 National election in Italy held under closed list proportional representation and from independent pre-electoral polls, is overall supportive of voters' rational behavior. Loyalists (i.e., party officers or former members of Parliament who mostly voted along party lines) are overrepresented in safe positions, and, within both safe and uncertain positions, they are ranked higher in the list (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By restricting the sample to only those who are already homeless and introducing the concept of a homelessness intensity measure, I exploit variation in individual characteristics and usage of a Check-In Center to predict the intensity of homelessness (defined as the ratio of actual homeless nights to potential homeless nights). By making use of a novel application of the weighted least squares estimator, I am able to estimate coefficients that are design-unbiased for the population values. By using an instrument, I find that the Check-In Center has a large negative effect on the intensity of homelessness. The self-reported cause of homelessness is a determining factor as well. I also find, as would be expected, that education and the presence of family nearby lessens the intensity of homelessness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Based on gold prices denominated in five different currencies and the related bilateral exchange rates, we put causalities and short-run volatility transmission under closer scrutiny. We provide evidence that the identification of a strong hedge function of gold requires an explicit modeling of the volatility component. For all currencies, exchange rate depreciations initially have a negative impact on the gold price after one day which turns out to be positive after two days in most of the cases. Contrary to previous studies, our results point to a specific role of the dollar in the context of gold-exchange rate relationships: volatility of dollar exchange rates more frequently results in strong hedging functions of gold prices. Furthermore, the gold price denominated in the US dollar tends to increase after a depreciation of the dollar.

The experiment shows that heterogeneity of expectations does not decrease when investors have more information about the final results.

The paper provides a comparison of various constraints and conditions under which these constraints help match certain empirical facts about asset prices. Under these conditions, borrowing and short-sale constraints decrease stock return volatilities, whereas limited stock market participation constraints amplify them. Moreover, borrowing constraints generate spikes in interest rates and volatilities and have stronger effects on asset prices than short-sale constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The global interbank market constitutes a major part of the global banking system. The market has a hierarchical network structure, composed of the national or jurisdictional area's local markets and the cross-border interbank market. First, we estimate the bilateral exposures matrix using aggregate financial data on loans and deposits from Bankscope and analyze the interconnectedness in the market using network centrality measures. Subsequently, for the model analysis, we apply the Eisenberg-Noe framework to a multi-period setting. In this framework, bank defaults are classified into stand-alone defaults and contagious defaults. The banks in our sample (i.e., the top 202 banks with more than $50 billion in total assets) comprise a major part of this global banking system. The main findings are as follows: The theoretical network analysis using network centrality measures showed that most of the banks designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) play a central role in the global interbank market. The theoretical default analysis showed a few contagious defaults triggered by the basic defaults during and after the global financial crisis. Our stress test proved that many G-SIBs theoretically caused 1-6 contagious defaults. Our methodology would assist in the development of a monitoring system by the respective supervisory authorities as well as in the implementation of bank-internal stress tests of default contagion.

Financially constrained arbitrageurs may choose to seek additional financing from banks that have the technology to profit from the strategies themselves. A holdup problem arises because banks cannot commit to providing capital. To minimize competition, arbitrageurs will choose to stay constrained and underinvest in the arbitrage unless banks have sufficient reputational capital. This problem arises when mispricing is largest. More competition among financiers, higher arbitrageur wealth, and allowing for explicit contracts can worsen the holdup problem. When arbitrage is risky, financial relationships are more valuable, mitigating the problem.","[Kondo, Jiro E.] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Papanikolaou, Dimitris] Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Papanikolaou, Dimitris] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",McGill University; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kondo, JE (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,", CONTRACT_ADMIN/KCX-9603-2024",", CONTRACT_ADMIN/0000-0002-4337-5705",,,,,37,3,3,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

When premiums for both insurance options are actuarially fair, more than five times as many people favor the 2-period contract over the 1-period contract. The demand for a 2-period contract remains high even with a loading cost of 5% and 10% while keeping the 1-period premium actuarially fair, indicating a preference for stable premiums over time.

We develop a stylized three-period life cycle model of life insurance demand and test its predictions regarding tax changes and bequests motives. An unexpected halving of the tax exemption limit for interest and dividend income in Germany allows us to identify the impact of changes in taxation on the demand for life insurance in a difference-in-differences setting. In line with our theoretical predictions, we document that ownership of life insurance products increased significantly among households affected by the reform.

It can be regarded a forward-looking measure of idiosyncratic sovereign default risk as perceived by financial markets. For some European countries this premium featured distinct nonstationary and heteroskedastic pattern during the last years. Using a Markovswitching unobserved component model, we decompose the daily CDS term premium of five European countries into two unobserved components of statistically different nature and link them in a vector autoregression to various daily observed financial market variables. We find that such decomposition is vital for understanding the short-term dynamics of this premium. The strongest impacts can be attributed to CDS market liquidity, local stock returns, and overall risk aversion. By contrast, the impact of shocks from the sovereign bond market is rather muted. Therefore, the CDS market microstructure effect and investor sentiment play the main roles in sovereign risk evaluation in real time. Moreover, we also find that the CDS term premium response to shocks is regime-dependent and can be ten times stronger during periods of high volatility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It has recently been shown that revenue projection errors have a direct impact on fiscal deficits. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the ideology of the finance minister and tax revenue projection errors, and assess how the stringency of fiscal rules alters this relationship. We use a panel dataset of 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980-2007 as well as a new dataset of 99 finance ministers at the cantonal level. Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that the allocation of the departments - including the department of finance - to the elected politicians is a random process from the point of view of the voters. We identify a rather counter-intuitive positive effect of the ideology of the finance minister on tax revenue projection errors in the sense that a more left-wing finance minister produces relatively more conservative forecasts. We also find that fiscal rules reduce the effect of ideology on tax revenue projection errors. These results suggest that left-wing finance ministers need to curb deficits relatively more in order to signal the same level of competence to the voters than right-wing finance ministers. They also suggest that fiscal rules render the signal less informative to the voters and thereby reduce the incentive for left-wing finance ministers to be more conservative in their projections.

In a within-subjects framework, we elicit subjects' other regarding attitude as well as preference towards risk via respectively the ring test (Griesinger and Livingston [1973]) and the Holt and Laury test [2002]. These measures are then exploited in two different sorts of giving games: (i) a standard trust game, which by construction embodies a dimension of risk (i.e. the transfer-back from the receiver to the sender), and (ii) a (triple) dictator game in which the component of risk is removed. The measures of other regarding preferences and risk preferences were also used to explain the gaps of transfer due to strategic anticipation. The results show that giving behavior in trust game is driven by other regarding preferences and not by risk-related considerations. However, we find no significant correlation between the gaps of transfer and both social and risk preferences.","[Garapin, Alexis; Muller, Laurent; Rahali, Bilel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL UMR1215, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Garapin, Alexis; Muller, Laurent; Rahali, Bilel] INRA, UMR GAEL 1215, F-38040 Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Garapin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL UMR1215, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",,,,ANR (France) [ANR-08-JCJC-0111-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0111] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR (France)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We wish to thank Jean-Loup Dupuis for technical assistance with the computer laboratory and Liz Libbrecht for editorial assistance.

We propose a model in which heterogeneity in perceived product quality affects consumer adoption. If consumers experientially infer the quality of a technology, an increase in initial exposure to a low-quality product may inhibit subsequent diffusion. Incentives intended to speed up adoption may in fact have the opposite effect, if they propagate low-quality signals. We examine the predictions of the model using sales data for 11 hybrid-vehicle models between 2000 and 2006. Consistent with press reports that the first-generation Insight was perceived to be of lower quality than the first-generation Prius, we find that, conditional on overall hybrid vehicle adoption in the first 2 years, locations with a relatively high Prius market share experienced faster subsequent adoption than states with a relatively high Insight market share. We estimate the elasticity of new hybrid sales with respect to the Prius penetration rate is 0.30-0.58, while the elasticity with respect to the Insight penetration rate is 0.14 to 0.44.","[Heutel, Garth] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Muehlegger, Erich] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Heutel, Garth; Muehlegger, Erich] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Muehlegger, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gheutel@gsu.edu; emuehlegger@ucdavis.edu,,"Muehlegger, Erich/0000-0002-5670-7895",,,,,34,20,28,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To that end, it derives a capital composition index, where the share of a particular type of capital in the total capital stock is determined by its embodied efficiency. The paper constructs its empirical counterpart using capital production and trade data. Using five-year averaged data between 1976 and 2001 for 60 countries, it provides evidence on the positive effects of financial flows on the capital stock's quality, with the largest impact coming from equity inflows. It also shows that when the capital composition is accounted for, the direct effect of financial flows on TFP diminishes. Although financial flows do not directly affect growth, they raise it indirectly by improving the composition of a country's capital stock. All else constant, financial flows explain a growth difference of 1.10 percentage points between the countries with total liabilities equal to the first quartile and the third quartile. Finally, the paper finds that the effect of financial flows on the composition of capital and therefore GDP growth is larger for less developed countries, and smaller and insignificant for countries with less developed financial markets.","[Leblebicioglu, Asli] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Madariaga, Jessica] Coll Charleston, Dept Econ, Charleston, SC USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; College of Charleston,"Leblebicioglu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75230 USA.",,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This paper proposes an extension of the CoVaR methodology in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) to capture the asymmetric response of the banking system to positive and negative shocks to the market-valued balance sheets of individual banks. Building on a comprehensive sample of U.S. banks in the period 1990-2010, the evidence in this paper shows that ignoring asymmetries that feature tail-interdependences may lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk. On average, the relative impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is sevenfold that of an increase. Moreover, the downward bias in systemic-risk measuring from ignoring this asymmetric pattern increases with bank size. In particular, the conditional tail-comovement between the banking system and a bank that is losing market value belonging to the top size-sorted decile is nearly 5.5 times larger than the unconditional tail-comovement versus 3.3 times for banks in the bottom decile. The asymmetric model also produces much better fitting, with the restriction that gives rise to the standard symmetric model being rejected for most firms in the sample, particularly, in the segment of large-scale banks. This result is important from a regulatory and supervisory perspective, since the asymmetric generalization enhances the capacity to monitor systemic interdependences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Companies' liquidity risk shows up in the three levels of fair value information (level 1-mark to market, level 2-market observable input and level 3-mark to model) disclosed in their balance sheets, with level 3 illiquid assets representing a greater liquidity risk and resulting in a greater company liquidity risk. The role played by liquidity risk information in investors' decision-making is explored by analyzing their reactions to liquidity-constraining events, capital injections and bank bailouts for 313 European companies. The empirical evidence is based on the fixed effects model and Partial Least Squares regressions. These findings demonstrate that investors' reactions to the crisis events are affected by the liquidity risk conveyed by the levels of fair value hierarchy in both financial and non-financial firms. During liquidity-constraining events, investors have stronger negative reactions to companies with more level 3 illiquid assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. During liquidity-expanding events, investors react more positively to companies with more illiquid assets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The paper's primary purpose is to investigate the validity of Olson's propositions concerning group size, group composition, and institutional design. This purpose is accomplished by drawing on the literature and the paper's game-theoretic representations. Key considerations behind the validity of his propositions concern benefit rivalry, the aggregation technology, strategic assumptions, and participation costs. The difference between public good and commons games is also an essential consideration. Generally, Olson's propositions fare best for benefit rivalry, a summation aggregator, Nash behavior, and positive participation costs. Because his propositions are true in many important real-world situations, the book remains highly relevant. Efforts to find exceptions to Olson's propositions have served to further our understanding of collective action.","Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dept Econ, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,55,53,64,5,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,195,216,,10.1007/s11127-015-0252-0,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500002,0

We use household survey data collected from 3,040 households as part of the Realigning Agriculture for Improved Nutrition (RAIN) intervention in Zambia. The data indicate low agricultural diversity, low dietary diversity and high levels of chronic malnutrition overall in this area.

We investigate experimentally the role that the specific punishment technology adopted plays in this context, and test to what extent punishing behavior can be truly attributed to negative emotions. We find that a large part (around 70%) of the punishment behavior observed in previous PTTG studies is explained by the technology of punishment adopted instead of negative emotions. Once this effect is removed, negative emotions do still play an important role, but the efficiency costs associated to them are much smaller. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The increase in foreign participation has therefore not been associated with a growing number of banks. This study aims to examine the competitive behavior of foreign and local banks as a competitive banking industry is important in boosting economic efficiency and economic growth. This study also examines the role of modes of entry of foreign banks on competition, either through the establishment of foreign de novo banks or the acquisition of local banks. The recent methodological refinements of the Panzar-Rosse method developed bynikket et al. (2011) are employed to estimate the level of competition among local and foreign banks. Generally, the foreign banks, particularly foreign de novo banks behaved more competitively than local banks, and their penetration is therefore important in creating a contestable market. This study found that in terms of assets, on average foreign de novo banks were smaller, more efficient, and had lower overhead costs, so they could offer lower loan rates and disburse more loans. The recent consolidation in the Indonesian banking industry may have an adverse impact on competition as it restricts the establishment of foreign de novo banks. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We recommend new focus on this deliberation and policy piggybacking hospital delivery, vaccination and information and communications technology to re-balance parent decision.","[Pelowski, Matthew] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Psychol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wamai, Richard G.] Northeastern Univ, Dept African Amer Studies, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wangombe, Joseph; Nyakundi, Hellen] Univ Nairobi, Sch Publ Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya; [Oduwo, Geofrey O.] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ngugi, Benjamin K.] Suffolk Univ, Sawyer Business Sch, Informat Syst & Operat Management, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ogembo, Javier G.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Worcester, MA 01655 USA",University of Copenhagen; Northeastern University; University of Nairobi; Kenyatta University; Suffolk University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester,"Ogembo, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, 364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01655 USA.",javier.ogembo@umassmed.edu,,"Ogembo, Javier Gordon/0000-0001-6949-8693; Pelowski, Matthew/0000-0001-5563-3727; Oduwo, Geofrey/0000-0003-2530-5428",Nokia Corporation; Plan Finland,Nokia Corporation(Nokia Corporation); Plan Finland,"The authors would like to thank Plan Kenya for the opportunity to conduct this study as a component of their Universal Birth Registration initiative.

In contrast, we do not find a relation between executives' frugality and the propensity to perpetrate fraud. However, as predicted, we find that unfrugal CEOs oversee a relatively loose control environment characterized by relatively high and increasing probabilities of other insiders perpetrating fraud and unintentional material reporting errors during their tenure. Further, cultural changes associated with an increase in fraud risk are more likely during unfrugal (vs. frugal) CEOs' reigns, including the appointment of an unfrugal CFO, an increase in executives' equity-based incentives to misreport, and a decline in measures of board monitoring intensity.

We focus on assessing the out-of-sample predictability of hedge fund strategies by employing an extensive list of predictors. Aiming at reducing uncertainty risk associated with a single predictor model, we first engage into combining the individual forecasts. We consider various combining methods ranging from simple averaging schemes to more sophisticated ones, such as discounting forecast errors, cluster combining and principal components combining. Our second approach combines information of the predictors and applies kitchen sink, bootstrap aggregating (bagging), lasso, ridge and elastic net specifications. Our statistical and economic evaluation findings point to the superiority of simple combination methods. We also provide evidence on the use of hedge fund return forecasts for hedge fund risk measurement and portfolio allocation. Dynamically constructing portfolios based on the combination forecasts of hedge funds returns leads to considerably improved portfolio performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One feature of monetary unification, which replaces diverse currencies with a common currency, is that it brings about a change in the comparison environment, expanding the reference space of individuals in a given country to encompass individuals from the joining countries. Overall, calculations regarding six enlargements of the Economic and Monetary Union between 1999 and 2011 reveal an increase of ARD on six occasions when we hold incomes constant, and on five when we take into consideration changes in incomes.

We characterize the optimal contract under general convex adjustment cost functions and provide examples for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We show that, as in the data, small firms invest more, grow faster, and have a higher Tobin's Q than large firms under the optimal contract In addition, the pattern of the dependence of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on past performance implied by our model is also consistent with empirical evidence.

We find that the announcement date market reaction is lower than that in the US, mainly because of (i) the relatively large number of recurring announcements which generate significantly lower returns than the initial announcements of intention to repurchase shares; (ii) the rather low market reaction in France, due probably to specific governance and corporate cultural issues; and (iii) the regulatory reform that allowed UK firms to keep the repurchased shares as treasury stock, which decreased their market impact. Across our countries, taxation, shareholder protection, and the European Union's Market Abuse Directive do not affect significantly the market valuation of repurchases. Our results imply that ultimately, domestic institutional specificities and reforms play significant roles in the market valuation and popularity of share repurchases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, the fact that the model excludes financial firms is significant because financial firms are a large fraction of the value of the U.S. stock market. Also, there is no theoretical reason for excluding financial firms. Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) suggest that leverage affects beta, but it does not invalidate the capital asset pricing model. It would therefore be more satisfying if the pricing model applied generally, rather than being restricted to non-financial corporations. Thus, we assess the validity of size and value risk as common risk factors to measure of the cross-section of expected stock returns in financial companies. Empirical asset pricing tests suggest two findings. First, size and value risk premia commonly exists in both nonfinancial and financial firms, even if two factors are less explicable in financial firms. Second, an interest rate risk premium (Delta L/L) which defined as a financial firm specific risk factor only appears in financial companies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings indicate that the period under examination is characterised by a substantial increase in the flow of inheritance. This increase, which was particularly marked in the early 2000s, was mainly driven by an increase in housing inheritance, which in turn reflected the rise in house prices and, to a lesser extent, the increase in the proportion of inheritances that included housing assets. The distribution of inheritance amongst recipients became more unequal over this period. However, the inequality-increasing effect from the greater dispersion in the distribution of inheritance was counterbalanced by the increase in the percentage of the population who received an inheritance, resulting in a small decrease in the inequality of inheritance for the population overall. Analysis of the distribution of inheritance by socio-economic status suggests a positive association between inheritance and socio-economic status, with some evidence suggesting that this association might have strengthened over time. Overall, however, the value of inheritance for most people is rather small and the differences across groups rather moderate.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Karagiannaki, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",e.karagiannaki@lse.ac.uk,,,Nuffield Foundation; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Nuffield Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Data for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), Attitudes to Inheritances Survey (AIS), General Household Survey (GHS) and Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) were made available by the UK Data Archive.

As a result, the opportunity cost of the loss of employment for these migrants declines. In addition, the potential wealth arising from compensation for expropriated rural land increases significantly with ongoing urbanization in China. This weakens the incentive for landowning rural migrants to work as hard in urban employment as they might otherwise. In this paper, we employ the Floating Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey for Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in 2012, as surveyed by the Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission to assess the employment disincentives induced by rural land ownership. We find that compared with landless rural migrants, landowning rural migrants generally have less job stability and lower salaries.","[Rao, Can; Zhu, Hongfei] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jingwen] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Wuhan University,"Zhu, HF (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Sch Econ 602, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhuhongfei@fudan.edu.cn,,,"Social Science Foundation of China [11CJL024, 11ZD006, 12ZD074]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [71373047]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project [13YJA790110]; Shanghai's University Innovation Ability Promotion",Social Science Foundation of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project; Shanghai's University Innovation Ability Promotion,"We are indebted to Zheng Song (Chicago University), Dihai Wang, and Xiaoyan Fan (Fudan University) for their comments.

It is unclear whether incumbents in proportional systems should enjoy such a large advantage. Multi-seat constituencies make it difficult for individual incumbents to claim credit for the provision of local public goods and services. Moreover, multiple incumbents may dilute media attention thereby limiting name recognition advantage. We use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of incumbency using election data from Ireland's system of proportional representation with a single transferable vote (PR-SW). Incumbency causes an eighteen percentage point increase in the probability that a candidate in Ireland's lower house of parliament wins a seat in the next election. Our results indicate that the protection of vulnerable incumbents from intra-party competition may be a source of incumbency advantage in multi-member district elections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, all of them are based on subjective evaluations by experts or confined to measuring the legally prescribed level of independence.

Econometric models show government-connected SMEs receive more formal credit than their counterparts. The small share of SME credit available is thus distributed in favour of those capitalising on bureaucratic links, with consequent resource misallocation.

Based on this framework, we analyze whether central banks are able to influence stock market developments.

Spanish securitization transactions are analyzed using event study methodology which reveals that securitization drains banks' wealth, was most pernicious immediately prior to the subprime crisis and affects small and medium-sized banks most with respect to mortgage collateral transactions. The indirect effect of securitization on originator risk does not affect share value, while the direct effect gives a positive relationship. This effect becomes non-significant in the years prior to the crisis and the shareholders no longer perceive this risk transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These problems in application are serious to the point of impeding our ability to do policy work. This essay will focus on two areas of econometric application; first, the violation of the fundamental exogeneity condition for applied econometrics , where is a stochastic error term and is a matrix of right-hand-side explanatory variables, and second, the inappropriate use of data that is available for analysis. Both problems deal with the econometric issues of omitted and proxy variables. I will also comment on data necessary to carry out proper fisheries econometric research and policy analysis. Simulation techniques based on a known population regression equation are used to illustrate the extent of the empirical problems. Injecting real data into the simulations shows the bias that we can bring forward to the policy arena.","[Gordon, Daniel V.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gordon, Daniel V.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway",University of Calgary; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Gordon, DV (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",dgordon@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,19,17,18,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

They distinguish between trade in goods and trade in services within both sectors, and between exports and imports. At the firm level, they find that firms that start to export or import goods experience significant increases in productivity and size. The effects of services trade are typically smaller, confined to exports and vary across sectors. At the sector level, they find that international trade plays a potentially larger role for the productivity development within the service sector than within the manufacturing sector, but it is trade in goods not trade in services that matters most. This suggests that trade intermediaries play an important role for productivity growth in the economy.","[Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Copenhagen Business Sch, CEBR, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Munch, Jakob R.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Skaksen, Jan Rose] Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res KORA, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Munch, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",Jakob.Roland.Munch@econ.ku.dk,,"Munch, Jakob Roland/0000-0002-4387-1039; Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj/0000-0001-5350-3152",Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN),Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN),We would like to thank participants at ETSG Leuven 2012 for helpful suggestions and comments.

However, to date no research has examined lying and lie detection in the financial industry. This paper presents an empirical examination of investment professionals' beliefs about deception. We obtained survey data from 607 CFA Institute charter holders across the world. Three aspects of deception were included in the survey. First, respondents' beliefs about the behavioral characteristics of lying were examined. Second, perceptions of the prevalence of lies in professional and everyday life were mapped. Third, respondents were asked to estimate their ability to distinguish between lies and truths. The results showed that respondents subscribed to common misconceptions about deceptive behavior, in particular the beliefs that liars are gaze aversive and fidgety. Respondents believed that lying occurs on a daily basis, and that their accuracy in detecting lies exceeds 65%. Previous research suggests that this estimate may be overconfident. Implications of these results and directions for future research on deception in the financial industry are discussed.","[Hartwig, Maria] CUNY, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Wallace, D.

The results of our estimates show that corruption significantly increases inefficiency, a finding that is robust to the inclusion of alternative local corruption indicators and other control variables such as geographical, demographic, and political factors.

The pay raise is larger when incumbent executives have greater employment mobility in the labor market, when companies lose senior executives, and when job-hopping executives receive favorable job offers in their new firms. A company's subsequent pay raise to incumbent executives after losing an executive diminishes its deficiency in executive compensation relative to its industry peer firms, and is effective at retaining its incumbent executives.

Furthermore, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, politically-connected financial firms had higher leverage and were more likely to increase their leverage during the housing bubble in response to local growth in median housing prices. During the crisis, higher leverage was associated with worse performance but being in a state with a US Senator on the Banking Committee was correlated with weakly improved stock returns and reduced bankruptcy probability, highlighting the value of political connections for financial firms.

It is therefore necessary to understand how the elderly have financed their later years. To study how old-age financing has evolved in Taiwan, we have adopted the National Transfer Accounts approach in order to estimate four major financing channels in 1985 and 2005. Our results show that public transfers and asset-based reallocations have gradually replaced family support and labor income. This suggests the need for individuals to save before retirement, and for the state to take a larger role in the caring for elderly in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We look at one- and two-day event windows to check two possible reactions of the market: changes in the value of an equal-weight portfolio, and changes in the relative price of the stocks. The results show that the market reacted to the Global 100 Ranking by changing the relative price of the stocks, but not the value of the portfolio. Specifically, getting one position closer to the top of Newsweek's Global 100 Green Rankings increases the value of an average firm in the list by eleven million dollars. There is also some evidence of a stronger reaction of non-US-traded stocks compared to US-traded ones. Non-heavy sector stocks display a more robust reaction than heavy sector stocks. We find that investors in US-traded stocks are interested in past environmental performance and managerial quality, while the second is more relevant for investors in non-US-traded stocks.

The empirical evidence in this domain remains inconclusive because of the contrasting results observed in the literature, owing to the differing characteristics of the data sets and models used in previous studies. The present study carries out a meta-analysis on a sample of published and unpublished papers on the so-called pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) in order to investigate whether certain aspects of research design affect the presented findings. The paper offers explanations for the mixed findings reported in the literature by suggesting that certain aspects of research design are crucial to explaining their significance. The PHH is more likely to be supported by studies that define FDI as the establishment of new plants and those that use government spending as a proxy for the strictness of environmental regulations. Moreover, focusing investigations on pollution-intensive industries or developing countries hardly increases the likelihood of achieving results that support the PHH.","Norwegian Sch Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Rezza, AA (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",alief.rezza@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,27,28,1,40,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

For our analysis, we employ the class of stable distributions that has become prominent in the real estate literature. We add to the literature by undertaking a global-scale analysis for the first time. By using data since the early 1990s, we show that there is considerable variation in the tail weights of return distributions, both between countries as well as among sectors within the countries. It is important to note that the tail parameters vary over time as well. Our results strengthen the notion of non-constant tail parameters in stable distributions that followed earlier findings of constant tail parameters. In addition, our results provide evidence that it is merely the time horizon that causes variation in parameters, than purely methodological differences.","[Stein, Michael] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Piazolo, Daniel] IPD MSCI Germany, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany; [Stoyanov, Stoyan V.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",University of Duisburg Essen; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Stein, M (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.",michael.stein@uni-due.de; daniel.piazolo@ipd.com; stoyan.stoyanov@stonybrook.edu,"Piazolo, Daniel/AAH-7532-2020",,,,,,38,3,3,0,8,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We show that CC with a market trigger, in which direct stakeholders are unable to choose optimal conversion policies, does not lead to a unique competitive equilibrium unless value transfer at conversion is not expected ex ante. The no value transfer restriction precludes penalizing bank managers for taking excessive risk. Multiplicity or absence of equilibrium introduces the potential for price uncertainty, market manipulation, inefficient capital allocation, and frequent conversion errors.","[Sundaresan, Suresh] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wang, Zhenyu] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Columbia University; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Sundaresan, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,44,75,84,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

However, most of them ignored the heterogeneity of FDI. This paper studies the PHE on local-market-oriented and export-oriented FDI and tests whether the two types have different responsiveness to environmental regulations in a host country. A simple model is developed to describe how different types of multinational companies respond in distinct ways to stricter environmental policies in host countries. Using US outward FDI data for 50 host countries and a survey measure of both the stringency and the enforcement of local environmental regulations, I find a significant deterrent effect of local environmental regulations on inward FDI. Furthermore, FDI in a host country is not only affected by local environmental regulations but also by environmental regulations in proximate countries. More importantly, accounting for the relative stringency of environmental regulations between a host country and the United States is critical for identifying a PHE. I find a significantly stronger effect of environmental policies on both types of FDI in host countries with environmental regulations that are stricter than those in the United States. In these countries, export-oriented FDI also exhibits a greater sensitivity to local environmental regulations than local market-oriented FDI.","Ernst & Young LLP, Quantitat Econ & Stat, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Tang, JT (通讯作者)，Ernst & Young LLP, Quantitat Econ & Stat, 1101 New York Ave, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",jitao.tang@ey.com,,,,,,,36,64,69,6,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Interpreted through a family resource management lens, the results illuminate critical resources that allow families to manage work and family life while highlighting the demands the families often faced. Critical resources included accessing informal social support, managing work and family time, and seeking employment that supports work and family balance. Demands that threatened work and family balance included lack of flexibility in available resources and employment which make it difficult to balance work and family. Findings suggest the importance of developing community based programs to support both work and family as well educating employers on ways to support their employees.","[Katras, Mary Jo] Univ Minnesota Extens, Ctr Family Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55108 USA; [Sharp, Erin Hiley; Dolan, Elizabeth M.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Family Studies, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Baron, Laura Andrew] Boston Publ Hlth Commiss, Div Violence Prevent, Boston, MA USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Rochester; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Katras, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Extens, Ctr Family Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55108 USA.",mkatras@umn.edu,,"Katras, Mary Jo/0000-0002-7409-1625; Sharp, Erin Hiley/0000-0001-7735-4606",,,,,37,11,13,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using a sample of Chinese listed companies during the 2003-2009 period, we find that companies characterized by a wider divergence between the controlling shareholder's control and cash flow rights have a significantly higher cash flow sensitivity of cash. This result is consistent with the argument that the agency problem between the controlling shareholder and minority shareholders induces financing constraints. We also find that the divergence of the control and cash flow rights increases the cost of equity, suggesting that minority shareholders take into account the moral hazard of the controlling shareholder and demand higher risk premium. Our results imply that the moral hazard of the controlling shareholder prevents a firm from funding all its desired investments and that minority shareholders discount the terms at which they are willing to provide financing.

This practice relies on a mismatch in the characterization of heterogeneity in preferences: while discrete choice experiments usually assume homogeneity, latent class logits seek for discrete heterogeneity. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulations to study whether this mismatch impacts the reliability of welfare estimates. The experiment design in this paper varies i) the amount of discrete heterogeneity, and ii) the amount of information available through either number of pseudo-respondents or number of choice sets. Resulting estimates are unbiased with relatively large dispersion in every simulated scenario. Due to the large dispersion, the null hypothesis that a welfare measure is zero cannot be rejected. This false conclusion is reached even under scenarios in which the amount of simulated available information is larger than the amount of information usually available in empirical applications. Since simulated scenarios closely resemble features of empirical applications, findings from this paper imply that an analyst planning the estimation of a latent class logit on discrete choice data will need either (i) to collect more information than usually gathered in empirical applications; or (ii) to gather information about the source and/or magnitude of discrete heterogeneity, and include this information in the sample size calculation; or (iii) to design discrete choice experiments seeking efficient WTP estimates; or (iv) a strategy combining the previous three options.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPE, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Martínez-Cruz, AL (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPE, Zurich, Switzerland.",madan@ethz.ch,"Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./ABI-7504-2020","Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./0000-0001-7865-5339",,,,,36,2,2,0,20,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This paper links dynamic overlapping-generation and micro-simulation models of the United States to estimate the initial incidence of carbon taxes. We find that while carbon taxes are regressive, incidence depends much more on how carbon tax revenue is used. Recycling revenues to cut capital taxes is efficient but exacerbates regressivity. Lump sum rebates are less efficient, but much more progressive, benefitting the three lower income quintiles even when ignoring environmental benefits. A labor tax swap represents an intermediate option, as it is more progressive than a capital tax swap and more efficient than a rebate.","[Williams, Roberton C., III] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Williams, Roberton C., III; Gordon, Hal; Burtraw, Dallas; Carbone, Jared C.; Morgenstern, Richard D.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Williams, Roberton C., III] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carbone, Jared C.] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Resources for the Future; National Bureau of Economic Research; Colorado School of Mines,"Williams, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",roberton@umd.edu; gordon@rff.org; burtraw@rff.org; jcarbone@mines.edu; morgenst@rff.org,"Williams, Roberton/B-6706-2008","Williams, Roberton/0000-0001-8282-0974",Center for Climate and Electricity Policy at Resources for the Future; Smith Richardson Foundation; Bipartisan Policy Center; Mistra Indigo Program,Center for Climate and Electricity Policy at Resources for the Future; Smith Richardson Foundation; Bipartisan Policy Center; Mistra Indigo Program,"The authors thank the Center for Climate and Electricity Policy at Resources for the Future, the Smith Richardson Foundation, Mistra Indigo Program, and the Bipartisan Policy Center for support, and appreciate the assistance of Samuel Grausz and Daniel Velez-Lopez in model development.",,24,61,65,3,24,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

More precisely, we conduct an empirical study of the relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and corporate governance in the case of the Romanian non-financial listed companies. We use publicly-available information (financial statements, annual reports) and we mobilize a framework derived from the agency and signalling theories to interpret our findings from the statistical analysis based on correlations. Our results suggest that there are differences between industries and between the companies included or not in the new BET-TR index in terms of corporate entrepreneurship and corporate governance practices and disclosures. Agency theory partly explains our findings. Specifically, some corporate governance mechanisms, i.e. board independence and institutional ownership, are associated in our sample with corporate entrepreneurship. We thus document that corporate governance as a controlling and management technique fosters corporate entrepreneurship in Romanian companies. Signalling theory assumptions are generally not verified for the companies in our study. There are only a few associations between high values of corporate entrepreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship disclosures, and even fewer between corporate governance practices and corporate governance disclosures.","[Albu, Nadia; Mateescu, Ruxandra Adriana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Albu, N (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nadia.albu@cig.ase.ro,"Albu, Nadia/AAT-5491-2020","Albu, Nadia/0000-0003-2953-9619",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197 Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.

Two different climate change impact scenarios are simulated. This paper extends the Brazilian literature in three different ways: by considering detailed shocks by product and region; by highlighting the connections between the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and the labor market, with an inter-regional focus; and by specifying the links between climate change forecasts for agriculture and household expenditures. Results show that climate change impacts on Brazilian agriculture would have a relatively small economic effect on the Brazilian economy in aggregate terms, but with severe consequences at the regional level, making a strong case for losses that would be concentrated in the poorest regions and for the poorest workers and households in those regions.","[De Souza Ferreira Filho, Joaquim Bento] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz Queiroz Coll Agr, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [De Moraes, Gustavo Inacio] Pontifical Catholic Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Grad Program Econ, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul,"Ferreira, JBD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz Queiroz Coll Agr, Padua Dias 11, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",jbsferre@usp.br; gustavo.moraes@pucrs.br,,,,,,,35,10,13,0,50,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

First, the incumbent takeover may boost financial stability by providing bankers with incentives to be solvent so as to profit from their competitors' failure. Second, the incumbent takeover may spoil financial stability by creating Systemically Important Financial Institutions. The innovation of this paper is to capture these two effects in a theoretical model. We show that when incumbent bankers are impatient enough (i.e., they have high discount rates), the second effect prevails over the first one. We discuss the implications of this result for the design of bank resolution policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Following the model, loss rates are positively influenced by the house price level, the loan-to-value of mortgages, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. They are negatively influenced by the growth of house prices and the income level. The calibration of the model for the US and Switzerland demonstrates that it is able to describe the overall development of actual mortgage loss rates. In addition, we show potential applications of the model for different macroprudential instruments: stress tests, countercyclical buffer, and setting risk weights for mortgages with different loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios.

Propagation is analyzed with respect to the transmission of excessive volatility that is endogenously determined. The contagion process is discussed in the context of financial systems, foreign direct investments and trade. Implementing a vector autoregressive-multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (VAR-MGARCH) model, we show that country-specific turbulence in financial markets is able to create unanticipated financial contagion across countries. Diversified trade and financial relations decrease the risk of exposure to contagion from external markets. The world's largest economies, however, play a price-setter role, and diversification is of secondary importance. Asymmetric transmission of the empirically predicted contagion prevails in the latter case.","[Kilic, Erdem] MEF Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ulusoy, Veysel] Yeditepe Univ, Ticari Bilimler Fak, TR-34755 Atasehir, Turkey",MEF Universitesi; Yeditepe University,"Kilic, E (通讯作者)，MEF Univ, Dept Econ, Maslak Ayazaga Cad 4, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkey.",kilice@mef.edu.tr,"Library, MEF/O-1457-2019; Kilic, Erdem/JBS-4046-2023; Ulusoy, Veysel/V-3977-2017","Ulusoy, Veysel/0000-0001-7227-894X",,,,,31,5,5,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The comprehensive process of restructuring and reorganizing the process have led, in time, to emergence of new priority axis and key areas of intervention adapted to the real needs of the single European market. Whether aimed at developing the human resources, improving or creating the specific infrastructure or at fostering entrepreneurship, the Structural Funds have always pursued plugging in the development gaps at both regional and national level. In the depicted background, tourism appears as one of the priority areas for allocation of the European funding. Moreover, fostering entrepreneurship in tourism by allocating Structural Funds entails not only putting in place circumstances fostering establishment of new business entities, but also supporting any initiative which intends to enhance innovation and competitiveness of the existing companies. Further to the investigation of the current progress of the research in the industry, which relied on studies of both foreign and Romanian researchers, a niche has been articulated and become the topic of concern for this article. Thus, the main objective of the article is to determine the immediate effects of accessing the funds available under the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) for the tourism business environment, as a catalyst for entrepreneurship in the respective industry. Subsequent to researching the current economic context of tourism in terms of the specific indicators, a closer look was taken into the use of the Structural Funds under the ROP throughout the recently ended reporting period: 2007-2013. The data produced was correlated with the SPSS econometrics software. The key outputs include the degree and intensity of the influence of these financial instruments on the tourism business environment, in the shape of future trends, and are listed in the closing section of this article.","[Padurean, Mihaela Ana; Nica, Ana-Maria; Nistoreanu, Puiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Padurean, MA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaelapadurean@yahoo.fr,"Nica, Ana-Maria/IUQ-2106-2023; PADUREAN, ANA MIHAELA/AAY-5599-2020; Nistoreanu, Puiu/C-1021-2009","PADUREAN, ANA MIHAELA/0000-0002-6511-0185; Nistoreanu, Puiu/0000-0002-8369-7899; Nica, ANA-MARIA/0000-0002-5830-9428",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115, Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,30,19,19,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,180,194,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800012,0

The financial auditor is meant to be an entrepreneur, to take his destiny into his own hands, because, in order to be independent, a demand induced by the ethical code provides that he cannot work as an employee of his services' users. This paper proposes a research for identifying and presenting the entrepreneur's role in the performance growth in the financial audit. The main objective of the conducted research is to present an overview of the entrepreneurship environment, to identify opportunities and challenges faced by the entrepreneur involved in the financial auditing of the level of development reached by the auditing market in Romania, by analysing representative statistical indicators in the market development and financial management of the audit activity. The proposed research methodology focuses on the collection, processing and analysis of statistical data on entrepreneurship of financial audit activity, based on official data published by the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania (CAFR), and on the identification of the main factors leading to the development of supply and demand of financial auditing and of the shortcomings the financial audit contractor involved in his own surveys is facing. Being a fairly new regulated profession, I had the privilege to analyse the developments in the entrepreneurship activity of the financial audit market for the entire period of existence: 1999-2013, showing the dynamic structure of supply and demand of financial auditing, the development and characteristics of the business environment during the period under review, the specificity of the financial audit entrepreneurship and I could outline a sketch of the entrepreneur involved in the financial audit activity. The research results show that the number of financial auditors, individuals and legal entities, had experienced a continuous growth, reflecting on one hand the attraction for the new profession and, on the other hand the role of modelling highlighted of the new professions, especially, the effects of organizational or regulatory measures such as the introduction of the three years stage in 2002, or the ability to harness the social and economic entrepreneurial opportunities induced by the economic and financial crisis, which imposed the necessity of audit entities to be subject to restructuring, or else becoming insolvent. The major role of entrepreneurship in developing the financial audit activity in Romania is revealed by empowering entrepreneurs, auditors, able to contribute to the growth and diversification of demand, audits reaching from 197 in 2001 to 6,588 in 2013. The research analyses in the end the dynamics of performance in audit work by defining specific performance indicators which show, synthetically, the entrepreneur's role in the improvement of the financial audit activity, and the growth of its performance.","[Popescu, Cristina Raluca; Popescu, Veronica Adriana; Popescu, Gheorghe N.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Veronica Adriana] Commercial Acad Satu Mare, Satu Mare, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, CR (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",popescu_cr@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./T-8658-2019; Popescu, Gheorghe N./ABF-2624-2021","Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./0000-0002-5876-0550;","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific interdisciplinary research, doctoral and postdoctoral, in the economic, social and medical fields - EXCELIS, coordinator The Bucharest University of Economic Studies.",,31,14,15,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,228,246,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800015,0

Although the average change in pre-experiment confidence from session one to session two is close to zero, the dispersion in confidence increases. For those with moderate initial confidence, the change in confidence depends significantly on performance in session one. For those with high initial confidence, the change in confidence does not depend on performance, and the correlation between confidence prior to session two and confidence prior to session one is significantly higher than for those with neutral or low confidence. Subjects with high initial confidence also base their perception of post-experiment relative performance primarily on pre-experiment confidence, an effect not present in the moderate and low confidence groups.

Moreover, many researchers in psychology are increasingly interested in studying intentions to explain planned behaviors. However, remarkably, many researchers in various fields in business and management are using these theories to explain and interpret managerial dilemmas. The aim of this paper is to draw a theoretical framework to Lebanese researchers who are trying to measure and enhance the performance of public sector organizations, by combining the theory of planned behavior and the technology acceptance model.

Both models integrate the amount and likelihood of stochastic reserve outflows as a liability into the portfolio construction exercise. While the first model seeks to maximise the expected utility of the investment tranche, taking into account that any possible outflows would only be met with asset liquidation, the second model includes foreign borrowing as an option for the central bank to raise liquidity. As would be expected in practice, liquidation and borrowing costs are specified to grow in a non-linear way. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The location of Greece in the South East corner of the European Union and the Balkans places the country as an entry point of immigrant workers from a large number of countries with a significant portion of them originating from Balkan countries including Albania, Bulgaria and Romania. Historically, immigrant workers exhibit increased occupational accidents compared to the average national rate. In general, in periods of rapid economic growth the rate of occupational accidents may be increased and this was observed in Greece during the '90s. Unfortunately, after a period of rapid economic growth the Greek economy collapsed and this created a pressure to reduce labour cost and increase the percentage of short-term hired personnel. Under these conditions, immigrant workers may be frequently employed with lower wages, for short-term periods of time, with some of them been undeclared employees. According to the Greek national legislation, all occupational accidents are recorded and reported in the Ministry of Labour. Using these data we observed that in Greece, a significant portion of occupational accidents involve immigrant workers. The international experience on this subject indicates that several factors may contribute for the increased rate of occupational accidents of immigrant workers. For example, immigrant workers frequently are hired on a short-term basis and this can increase the occupational risk especially in the first days or weeks of their work. In fact, the occupational risk of both immigrants and native workers is reduced as work experience is increased. Another contributing factor is that immigrants are usually employed in low-skilled and labour intensive jobs that historically portray high occupational risks. Furthermore, a significant portion maybe immigrants with limited verbal and written Greek language communication skills, increasing in this way the probability of occupational accident occurrence. Possible measures to reduce the occupational risks of immigrant workers include the utilization of human resources management tools such as adequate training, reduced overtime and other health and safety initiatives (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Anastasiou, Sophia] TEI Cent Greece, Sch Business, Thiva 32000, Greece; [Siassiakos, Kostas] Supreme Council Civil Personnel Select, Athens 11523, Greece; [Filippidis, Kostas] Univ Macedonia, Dept Balkan Studies, Florina 53100, Greece; [Nathanailides, Cosmas] Sch Agr Food & Nutr Technol, Mesolongion 30200, Greece",,"Anastasiou, S (通讯作者)，TEI Cent Greece, Sch Business, Thiva 32000, Greece.",,"ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/AAC-1668-2020; Nathanailides, Cosmas/C-6650-2008; Nathanailides, Cosmas/IXN-5174-2023","Nathanailides, Cosmas/0000-0001-9215-4127; ANASTASIOU, SOPHIA/0000-0002-3874-5732",,,,,28,2,2,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2015,33.0,,,,,,226,233,,10.1016/S2212-5671(15)01708-6,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4FZ,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380846000019,0

We employ a comprehensive sample of M&As conducted by UK acquirers from 2000 to 2010, thus including a full cycle of peak and trough in M&A waves. We find that institutional investors increase the likelihood of an M&A to be a large, cross-border deal, opting for full control. Moreover, institutional ownership concentration and foreign institutional ownership increase the likelihood of cross-border M&As. In addition, we assess the influence of institutional shareholders' investment horizon and find that while investment horizon have a negative influence in encouraging cross-border M&As, the presence of long-term investors encourages larger M&As. Finally, even after controlling for the 2007-08 financial crisis the market reacts negatively to the announcement of cross-border M&As. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The article deals with the development of statistical characteristics of the level, variability and concentration in the given period, mentioning the changes in these characteristics in the course of the economic recession. Data for these calculations come from the official website of the Czech Statistical Office, namely the Percentages of employees by the band of gross monthly wages by sector and an information about the survey sample from Numbers of employees and their average gross monthly wages by sector and education. Data on the number of employees in the individual sectors studied come from the table Employment and Wages, all for the years 2003-2013. Data from the Czech Statistical Office were completed data from official website of the Eurostat and by individual data from Trexima Company. Descriptive characteristics were computed from data and theoretical probability models were constructed. There are three-parametric lognormal curves with parameters estimated using the method of L-moments. Three-parametric lognormal distribution is the most common used probabilistic distribution in modeling the wage and income distributions.

The importance of accurate credit risk quantification is growing nowadays in global economy just like in local economies. CreditMetrics approach is designed to measure the risk of credit loss caused by changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers. Loss does not occur only in the case of counterparty's default, but also upon its transition into worse rating category. The output of this model, however, is the entire distribution function of portfolio value. We will present application of this method for single bond. For this purpose we will use analytical method. We will use methods of formal logic such as: analysis, synthesis, deduction and comparison. The result will be comprehensive overview of CreditMetrics results under the conditions of local economy. We will also mention test results of various renowned agencies, which reflect the accuracy of this model. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The banking system, on the one hand, still fails to sufficiently understanding on these projects, on the innovative character and the work model with intangible assets. On the other hand, the stock market is inaccessible for this type of investments. Investment funds are too focused on liability and indicial management. The government makes efforts to solve the problem of financing SME manufacturing, but there are no tools and no markets or appropriate institutional architecture. In this paper we propose not only new tools based on innovative mix of private management and governmental support of a new type of financial public-private partnership (PPP), but a way that creates a strong support of the markets and changing public perception about investments in capital markets. It first examines the possibility of creating a tool as closed end fund for SME manufacturing, the initial participation of the government will be 50%. It could be attracted foreign Venture Capital Fund (VCF) or Private Equity Fund (PEF) that already exist on the market and are interested in portfolio diversification. This fund can turn into semi-open in the background periodically be admitted new entries private. This fund can turn into semi-open fund in which periodically will be admitted new private entries. The fund may provide loans or, in a further development, may provide venture capital or private equity funding and at least we can start creating a framework for these new tools. Based on this proposal it is also possible to analyze another type of fund focused on co-financing mechanisms dedicated for national and European projects. In this case the main interest is to support liquidity management, consulting, to support warranties or windows settlement for different project phases.

Of course, main function of remittances is to ensure minimum conditions of existence of the households that generate real living conditions of the migrant family.

Our model also accounts for the fact that the pollen and nectar collected by bees on crops are limiting resources for both bee growth and honey production. We argue that diminishing returns to foraging by bees is a central constraint of the economic problem of beekeeping and that availability of forage plays an important role in determining the abundance of honey bees. Furthermore, we show how the behaviors of individual beekeepers are aggregated through markets for bees and characterize the response of the beekeeping industry to changes in honey prices, winter losses, and other factors. Our model sets the bases for an empirical approach to estimate the relative contributions of different biological and economic factors to changes in honey bee populations in the United States over the past 60 years.","[Champetier, A.; Sumner, D.

At the same time, Professional tape recorder is becoming more and more expensive. How to use limited conditions for high quality audio recording file became the most people of a kind of expectations. When choosing recording products, people may form such a view: the higher the price, the better the recording quality; and vice vesa. Therefore, when we buy recording products, usually we are willing to pay a higher price for professional recording devices. Actually, the recording quality of cheap recorders is comparable to that of professional recorders if we use the correct recording method. Using waste computer homemade tape recorder, Can be used for high quality recordings? To this, Our objective of homemade recorder test, Subjective evaluation on audio effect. To prove that the homemade recorder is able to perform high quality recordings. This study used again for homemade recorder and waste resources. By using a professional recorder (744T) and its homemade recorder, the Educational Technology Department of Chongqing Normal University completed the recording and post-production for the national classic public courses several times. Both recorders are up to the national standard for all audio indexes. We tested and analyzed the performance of the homemade recorder, which proved it could be used for high quality recording. An international-recognized evaluation for devices related to visual or audio sense should be a comprehensive evaluation covering both subjective and objective views. In this study, when we evaluate the performance of the recorders, we mainly use objective tests. Therein, the subjective evaluation means grading the recording effect of different recorders through closed-eye listening, while the objective tests means testing the performance indexes of recorders by using related devices and instruments. [1] The homemade recorder is a Pentium four computer with a audio card, and its recording is achieved through a audio software COOLEDIT. The operating principle is as follows: the audio card converts an analog audio signal into a digital audio signal, and then the audio-edit software COOLEDIT is used for recording and storing the audio in the hard drive. The homemade recorder is based on Windows operating platform, and it can do the post-editing for stored digital audio signals. Thant means the homemade recorder has the function of recording and editing. [2] This objective test covers the tests for frequency response, distortion factor and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of recorders. During the tests. [3] we only change the test objects and other conditions are kept constant. We use a hard-drive based recorder (American Sound devices 744t) as the reference object. Featured portability and high-quality recording, this recorder is a fashionable and well-known one in the market, but its price is over 30,000 RMB. In order to prove that the homemade recorder can be used for high-quality recording, we will compare these two recorders to minimize the test deviation.

The new era of milk output without quota constraints will result in both opportunities and challenges for the EU dairy industry. The opportunities will arise from the expanding global dairy market. The challenges will involve the ability of the EU dairy industry to achieve international competitiveness in servicing the increased global demand for dairy products. The paper examines these challenges and opportunities in detail. This paper will explore these issues with a primary focus on the prospects for the EU dairy industry over the next decade.","[Donnellan, Trevor] TEAGASC, Agr Econ & Farm Surveys Dept, Athenry H65 R718, Galway, Ireland; [Keane, Michael] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork T12 YN60, Ireland",Teagasc; University College Cork,"Donnellan, T (通讯作者)，TEAGASC, Agr Econ & Farm Surveys Dept, Athenry H65 R718, Galway, Ireland.",trevor.donnellan@teagasc.ie; m.keane@ucc.ie,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,5,19,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600001,0

In this paper we focus on the argumentation of Acemoglu et al. (2005) who state that macroeconomic policies explain economic growth since they can be understood as proxies for institutions. The object of the paper is then to support the idea that macroeconomic policies, in particular, fiscal policy in our case influences the economic growth in particular institutional settings in the EU. In detail, regressions augmented with the interactions between fiscal policy tools and institutional settings are used to verify whether the policy influences economic growth directly or whether institutions are the driving forces giving the direction to fiscal policy. Moreover, employing the panel data allows for the explanation of both cross-country differences in economic growth as well as of the evolution of economic growth over time in these countries. We conclude that institutional settings together with fiscal policy matter and are more influential to economic growth than fiscal policy itself.","[Grochova, Ladislava Issever] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Grochová, LI (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ladislava.grochova@mendelu.cz,"Grochová, Ladislava Issever/AAE-9065-2021; Issever Grochova, Ladislava/E-6841-2013","Grochová, Ladislava Issever/0000-0002-9983-4077;",,,,,21,0,0,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,270,277,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300029,0

Using 276 firm year observations of Malaysian listed companies over three years, 2009 to 2011, the result shows that debt ratio is negatively and significantly related to profitability. The finding suggests that profitable firms depend more on equity as their main financing option.

Currently China's new poverty alleviation strategy has been focusing on the 11+3 undeveloped poverty stricken areas. These areas face frequent natural disasters, poor living conditions and fragile ecological environment. Risk shocks, vulnerability and the rural household poverty are closely related in such areas. Risk shocks cause rural household poverty, and the poor households become more vulnerable, leading to an interaction of vulnerability and poverty in these areas. This paper theoretically analyzes the interaction of vulnerability and poverty in the undeveloped poverty stricken areas, and through the field survey in these poor areas, it measures the vulnerability to poverty of rural households. Then it explores the poverty factors in such areas, especially such risk shocks as natural disasters and dread disease. It also summarizes vulnerability characteristics in these areas. On the basis of theoretical and empirical analysis, the paper gives suggestions on the risk management strategy of the rural households. It puts forward that not only formal risk coping mechanism such as risk warning in advance, risk mitigation, commercial insurance and social security, but also informal risk coping mechanisms such as risk pooling inside the social safety network should be considered.","[Han Jinmian; Wang Jiaqi] NW Univ Xian, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710127, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Han, JM (通讯作者)，NW Univ Xian, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.",jinmianh@nwu.edu.cn; xidawjq@stumail.nwu.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,330,343,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500022,0

MMFs proved to be a source of considerable instability during the financial crisis of 2007-09, resulting in extraordinary government support to help stabilize the funding of global financial institutions. In light of the problems that emerged during the crisis, a number of MMF reforms have been proposed, which are analyzed in this paper. The paper assumes that the main goal of MMF reform is safeguarding global financial stability. In light of this goal, reforms should reduce the ex ante incentives for MMFs to take excessive risk and increase the ex post resilience of MMFs to system-wide runs. The analysis suggests that requiring MMFs to have subordinated capital buffers could generate significant financial stability benefits. Subordinated capital provides MMFs with loss absorption capacity, lowering the probability that an MMF suffers losses large enough to trigger a run, and reduces incentives to take excessive risks. Other reform alternatives based on market forces, such as converting MMFs to a floating net asset value, may be less effective in protecting financial stability. The analysis sheds light on the fundamental tensions inherent in regulating the shadow banking system.","[Hanson, Samuel G.; Sunderam, Adi] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Scharfstein, David S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Finance & Banking, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Hanson, SG (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,IMF; De Nederlandsche Bank,IMF; De Nederlandsche Bank,"Samuel G.

However, if the organisation provided necessary support to the employee the effect of bullying could be mitigated. The paper examines these issues in selected Malaysian organisations. A sample of 231 employees representing different industry, size, gender, age, experience and job position responded to a self-rated questionnaire which measured the study variables, namely workplace bullying, psychological strain, self-rated job performance, and organisational support. Result indicated that nearly 14 % employees faced bullying incidents either weekly or daily. Such incidents resulted in higher psychological strain and lower job performance.

Fixed strike Asian options are type of exotic options, whose special feature is that payoff is calculated from the difference of average market price and strike price for call options and vice versa for the put options. Methods of stochastic analysis are used to determine deltas and gammas of Asian options. Asian options are cheaper than vanilla options and therefore they are more suitable for portfolio creation. On the other hand their deltas are also smaller as well as profits. That means that they are also less risky and more suitable for hedging. Results, conducted on chosen commodity, confirm better feasibility of Asian options compering with vanilla options in sense of gamma hedging.","[Hruska, Juraj] Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hruska, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",206887@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,321,330,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000036,0

However, given the algorithmic nature of modern securities trading, frequently used parametric volatility models should be used with great caution when applied on high frequency data. Modelling volatility in high frequency data is fairly complex since such data contains a disruptive volatility component, which only occurs in this kind of data and is not observable in lower frequency data. This phenomenon is usually called market microstructure noise. It is mostly caused by bid ask bounce, so its presence is not so significant in assets with lower spreads. This paper focuses on the comparison of two approaches and simulations to identify market microstructure noise and derive optimal samples for measuring volatility. These tests are implemented on the high frequency trading data from the German Stock Exchange. Our paper provides high frequency data optimal sampling solutions for risk managers and active investors.","[Hruska, Juraj; Deev, Oleg] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hruska, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",206887@mail.muni.cz; oleg@mail.muni.cz,"Deev, Oleg/G-8486-2013",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,211,217,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200029,0

It is simple to use and significantly outperforms other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. The steepness of the yield curve should be an excellent indicator of a possible future economic activity. A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow real growth the near term. This paper aims to analyse the dependence between slope of the yield curve and an economic activity of EU-15 between the years 2000 and 2013. The slope of the yield curve can be measured as the yield spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and sovereign 3-month bonds. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is by GDP growth, taken quarterly. The results showed that the best predictive lag of spread is a lag of four and five quarters. The theory says that it should be lag of four quarters. The results presented also confirm that 10-year and 3-month yield spread has significant predictive power for real GDP growth after financial crisis. These findings can be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity.","[Hvozdenska, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hvozdenská, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",174974@mail.muni.cz,"Hvozdenska, Jana/AAA-8859-2021","Hvozdenska, Jana/0000-0003-4379-7120",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,253,260,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300027,0

To this aim, the article will discuss the relationship between social economy and tourism.

The GFC revealed that there are important interactions between the central bank (CB) monetary policy aimed at price stability and financial stability. ECB affects individual national economies using its strategies and instruments. Using especially interest rates makes monetary policy expansive or restrictive. For every country, belonging to euro area, has this policy different implications.

It draws upon the analysis and results of the 14_23079S Measuring Corporate Sustainability Performance in Selected Sectors project of the Czech Science Foundation solved at the Faculty of Business and Management of the Mendel University in Brno. The purpose of this paper is to provide an optimal set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on two international standard frameworks: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and its guidelines GRI 4 and the guideline KPIs for ESG 3.0 which was published by the DVFA Society of Investment Professionals in Germany in conjunction with the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS). Four sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, social and governance) are covered, making it thus possible to adequately evaluate sustainability performance in Czech breweries. Each dimension consists of a set of KPIs which identify both the strengths and the weaknesses of the given brewery. Utilizing the previously mentioned GRI and DVFA sustainability performance frameworks will help us in determining the risks and opportunities, as well as in improving the brewery management systems, benchmarking and goal-setting.","[Kasem, Edward] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kasem, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",edward.kasem@mendelu.cz,"Hrebicek, Jiri/A-4556-2010; Faldik, Oldrich/AAA-4872-2019; Trenz, Oldrich/L-5219-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,367,376,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000041,0

Next, respondents pointed to the acquisition of knowledge from the environment and to the sharing of knowledge with others.

From the results are evident the following conclusions. The estimates indicate that public expenditures on education have the highest positive impact on tax capacity on average. That is, the more educated people can better understand the relationship between publicly provided goods and taxation. Also government debt has positive effect on tax capacity because the government uses the tax revenue to repay the debt and its interest. On the other hand the effect of inflation is negative. That is the inflation can reduce the real value of tax revenues.

Often a solution is to strive for an open process where the target-cost of a project is set later after a joint development phase involving an owner and a selected team. Parties enter into a target-cost contract which means risk sharing and leads to taking each other's views into account better than normally. Cost transparency is expected to ensure efficiency in direct costs. Yet, the same approach may not be applicable to service providers' fees, i.e. overhead and profit. That is why some public owners have resorted to competition where fees are tendered and used in team selection along with capability. In that case, the structuring of fees may have a decisive impact on incentivising the service providers to strive for an efficient target-cost and, eventually, a successful project. This paper aims at examining the appropriateness and feasibility of such an approach in ensuring the efficiency of a project based on the experiences drawn from a unique road tunnel construction project in Finland that adheres to the practice.

Eclecticism in the respective scientific discourse is significant. The term leadership is being accompanied by various adjectives like narcissistic, destructive, toxic, dark, bad, dysfunctional, Machiavellian, or self-protective. Confusion of terms contributes to the development of concepts that mutually overlap to a large extend, which does not benefit to clarification of the respective concept or to subsequent application of related connotations in managerial praxis. In this context, we explore influential conceptions of unethical leadership and based on their critical analysis we specify several theoretical problems that are not reflected adequately in current scientific discourse. Deriving from this analytical inquiry, we propose a new conceptualization of unethical leadership that aims to bridge relevant concepts and to overcome their drawbacks. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This Regulation is known as the Regulation eIDAS. It was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 September 2014 and the core part of it shall apply from 1 July 2016. In spite of the fact that the implementing Acts have not been adopted yet, some specific impacts can be already predicted. The paper compares electronic authenticity institutes established by current Czech Electronic Signature Act and the Regulation eIDAS by means of legal analysis. Sequentially, there is shown that at least 47 Czech Acts will be affected by this Regulation. The paper also shows, by means of induction method, that implementation of the Regulation eIDAS affects almost all legal processes, information systems implemented and used by public bodies and a lot of processes performed by public bodies.

As donations mainly flow to provinces with high emigration rates, they do not reach less developed Philippine provinces.

The major findings of this research which uses the actuarial method to build calculation model are listed as follows: (1) participate in urban and rural residents endowment insurance is the rational decision making in the existing fiscal subsidy mechanism;(2) the current payment incentive mechanism motivates young and middle-aged residents to pay the fees, but it cannot motivate the insured to choose the high level insurance; (3) Fiscal subsidy and pension benefits are relatively fair as a whole. Fiscal subsidy have income redistribution effect, but not In the pay cost standard part. Consequently, the fiscal subsidy mechanism needs to be optimized by establishing the normal adjustment mechanism of the basic pension, replacing the fixed subsidy by the excess regressive proportion subsidy, establishing the standard adjustment mechanism of individual account interest.","[Liu Haiying; Li Jiangjing] Ocean Univ China, Sch Law & Polit, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China,"Li, JJ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Law & Polit, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",lijaingjing122@126.com,"Lin, Lin/JTU-1595-2023",,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,533,544,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500036,0
