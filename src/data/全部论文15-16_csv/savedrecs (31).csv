We also observe that the influence of reinsurance and other financial variables on insurers' growth in product-market share differs across lines of insurance business. We conclude that reinsurance performs an important strategic function in insurance markets through its impact on product-market outcomes in competitive insurance markets. Additionally, we find that leverage is the most important factor affecting product-market share at the aggregate business level of the insurance firm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandated that the definition of a dependent include young adults up to age 26, regardless of student status. Many states have passed similar mandates. The newly-acquired dependent status of non-students may encourage some young adults to avoid college.

Using the Generalized Pareto Distribution for the return innovations, we use a GARCH model for the conditional market return components of major stock markets covering the U.S., France, Germany and Japan. Testing for fat-tails and tail index equality, we find that overnight return innovations exhibit significant tail risk, while intraday innovations do not. We illustrate this volatility versus tail risk trade-off based on conditional Value-at-Risk calculations. Our results show that overnight downside market risk is composed of a moderate volatility risk component and a significant tail risk component. We conclude that market participants face different intraday versus overnight risk profiles and that a risk assessment based on volatility only will severely underestimate overnight downside risk.

Second, those FBBs that are net users (suppliers) of internal funding are found to have stronger (lower) loan growth than their peers in the face of liquidity risk. Third, these drivers of cross-sectional differences in loan growth become not important for the risk transmission when banks access official lending facilities.

Our analysis draws upon two large unbalanced panels of 6634 enterprises in Germany and 14,841 enterprises in the Netherlands over the period 2000-2008, considering five manufacturing and services industries that differ in the level of technological intensity. Industries in the Netherlands are characterized by a larger average proportion of high-skilled employees and industries in Germany by a more unequal distribution of human capital intensity. In Germany, average innovation performance is higher in all industries, except for low-technology manufacturing, and in the Netherlands the innovation performance distributions are more dispersed. In both countries, we observe nonlinearities in the productivity effects of investing in product innovation in the majority of industries. Frontier firms enjoy the highest returns to product innovation whereas for process innovation the most negative returns are observed in the best-performing enterprises of most industries. We find that in both countries the returns to human capital increase with proximity to the technological frontier in industries with a low level of technological intensity. Strikingly, a negative complementarity effect between human capital and proximity to the technological frontier is observed in knowledge-intensive services, which is most pronounced for the Netherlands. Suggestive evidence suggests an interpretation of a winner-takes-all market in knowledge-intensive services.","[Bartelsman, Eric; Dobbelaere, Sabien] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric; Dobbelaere, Sabien] Tinbergen Inst TIA, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric; Dobbelaere, Sabien] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Petersy, Bettina] MaCCI Mannheim Ctr Competit & Innovat, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Petersy, Bettina] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Zurich,"Dobbelaere, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.j.bartelsman@vu.nl; sabien.dobbelaere@vu.nl; b.peters@zew.de,"Bartelsman, Eric/ABE-2895-2021","Dobbelaere, Sabien/0000-0001-9521-4893; Bartelsman, Eric/0000-0001-7099-8513",SEEK (Strenghtening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies) research program,SEEK (Strenghtening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies) research program,Financial support from the SEEK (Strenghtening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies) research program is gratefully acknowledged.,,126,26,26,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

A matched pair analysis is used to construct event-control pairs to determine the relative risk of crash, injury, and fatality. Winter precipitation is associated with a 19% increase in traffic crashes and a 13% increase in injuries compared to dry conditions. The type of winter precipitation (snowfall vs. freezing rain, ice pellets, or sleet) had no significant impact on the relative risk of crash. The relative risk of crash was significantly higher during the evening (1800-2359 local time) than during other times of the day. More intense precipitation led to increased relative risk of crash and injury compared to less intense precipitation. Relative risk of crash, injury, or fatality was not significantly higher during the first three winter precipitation events of the year as compared to subsequent events. The relative risk of both winter precipitation crash and injury showed no significant trend during the 1998-2008 period. Sensitivity of U.S. cities to winter precipitation varies from city to city in a manner that is not easily explained. Future research will be required to determine which safety interventions are most effective in each city and revise or expand safety programs appropriately. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, conditional on breaks in the conditional mean, the procedure identifies distinct structural breaks in the volatility of a given set of countries. A further structural break test applied to the correlation matrix identifies and then dates the potential contagion mechanisms. As a third element, the STP tests for the distinctiveness of the break dates previously found. As a result of using multi-dimensional data, the STP has high testing power and is able to locate the dates of contagion more precisely. The application to European long-term interest rates shows that immediate contagion from Greece does not take place, but the dynamic spillovers are shown to increase after controlling for breaks in the different model parameters. For other countries we find evidence of both contagion and flight-to-quality mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, utilizing a rich database containing nearly 5500 commercial banks from 70 countries (among which, 22 are IT) for the period 1998-2012, this paper argues that on average, inflation targeting national banking systems (i) are more stable; (ii) possess sounder systemically important banks; and (iii) are less distressed than (or at least as distressed as) other banks during periods of global liquidity shortages. Our results are robust to a series of tests, such as when we compare countries with the same legal origins or control for the delegation of bank supervision responsibility to bodies other than the central bank.

In our model, each transformed-gamma distributed underlying asset depends on two terms: a idiosyncratic term and a systematic term, where the latter is the same for all underlying assets and has a direct impact on their correlation structure. Given our distributional assumptions and the existence of a representative agent with a standard utility function, we apply equilibrium arguments and provide sufficient conditions for obtaining preference-free contingent claim pricing equations. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by providing examples of preference-free contingent claim pricing models. Multivariate pricing models are of particular interest when payoffs depend on two or more underlying assets, such as crack and crush spread options, options to exchange one asset for another, and options with a stochastic strike price in general.","[Vitiello, Luiz] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Rebelo, Ivonia] London Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business, London EC2M 6SQ, England",University of Essex; London Metropolitan University,"Vitiello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",lrviti@essex.ac.uk,,"Vitiello, Luiz/0000-0002-5606-1940",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

The estimates of the model provide support of the consumption smoothing hypothesis. The paper shows that the real term structure is spanned by two mean-reverting state variables. The mean-reverting property of these variables can consistently explain the forecasting ability of the short-term real rate and term spread to forecast future consumption growth rate, over different horizons ahead. Although the risks associated with changes in these variables are both priced in the market, they are not volatile enough to obscure the information of the real term structure about future real consumption growth.

Controlling for time-invariant features of each newspaper and of each company - and for ownership links between companies and newspapers - we show that newspaper coverage of a company is positively and significantly related with advertising expenditure by that company on that newspaper. The magnitude of this correlation is quite large: when controlling for ownership links, a standard deviation increase in monthly ads expenditure (i.e. 75,000 euros) is on average associated with 8 additional articles per month mentioning that company. We also find that coverage of a company is higher the day after a press release, but especially in newspapers where more ads are purchased. This result on press releases is robust to controlling for time invariant features of each company-newspaper pair, i.e. for (company x newspaper) fixed effects. Moreover, coverage is correlated with past day absolute return and trading volume, and this relationship appears to be steeper for those newspapers where more ads are purchased, especially in the case of positive returns.

More than one-third of the volatility of housing prices is driven by housing preference shocks. The volatility of residential investment is mainly driven by housing technology shocks with more than one-half variance contribution. Monetary shocks explain 12-32% of variance in housing prices and residential investments. However, the contribution of monetary factors appears more important in the 1990s and less important in the 2000s. We find that two observables with Chinese characteristics capture part of the housing preference shocks.

These stocks may be the result of the herding behaviors of individual investors who account for over 80% of investors in China's stock markets. Second, negative weekly returns increase in trading the constituent stocks of DJ30 and FTSE100 because returns increase considerably on golden-cross days as a result of stock price overreaction. These results remain robust by concerning investors' risk aversion, and even high risk aversion as investors suffer losses.

Household characteristics, including age, tenure, and income and local area characteristics, such as unemployment, are associated with differences between beliefs and prices. The extent of overvaluation is positively associated with household spending, leverage and risky-asset holdings. Over the housing cycle, homeowner valuations appear less volatile than sale prices and are backward-looking; homeowners also learn from past 'errors'.

We use a detailed employer-employee database constructed with four comprehensive datasets of French manufacturing firms over the period 2002-2007, in order to analyze changes in the workforce composition in terms of skills and tasks. To deal with endogeneity issues, we propose an IV strategy where the level of infrastructure and GDP per capita in the host countries are used as instruments. The fixed effect results show that FDI to low-income countries raises significantly the share of executives and reduces the share of blue-collar workers in company workforces in France. Outward FDI to high-income countries affects negatively the share of workers performing non-routine manual tasks.

Using a probit model to forecast the National Bureau of Economic Research expansion and recession classification, we assess the incremental information content of state-level employment growth over a commonly used set of national-level predictors. As state-level data adds a large number of predictors to the model, we employ a Bayesian model averaging procedure to construct forecasts. Based on a variety of forecast evaluation metrics, we find that including state-level employment growth substantially improves nowcasts and very short-horizon forecasts of the business cycle phase.

Relying on the Young Lives dataset, we find that indigenous children do not limit their aspirations when compared to non-indigenous children with the same socio-economic background. Findings suggest that they do not have internalized racial schemas about their opportunities. However, aspirations are a channel of inequality persistence between ethnic groups, exacerbating the effect of socioeconomic status on educational achievement. Indeed, socioeconomic status predicts the level of aspiration which in turn impacts progress in language acquisition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's estimate of $9.2 million is based on labor market estimates of VSL. This article examines whether there are any significant differences in labor market estimates of the VSL by the nature of the fatality, utilizing two different approaches that distinguish between fatalities resulting from transportation events and vehicle-related sources based on the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data. The labor market estimates of VSL generalize across transport and non-transport contexts so that it is appropriate to use labor market estimates of VSL to value the benefits of transport regulations.

Numerous researchers have investigated whether or not the use of brokers as well as various broker actions, broker characteristics, and broker/seller legal relationships affect market outcomes in the form of price and/or, time-on-the-market effects. We extend this line of research by considering price, time-on-market, and probability of sale effects in relation to four specific broker strategies: public open houses, broker open houses, MLS virtual tours, and MLS photographs.

Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.

Travel distance is universally important for school cycling and is reliant amongst related home and school spatial proximity factors on a student's choice of schools. This paper, primarily based on school students' travel data extracted from the 2009 South East Queensland Household Travel Survey (SEQHTS), examines comparative school cycling travel patterns, school catchment choices and the significant analytical determinants of cycling mode choices from within an urban regional Australian context. Students' choice of a school external to that located within their designated State school catchment zone was associated with household attributes of parent/guardian employment location, number of income earners and ownership of private vehicles coupled with State school and catchment attributes. Noteworthy variations in school travel distances and modal splits were allied with school catchment choices. Adolescent male students from two parent households owning fewer than two cars and more than two bicycles, with parents/guardians commuting using non-motorised travel modes and resident in Census Collection Districts with conducive cycling environments, contributed largely to the one-way bi-directional primary and secondary school cycling mode shares. This prevalent student cyclist profile indicates the need for enhancements in student school cycling participation, through policies addressing both the spatial (built) and social environment which impact students' personal and traffic safety coupled with utilitarian cycling image enhancements. Concerted efforts to bolster cycling amongst student segments with current low cycling participation inclusive of females, students from single parent households and those with adequate access to private motorised travel modes may be necessary to further enhance school cycling mode shares. The paper makes a case for individualised targeted travel interventions informed by segregated mode choice determinant analysis for respective primary and secondary school types and directions of school travel.

The institutional setting in which ports are now embedded requires methods of analysis that go beyond those traditionally applied in transport geography, but port geography research has not embraced critical, radical or relational geographies. Thus, questions relating to the new conceptions of space and networks created through the corporatisation of the industry remain unanswered. This paper examines prevailing conceptualisations of space in port geography and elaborates the case for a smooth space conceptualisation. In doing so, it draws on two theoretical traditions of the spatial impacts of capital accumulation, beginning with Marx and Harvey to demonstrate how ports represent an exemplar of the inherently unstable spatial fix of mobile capital, then turning to the concept of smooth space introduced by Deleuze and Guattari. Using these concepts, the paper reflects on the production of capitalist smooth space in the global port operations sector, in which a handful of multinational corporations manage portfolios of major ports across the globe. The result is an inherent contradiction between a port's embeddedness in its local setting and regional hinterland and the expanding global corporatocracy driving its operational strategy. This paper argues, therefore, that port devolution and development cannot be understood in the absence of a critique of their capitalist context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparing policies that are constrained by the same aggregate pollution target level, the productive life of capital is longer under dynamic relative standards, as the variable cost of pollution imposed on aging capital is lower. As a result, the absolute level of output from the industry is generally higher under dynamic relative standards than under taxes. The results also show, under reasonable assumptions, that the pollution goal will be achieved using cleaner technologies under dynamic relative standards.

We argue that lying in professional contexts share three characterizing features: (1) the gain from the dishonest behavior is uncertain, (2) the harm that lying may cause to the other party is only indirect and (3) lies are more indirect lies by action or written statements. Conducted as a field experiment with a heterogenous group of participants during a University Open House Day, our gumball-machine-experiment provides field evidence on how preferences for lying are shaped in situations typically found in professional contexts which we consider to be particularly prone to lying behavior compared to other contexts. As a key innovation, our experimental design allows measuring exact levels of cheating behavior under anonymous conditions. We find clean evidence that cheating is prevalent across all sub groups and that more than 32% of the population cheats for their own gain. However, an analysis of the cheating rates with respect to highest educational degree and professional status reveals that students cheat more than non-students. This finding warrants a careful interpretation of generalizing laboratory findings with student subjects about the prevalence of cheating in the population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, discrete choice models have begun to integrate social context into its framework. Social influence, the process of having one's behavior be affected by others, has been one approach to this integration. This paper provides a review and discussion of the incorporation of social influence into discrete choice models with specific application in travel behavior analysis. The discussion begins with a generalized framework to describe choice models of social influence. This framework focuses on the behavioral microfoundations of social influence and choice by separating the social influence mechanism from the source of its influence and by explicitly acknowledging the role of the social network in the model structure. This contrasts with prior work that focused on the measurement of contextual, endogenous, and correlated effects. Then, the state of the art in travel behavior research is reviewed using a taxonomy based on the generalized framework with research performed in sociology, social psychology, and social network analysis. The discussion then shifts to the importance of understanding the motivations for social influence, and the formation and structure of social networks are explored. Additionally, the challenges of collecting data for social influence studies are mentioned and the paper concludes with a look at the challenges in the field and areas for future research.

We use matching techniques to control for the endogenous location of parks. We find that parks' effects on wages are, on average, positive and significant, but the magnitudes vary. Wages close to parks are higher for local workers living near tourist entrances. However, there is no robust evidence of positive effects for those close to parks but far away from tourist entrances. With our individual-level data, we also show that the positive effects on local households might not be as large as suggested by previous studies that use aggregated level data containing both local and immigrant households.","[Robalino, Juan] Univ Costa Rica, Dept Econ, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Robalino, Juan] CATIE, Environm Dev Initiat, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Villalobos, Laura] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Universidad Costa Rica; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of Gothenburg,"Robalino, J (通讯作者)，Univ Costa Rica, Dept Econ, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica.",robalino@catie.ac.cr; Laura.Villalobos@economics.gu.se,,"Robalino, Juan/0000-0003-1450-7382",,,,,36,41,43,2,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Underlying the aggregate evidence of such dramatic growth, one observes a large, albeit shrinking, intra-sectoral heterogeneity coupled with an even more important process of learning and knowledge accumulation. A major process of both catching-up and dying out among the least efficient ones occurs. Furthermore, we explore the effect of the characteristics of firms according to the ownership and governance structure upon the productivity distributions, highlighting the importance of the transformation of domestic firms as drivers of technical learning. In essence, China's fast catching-up process entails more of learning and creative restructuring of domestic firms rather than sheer creative destruction and even less so a multinational corporation-led drive.","[Yu, Xiaodan; Dosi, Giovanni; Nuvolari, Alessandro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Lei, Jiasu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Tsinghua University,"Yu, XD (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",x.yu@sssup.it; giovannidosi@sssup.it; leijiasu@163.com; alessandro.nuvolari@sssup.it,"Nuvolari, Alessandro/F-3151-2011; DOSI, GIOVANNI/B-9587-2014","Nuvolari, Alessandro/0000-0002-7275-4827; DOSI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-0126-9349",,,,,57,32,32,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The overview of main developments indicates that, in broad terms, most parts of the sector have expanded considerably but that the needs remain acute for further expansion and for attention to the maintenance of existing facilities. Demand for infrastructure is high, especially since the regulated prices set for infrastructure services are often low. Access is often difficult, however, because of shortages of infrastructure, and quality is often unsatisfactory because of poor maintenance and indifferent management. These problems of access are exacerbated by the regulation of prices. This overview also points to the markedly different performances of industries in which pro-competitive policies have been applied and those in which more traditional policies of close regulation have restricted the operation of markets.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"McCawley, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,55,22,23,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

If immigration is allowed to complement the inflow of foreign capital, urban rent rises by more. This extra rise in rent aids in appeasing owners of capital specific to local traditional industries who else become worse off as FDI flows in. The article's model may help give a simple alternative explanation of why urban centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Dublin or many cities on China's Eastern coast have received so much more FDI per capita. These cities could draw on a nearby pool of extra labor that - by driving rents up and keeping wages down - may have been decisive in the political struggle over whether to let foreign direct investors in.","Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Dascher, K (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",,,,European Commission [ERBFMRXCT980215],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"I have greatly benefited from stimulating comments by Frank Barry, John FitzGerald, Dermot Leahy, Peter Neary, Stephen Pavelin, Tony Venables, Frank Walsh, and two anonymous referees.

The changing nature of financial institution risk,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Banking risk; Financial institution; Systemic risk; Catastrophic risk,GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET-INFORMATION; INFERENCE; MODELS; POLICY; BANKS,"Six years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the question of whether the U.S. financial system has become less risky remains unanswered. On the one side, new regulations including Dodd-Frank and Basel III have made improvements by requiring higher bank capital, and financial institutions themselves have reduced risk-taking activities. on the other side, it has been argued that the fundamental risks remained and the efforts of regulators and politicians were simply rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. (Baily and Elliott, 2013) This paper highlights the changing nature of financial institution risk from 2005 to 2011. It finds that while these institutions have become less risky individually after the crisis, the financial market has become more vulnerable to systemic contagion. The causal inference that the crisis and the post-crisis legislation have gradually changed the nature of financial institution risk is drawn from a quasi-experimental design. This finding suggests that the ever more integrated financial system might experience more synchronized contractions in future crises, providing empirical support for the proposals of the inter-bank collective regulation of banks by Acharya (2009) in addition to the intra-bank collective regulations as in Froot and Stein (1998) and BIS (1996, 1999).

Our results suggest that trade credit complements the formal finance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at the local level. Provincial banking development in Italy increases the provision of trade credit by SMEs and stimulates the redistribution of loans via trade credit. However, cooperative banking reduces the use of trade credit at the local level. Evidence shows that lower levels of provincial banking development are linked with a stronger decline in trade credit at the start of the global financial crisis. We also find that SMEs in provinces with industrial districts use more trade credit. Our results confirm that local differences in banking development and the trade credit policy of SMEs within countries matter, adding to earlier findings that the provision of trade credit is complementary to the development of financial institutions at the country level.","[Deloof, Marc] Univ Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Deloof, Marc] Antwerp Management Sch, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [La Rocca, Maurizio] Univ Calabria, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Calabria,"Deloof, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",marc.deloof@uantwerpen.be; mlarocca@unical.it,"La Rocca, Maurizio/L-3143-2019","La Rocca, Maurizio/0000-0002-2097-2865; Deloof, Marc/0000-0002-6314-5528",,,,,47,46,47,1,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our analysis reveals large differences in the age- and gender-specific level and type of production activities across selected European countries and identifies possible strategies to adjust age- specific economic behaviour to an ageing population. The cross-country differences in economic dependency of children and elderly persons are largely determined by the age at which people enter, respectively exit, the labour market. The ability of the working age population to support children and elderly persons in turn is strongly influenced by the participation of women in paid work. We also provide a measure for the age- specific production and consumption in form of unpaid household work. The inclusion of unpaid household work leads to a decrease of the gender differences in production activities and indicates that the working age population supports children and elderly persons not only through monetary transfers but also through services produced by unpaid work (e.g. childcare, cooking, cleaning...). Given the available data, we cannot distinguish the age profile of consumption by gender and have to assume - in case of unpaid work - that each member of the household consumes the same. Hence, our results have to be regarded as a first approximation only. Our paper aims to argue that a reform of the welfare system needs to take into account not only public transfers but also private transfers, in particular the transfers in form of goods and services produced through unpaid household work.

Given this inability, what type of households are more vulnerable in terms of a decline in consumption when a village is hit by such shocks and what kind of microeconomic mechanism underlies the household heterogeneity in vulnerability? These questions are investigated using two-period panel data collected in rural Pakistan in 2001 and 2004. We compare consumption response to droughts, floods and health shocks and investigate how the response differs across different types of households. Empirical results show that the impact of droughts was negligible, younger and more landed households were less vulnerable to floods, and households with greater access to formal financial institutions were less vulnerable to idiosyncratic health shocks. The empirical pattern suggests the possibility of risk sharing among households that are heterogeneous in both risk aversion and credit access.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Kurosaki, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",kurosaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,"Kurosaki, Takashi/0000-0002-9762-0067","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245047, 22223003] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,23,24,0,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We demonstrate in a simple theoretical framework why before-and-after observations of practitioners overstate microfinance impacts and why estimations in some recent randomized trials understate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Our empirical study uses a unique data set from eastern Nepal to study the impact of microfinance in villages where microfinance did not previously exist.

The proposed estimators and filters are computationally attractive relative to standard likelihood-based versions since they rely on low-dimensional auxiliary statistics and so avoid computation of high-dimensional integrals. Despite their computational simplicity, we find that estimators and filters perform well in practice and lead to precise estimates of model parameters and latent variables. We show how the methods can incorporate intra-daily information to improve on the estimation and filtering. In particular, the availability of realized volatility measures help us in learning about parameters and latent states. The method is employed in the estimation of a flexible stochastic volatility model for the dynamics of the S&P 500 equity index. We find evidence of the presence of a dynamic jump rate and in favor of a structural break in parameters at the time of the recent financial crisis. We find evidence that possible measurement error in log price is small and has little effect on parameter estimates. Smoothing shows that, recently, volatility and the jump rate have returned to the low levels of 2004-2006. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both social security and capital taxation may cause labor supply to rise or fall when individuals are myopic, depending on the curvature of individuals' utility as a function of consumption. Moreover, whatever is the sign of these effects under one assumption about how myopia relates to labor supply decisions, the sign is reversed under the other assumption that is considered. Additionally, some interventions have a first-order effect on labor supply from the outset but others do not, and some labor supply effects rise with the magnitude of the intervention whereas others fall.","[Kaplow, Louis] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaplow, Louis] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kaplow, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",meskridge@law.harvard.edu,,,"John M.

In this paper, we attempt to broaden the scope of infrastructure,project evaluation by incorporating ES loss as a new criterion for decision-making. This allows a systematic consideration and thus a more efficient control of natural capital loss. We distinguish between two types of ES loss: direct ES loss induced by the ecosystem conversion and indirect ES loss associated with impacts that go beyond the width of the infrastructure because of a more widespread effect on ecological functions. To illustrate the use of this additional criterion we apply our framework in two areas of interest in a high-speed rail project in France. We focus on the provision of six regulation ES: local climate regulation, global climate regulation, air quality regulation, flood protection, water flow regulation, and biological control. We study the different proposed route options to provide an example of how choices can be improved by a spatial assessment of ES loss in terms of economic loss. We show that the ES assessment may provide a stronger argument to support these studies. The difference of ES economic loss on the infrastructure lifespan regarding the infrastructure life expectancy, between the least and the most impacting route, is about (sic)4.8 million for the first zone and about (sic)1.7 million for the second zone.","[Labarraque, Dorothee] Egis Struct & Environm, F-31130 Balma, France; [Roussel, Sebastien] UPVM, LAMETA, UMR 5474, F-34960 Montpellier, France; [Tardieu, Lea] SupAgro, LAMETA, UMR 1135, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Tardieu, L (通讯作者)，SupAgro, LAMETA, UMR 1135, 2 Pl Viala,Batiment 26, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",dorothee.labarraque@egis.fr; sebastien.roussel@lameta.univ-montp1.fr; lea.tardieu@supagro.inra.fr,"Tardieu, Lea/KAM-7305-2024","Tardieu, Lea/0000-0002-9157-5314; Roussel, Sebastien/0000-0002-6701-1754",EGIS - Structures et Environment,EGIS - Structures et Environment,"This work received financial support from EGIS - Structures et Environment.

The paper analyzes loan-making institutions that set both interest rates and minimum credit requirements. We propose analytical measures of the degree of borrower exclusion from receiving loans. We analyze five market structures: Single lender, regulated interest rate, entry, interest rate discrimination, and highly-competitive lenders.

Informed by stress amplification theory, this study considered the interaction between work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict in predicting the marital satisfaction of US workers. Using data from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce (N = 1,046 married men and 776 married women), we found work-to-family conflict's negative association with marital satisfaction was amplified when family-to-work conflict was also high.

Over half of the sampled Chinese immigrant wives in the United States reported that they became stay-at-home mothers after their immigration, and most believed that becoming a stay-at-home mother had stabilized their marriage. The traditionally defined gender role for women was actually not as much condemned by the Chinese immigrant wives as it would be if they were in China. When asked whether or not the Chinese urban wives would like to follow the male-breadwinner ideal, a common response was No way!'' Among urban Chinese couples, wives as well as husbands strongly believed that the male-breadwinner ideal would destabilize rather than stabilize their marriage. In this paper, researcher has put forth a hypothesis that the existing familial, economic, and cultural conditions in the United States and urban China play a role in shaping the Chinese couples' perceptions of the traditional family model and their decision to either adapt or reject it in association with their perceived marital stability.","[Yu, Yan] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Sociol, 2153 AuSable Hall, Allendale, MI 49401 USA",Grand Valley State University,"Yu, Y (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Sociol, 2153 AuSable Hall, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",yuy@gvsu.edu,,,,,,,35,10,11,1,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We identify the optimal level of risk-weighted assets that maximizes banks' returns in the full sample of US banks over the period 1996-2011. We find that this optimal level is cyclical for the average bank, being higher than the realized credit risk in relatively stable periods with high profit opportunities for banks but quickly decreasing below the realized in periods of turmoil. We place this cyclicality into the nexus between bank risk and monetary policy. We show that a contractionary monetary policy in stable periods, where the optimal credit risk is higher than the realized credit risk, increases the gap between them. An increase in this gap also comes as a result of an expansionary monetary policy in bad economic periods, where the realized risk is higher than the optimal risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Economic integration is modeled as trade liberalization, an easing of factor mobility restrictions and technology diffusion.

Based on these requirements, the paper aims to identify the impact of the crediting and guarantee instruments employed by entrepreneurs upon the economic-financial indicators and the cash flow. This approach is helpful in the entrepreneurs-banks relationships framework so that the best banking instruments be used in the process of entrepreneurship development within a changing business environment. To achieve the research there were identified, from those who sought advice, 43 entrepreneurs active in manufacturing due to the complexity of the crediting and guarantee instruments used in this field. Data collection and processing has resulted in the determination of cash flow and calculation of the main financial indicators for a five year time interval, indicators that are used by banks in relation to credited or secured entrepreneurs. The main results indicate that entrepreneurs who have secured business through letters of guarantee recorded positive cash flows and a better situation of the main economic and financial indicators with positive effects on their relationship with the business community.","Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Spiru Haret University,"Ilie, D (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",dragosilie2002@yahoo.com,"Ilie, Dragos George/ABB-9153-2021",,,,,,45,2,2,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,212,227,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800014,0

Consequently, we know little about the applicability of various capital structure theories to firms that are private, small, and/or outside the manufacturing industry in these economies. In this paper, we conduct a comparative test of the trade-off and pecking order theories using a comprehensive firm-level dataset that covers manufacturing, non-manufacturing, small, large, publicly-traded, and private firms in a major developing economy, Turkey. The trade-off theory provides a better description of the capital structures of all firm types than the pecking order theory. Moreover, the trade-off theory appears to be particularly suitable for understanding the financing choices of large private firms in the non-manufacturing sector and when the economic environment is relatively stable. By contrast, pecking order theory is most useful when it comes to small publicly-traded manufacturing firms, especially when the economic environment is relatively unstable.","[Koksal, Bulent] Ipek Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey; [Orman, Cuneyt] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Ipek University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Orman, C (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istiklal Cad,10 Ulus, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",cuneyt.orman@tcmb.gov.tr,"Koksal, Bulent/C-5928-2012","Koksal, Bulent/0000-0001-9853-7006",,,,,64,44,57,0,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

It is given some results of macroeconomic analysis for retroperiod and medium-term forecast period, in particular it is evaluated the effect of the imposition of trade sanctions between Russia and some of its trading partners.

This conclusion is straightforward within their framework in which asset price inflation shows up as a factor augmenting the IS curve. In this chapter, we pursue a different modeling strategy so that, in the end, asset price dynamics will be incorporated into the NK Phillips curve. We put ourselves, therefore, in the best position to obtain a significant stabilizing role for asset price targeting.

As an organization and a community institution the Norwegian Armed Forces is responsible for governing large financial, material and human resources. Purpose of Study: To discuss efficiency promoting and efficiency restraining factors in the Norwegian Armed Forces. Sources of Evidence: We have chosen to discuss various efficiency promoting and restraining factors related to four parts of the Norwegian Armed Forces tasks, structure and resource assets. These four parts are the new model of governance, the budgeting and accounting process, the procurement policies, and the salary and career policy. Main Argument: By rationalizing these four parts the Norwegian Armed Forces follow the developments that are taking place within other public sectors in Norway. With the introduction of the model of governance an important step is taken in the direction of adaption to the market, although this market may be seen as a quasi-market. Conclusions: The model of governance is efficiency promoting, but has a long way to go before it functions optimally. More efficiency promoting measures have been implemented in terms of the budget and accounting process. This has led to an increased insight into the ongoing processes and an increased degree of control. The implementation of a new procurement system is the most efficiency promoting factor in order to improve all aspects of the Norwegian Armed Forces procurements. However, the salary and career policy is perceived as too complicated and poorly communicated. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The paper computes a measure of financial integration based on network statistics of banks participating in the global market of inter-bank syndicated loans. The network statistics used are indegree, outdegree, betweenness, clustering coefficients, authority, and hub centrality. The paper fits a count data model in the cross-section for the period 1980-2007, and finds that the level of financial integration of the average bank in a country is a robust determinant of the incidence of banking crises. While borrowing (weighted indegree) is positively associated with a higher incidence of crises, betweenness is associated with a lower incidence. That is, the more important is the average bank of a country to the global bank network, as captured by betweenness, the smaller the number of crises the country experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

China currently controls completely the mining activity, the enrichment technologies and metallurgy, and end-metal products of rare earths, resulting for both Europe and the U.S.A. in full industrial dependency. Due to high demand and limited availability of rare earth elements (REEs), Europe is unable to meet its industrial needs today for the manufacturing sector. Therefore the EU has included them in the group of 14 critical minerals. The balance of demand and supply in the world market of Rare Earth Metals was always rather unstable. The most significant increase of prices took place during the years 2009-2011, followed by a sudden and substantial fall in prices due mainly to the actual, persistent heavy economic crisis of the industrialized countries.

The research methodology consists of displaying some characteristics of the central banks engaged in the process of European monetary integration, taking into account aspects concerning both the attributes of their governance, and their position related to the financial stability objective, an increasingly important parameter to consider after the global financial crisis outbreak (GFC2007). A foothold for the paper is the economic literature which has been formulated some specific criteria for evaluating the elements considered.

We provide a different and novel solution approach to dynamic debt than in the extant literature. For many dynamic debt covenants, ex-ante credit spread term structures can be derived in closed-form using modified barrier option mathematics, whereby debt spreads can be expressed using combinations of single barrier options (both knock-in and knock-out), double barrier options, double-touch barrier options, in-out barrier options, and one-touch double barrier binary options. We observe that debt principal swap down covenants decrease the magnitude of credit spreads but increase the slope of the credit curve, transforming downward sloping curves into upward sloping ones. On the other hand, ratchet covenants increase the magnitude of ex-ante spreads without dramatically altering the slope of the credit curve. These covenants may be optimized by appropriately setting restructuring boundaries, which entails a trade-off between the reduction in spreads against restructuring costs. Overall, explicitly modeling this latent option to alter debt leads to term structures of credit spreads that are more consistent with observed empirics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Another problem is that profits are usually analyzed on an annual basis, whereas CSR is of a long-time nature.

There were no strong correlation found among efficiency scores and chosen exogenous factors, however, there has been discovered interesting thing about the smallest municipalities, which in this combination of services, show almost the same efficiency, like the biggest size category in the sample ( from 20 to 50 thousands of inhabitants), which might contribute to the discussion about amalgamation.","[Fercikova, Veronika] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Fercíková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Publ Adm & Reg Dev, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",veronika.fercikova@euba.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,174,184,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500020,0

Thus, there are identified several determinants of NPLs, both internal, such bank size, capital adequacy, cost efficiency and bank risk taking behaviour, but also external, such GDP growth, inflation and unemployment and there is considered also the impact of the financial and economic crisis. The analysis is developed by processing the data of 13 Western European countries for the period 2000-2011, using econometric methods. Empirical results showed expected significant positive linkages of NPLs ratio with determinants like bank size, cost efficiency, unemployment and crisis, but also significant negative linkages NPLs ratio with GDP growth and capital adequacy. Deepening the analysis by building an testing a regression model for NPLs ratio determination it resulted that the main determinants of NPLs ratio rising are unemployment, crisis, bank size and cost efficiency management, while the GDP growth, capital adequacy and bank credit to private sector as percentage to GDP are acting against the formation of NPLs. The results leaded to the conclusion that banks need to improve their cost efficiency management and invest in departments for following and recovering the granted loans. Also, the governments should focus on encouraging employment as base for improving the borrowers' repayment capacity and of generating GDP growth.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Filip, BF (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",bogdan.filip@feaa.uaic.ro,"Filip, Bogdan Florin/AAG-6091-2021",,,,,,11,2,2,0,19,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,146,155,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600012,0

We show that the FRM market share is sharply lower when mortgages are difficult to securitize, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in access to liquid securitization markets generated by a regulatory cutoff and time variation in private securitization activity. We interpret our findings as evidence that lenders are reluctant to retain the prepayment and interest rate risk embedded in FRMs. The form of securitization (private versus government backed) has little effect on FRM supply during periods in which private securitization markets are well functioning.","[Fuster, Andreas; Vickery, James] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Vickery, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",james.vickery@ny.frb.org,,"Fuster, Andreas/0000-0002-4256-5005",,,,,50,35,41,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Another group consists of hospitals of a business-corporation type with different legal forms that are considered as business companies. Here the founder is the city, a business entity or a natural person. Generally hospitals are understood as non-profit entities, whose inputs and outputs are based on a linear system. The inputs and outputs used in this paper are obtained from the annual reports of hospitals for the year 2013. Data are applied to models of financial distress and results are compared.

Biological and genetic predispositions. Healthcare system. Lifestyle including diet. Influence of the environment Consumers themselves can affect their lifestyle and particularly their dietary choices in the decision-making process when buying food. In terms of the content of the presented article, the determinants concerning the diet, particularly compliance to the diet while suffering from diabetes mellitus and being on a gluten-free diet, are very significant. They can lead to improvements in the quality of life, as well as to a better position in a working team and in social life. Therefore, the aim of this article is to answer the question: Is there a sufficient offer and availability of food on the market in the Czech Republic for selected groups of consumers with certain health limitations to meet their specific needs? This issue is addressed on the basis of a questionnaire survey in selected operational units in retail and hospitality. The results are analyzed, evaluated and compared in terms of availability, supply and prices. Compliance to the diet represents the purchase of suitable food whose availability in the market is very uneven and in some operational units of retail or hospitality industries this assortment is not available or is attributed to bio products and healthy diet supplements. The current state of the offer including the prices of the investigated assortment is not sufficient.

Firms with strong bank relationships exhibit significantly decreased likelihood of filing for reorganization and increased length of time needed for making the decision. The findings suggest that in a bank-oriented financial system where banks are the dominant providers of capital, bank relationships better enhance informational advantages for banks and reduce coordination problems among banks, which limits firm filings for costly reorganizations.

In this study a literature review methodology is used for classifying the capitalist and the entrepreneur form different profiles and in relation with the innovation process. Data are obtained mainly from books and articles, relying on an interdisciplinary perspective. Research findings show that the figure of the capitalist is distinguished from that of the entrepreneur in front of business activities. Thus, the capitalist is financially committed by offering the capital, expecting as a return the financial interest rate, and assuming a financial risk. Instead, the entrepreneur is committed with innovation and change, expecting the profit as remuneration for the assumed organizational risk. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Stochastic analysis confirms the overall positive effects of reform that is in general considered as successful. It is shown that economy is more sensitive to the shocks on labor than on capital income taxes. Results are in line with expectations and theory and we can see that consumption and investments react in opposite way. Simulated impulse response function is found in data after the tax reform and therefore the DSGE model is confirmed as suitable tool for fiscal policy.","[Konopkova, Zlatica] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Konôpková, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",zlatica.konopkova@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN ASSOC COMENIUS-EACO,BRNO,"PEKARSKA 18, BRNO, 602 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-905405-1-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,51,60,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000461004000006,0

The passive approach is characterised by a low participatory degree of communication between public administration authorities and the public. The communication takes place because public administration is legally obliged to do so. Within the pragmatic approach there comes to a proactive communication. It takes place at an impulse of public administration, mostly ad hoc (selectively) and usually ex post. The highest communication type is the participatory approach.

On the investor side, P2P disintermediates an asset class of consumer loans, and investors may be able to capture rents associated with the removal of a layer of financial intermediation. Risk and portfolio choice questions linger prior to any inference. On the borrower side, evidence suggests that proximate knowledge (direct or inferred) unearths soft information. Thus, P2P may be able to offer pricing and/or access benefits to potential borrowers. Early research suggests that the future of consumer lending will involve more big data and reintermediation of underwriting by all types of financial institutions.

The research results have revealed influence of the different organizational climate factors on work style as a composite variable and its subfactors. Although no overall effects could be established, organizational climate factors such as positive motivation, positive interpersonal relationships, efficient management and organizational support have proven to inflict positive influence on specific work style factors. The original approach of the concepts and the relationships between them, the use of SM II, a questionnaire crated for work styles research and the multiple application and further research applications represent solid arguments for the value of the study.

In this work we begin by analyzing user authentication methods being used currently in Internet banking, in order to propose a multi layered authentication technique which integrates to suit different Internet banking services based on risk assessment criteria's and other constraints. Multi-layered authentication in the Internet banking context refers to the requirement of multiple login names, passwords, and biometrics factors. Many systems utilize a combination of these methods in order to increase the level of security. Thus, a possible option is to introduce biometric authentication.","[Normalini, M.

The economic based principal-agent theorization is however falling short of allowing researchers to evaluate the quality of such relationships. In this paper, we depart from the mainstream principal-agent theoretical argumentation by attending to Leader-Member Exchange theory (LMX theory), a commonly applied theorization in organizational psychology and communication management literature repertoire. We delineate relevant governance relationships among various governance agents across contexts and subsequently, theoretically argue the applicability of LMX theory in explaining their dyadic relationships. Interfacing LMX theory with corporate governance, we further provide the necessary instruments for measuring governance agents' relationships quality. Despite the theoretical and argumentative nature of our research endeavour, this paper presents a novel attempt to theoretically demonstrate in light of the subtlety in governance scholarship with respect to the quality of corporate relationships prevailing in any established governance arrangements, that the LMX theory provides an applicable and useful framework through which the dynamics of corporate relationships within the context of corporate governance could be appropriately analyzed and evaluated.

The aim of such systems is to differentiate premiums for clients with high and low claims ratios to limit the phenomenon of the negative selection of customers and to attract low-claims ratio customers. Thus, bonus-malus systems also fulfil a marketing function and are a tool for gaining competitive advantage. In typical bonus-malus systems, the tariff class to which the client is classified is determined on the basis of the class to which the client was assigned in the previous year and the number of claims made in the last year. In the insurance market in recent years there has been a tendency to modify bonus-malus systems so that the history of losses over the past two or even three years is taken into account. In addition, premiums are differentiated depending on how long the insured has been a client of the insurer. This paper is devoted to the analysis of typical systems and modern modified systems according to the structures available in the Polish market, calculating measures of the effectiveness of the tariff systems.","[Poprawska, Ewa] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Insurance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Poprawska, E (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Insurance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",ewa.poprawska@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,472,480,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200063,0

Aiming to address these challenges, the accounting profession looked at Information Technology ( IT), which evolves and advances with an ever increasing pace, as a crucial facilitator. Today, modern IT systems enable accountants to have real time access to more and new types of information. New technologies with extraordinary analytical capacity, created a situation where voluminous data can be collected, processed and presented in ways and at times that could not even be imagined in the past. These developments necessitated the extension of the accountants' role, regarding IT systems, from plain users to managers, designers and evaluators. Consequently, IT became one of the core required skills of modern accounting and finance professionals. This had to be mapped onto the accounting and finance higher education curricula, whose IT content has been constantly under a close inspection and revision by educators, professionals and national and international accounting bodies, over the past years. However, despite the fact that several attempts have been reported to develop a standard, the current situation shows that there are plenty of diverse approaches to incorporate IT into accounting and finance curricula and that we are far from reaching a widely accepted consensus. The present study presents a charting of the IT content of accounting and finance curricula offered in Greek higher education institutes, as part of a research project aiming to investigate the compliance of Greek curricula with the emerging trends in Accounting & Finance Education. Information about the curricula was drawn from the websites of all the accounting and/or finance departments of Greek higher education institutes.

The basic starting point for collective investment is to minimize the risk of investors, through the diversification of the portfolio. The benefits of collective investment is more efficient diversification of risk, professional management of savings, availability and expansion of investment opportunities for small investors. There are also large selection of funds, high liquidity, lower transaction costs, and insufficient information and tax advantages compared to bank deposits. And these are what is attracted for more and more investors to invest their funds right this way. In the case of investment funds, however, is to get the cash in form of subscription of shares, which investors buy, thereby increasing the risk that investors will run regardless of the amount of the income. Along with the theme of collective investment came also to the fore the portfolio theory and its application of this theory as well as in the field of collective investment.

In this paper, we choose the reinsurance rate of small or mid-sized property insurance companies from 2009 to 2013, and on the help of Dupont analysis, we try to find the impact of reinsurance on operating performance. In order to find out the different influence on operating performance, we have applied cluster analysis and classified those companies.

Sawmills have tried for decades to start producing timber buildings in order to capitalise on their core product; sawn timber. Their efforts have often failed, which is attributed to the different business logics between sawing timber and constructing buildings. This research identifies the supply chain structure as an important classification of production and business logic. Many firms operate make-to-stock, make-to-order and even engineer-to-order within the same firm, thus utilising the same or overlapping resources. From a theoretical viewpoint, this paper explores the problem of multiplicity in supply chains within construction and construction supplier firms. Literature on operations strategies, operations management, and supply chain structures is covered and put into perspective. It is an important capability to handle diversity in supply chain structures, not only when expanding business, but also in balancing different product categories internally e.g. to handle variations in market demand. The effect on internal resource utilisation can be vast. Operations management must take the differences in supply chain structures into account when developing key performance indicators and operations management strategies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

One of the most crucial phases of the life-cycle of a business is the moment of transferring its ownership and leadership. The lack of succession planning is one of the most important reasons why many first-generation firms do not survive their founders. Preparing for a business transfer is a long and complex process entailing a number of difficulties. In a number of European countries appropriate structures has been created for a successful transfer of family businesses to the next generation. Examples of these structures are: passing the baton in Finland, from a single project to a path of overall support in Netherlands, Kit. brunello in Italy and the FAMBUS diagnosis and self-therapy model in Greece. The findings of the FAMBUS (Family Businesses) research project, are based on the results of a quantitative study of family businesses in Greece and Finland, carried out in 2014. As regards the issue of succession, the findings indicate that: (a) most of the owners-founders are intended to pass the family business to their children (b) less than half of the owners have already chosen their successor (c) a relatively high percentage of the owners intend to continue working in the family business even after their retirement and (d) the three most important criteria that the owners have used for choosing their successor/s in the family business, are: personal skills, loyalty in business and coincidence with the vision of the company.

The analysis is based on cross sectional regressions. The capital structure indicators refer to long-term debt, short-term debt; total debt and total equity, while return on assets and return on equity are the performance proxies. Previous studies indicate asset tangibility, tax, risk, liquidity and inflation as capital structure determinants in Romanian manufacturing companies. As long as these factors have an important impact on financing decisions, they will he included in the analysis as they are expected to also influence performance. Results indicate that performance in Romanian companies is higher when they avoid debt and operate based on equity. However, it seems that manufacturing companies do not have sufficient internal funding to undertake profitable investments and do not use their assets effectively. During times of increased taxes and inflation profitable companies divest part of their assets reducing their costs. There is an indication of risk-taking behavior across manufacturing companies. This show a preference for debt when they are in financial difficulties and they face high business risks, or when they cannot settle their debts due to a lack of cash. Due to missing data regarding long-term debt ratios, those regression results are not statistically significant. Moreover, the regression models referring to return on equity explain a reduced proportion of its variation.

The For the last two decades, the system of training of translators and of intercultural communication experts in Russia has been influenced by global integration processes and internal market requirements. We considered some existing academic goals, strategies, programmes, curriculum and state standards in the field of intercultural and public communication experts. In particular we examined the didactic training model aimed at development of professional translation and intercultural communication skills, choosing translation strategies and technologies, accumulation of experience in the translation of different types of texts in various potential professional communicative situations leading to the formation of translation competence. The innovation of this approach resulted from the need to separate the two specialties - that of translator and that of the specialist in cross-cultural communication, because the specifics of professional activities of the last-named in highest degree includes intercessory and meditative functions. Professional responsibilities of experts in intercultural communication are not limited to the translation component, but include also cross-cultural interaction, advocacy, resolution of disputes and conflicts in government and public administration bodies. Since in the work plan of this new course there are only theoretical courses on intercultural communication, as well as some practical disciplines of business communication, it was extremely important in the course of the translation to form meditative intercultural skills taking into consideration the professional sphere of public administration. We propose a model of formation of translation competences in parallel with the cross-cultural qualifications.","[Vladimirovna, Stepanova Ekaterina] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Volgograd Branch, St Gagarina 8, Volgograd 400134, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Vladimirovna, SE (通讯作者)，Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Volgograd Branch, St Gagarina 8, Volgograd 400134, Russia.",stepanova.volg@mail.ru,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,831,838,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500099,0

Most of the marginalized Roma face low education level, long-term unemployment and very low incomes (they are mostly dependent on the social benefits). In this paper we focus on time preference rates of the marginalised poor Roma. The measurement of time discounting and present-biased preferences is based on standard methodology where the respondents are asked to choose between receiving smaller amounts earlier at the time of interviewing or larger amounts with three months delay. The same choices are asked at a future time frame (smaller amounts in six months and larger amounts in nine months). In order to control for potential confounds due to lower credibility the front end delay method is introduced. According to the results there are almost 48 percent of people with time-inconsistent preferences (27 % have present-biased and 21 % future-biased preferences). Men and people with higher level of education are more likely to have consistent preferences than women and people with lower level of education.","[Zelinsky, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Zelinsky, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, SK-04001 Kosice, Slovakia",Charles University Prague; Technical University Kosice,"Zelinsky, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.zelinsky@ies-prague.org,"Zelinsky, Tomas/D-1539-2010","Zelinsky, Tomas/0000-0001-7198-0278",,,,,58,1,1,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Recently, the phenomenon of logistics sprawl, i.e. the relocation of logistics facilities away from inner urban areas to suburban areas has received an increasing level of attention from both academics and policy makers. In this paper, a literature review of the various impacts of logistics sprawl is provided with a detailed taxonomy of the impacts. It has been observed that logistics sprawl contributed changes in geography of urban freight, increasing trucks' travelled distance and consequent emissions and impacting the commuting of logistics employment. The paper presents a summary of the empirical findings illustrating the additional distance trucks travel due to logistics sprawl in several European and North American cities. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of the measures and policies implemented in various metropolitan areas to reintegrate small-scale logistics facilities within inner urban areas to act as consolidation centres.

The empirical findings are consistent with the macro-finance literature suggesting that q-theory models with nonconvex investment frictions better explain the data.

But to what extent is behavior in this ganie sensitive to the way the instructions are framed? We use the Berg et al. trust game played for ten rounds with random re-matching to study this. We implement a number of variations in the way the game is presented to subjects. We show that levels of trust, reciprocity and returns to trust, are significantly higher under goal framing, which highlights the conflict inherent in the game, between self-interest and maximizing social surplus. Furthermore, with such framing, trust measured via the experimental game exhibits significant positive correlation with trust measured via the Social Values Orientation questionnaire.

However, in the Euro crisis, that of the Sterling pound became equally low, while the other European currencies such as the Danish kroner increased its their interest rate. By using secured rates, the following analysis examines why the Sterling pound and the Danish kroner showed asymmetric features in deviations from the covered interest parity (CIP) condition. The regression results suggest that there was a structural break in the determinants of the deviations across the European currencies in the two crises. Currency-specific money market risk was critical in explaining the deviations in the global financial crisis (GFC), while EU bank credit risk and global market risk were useful in explaining the deviations in the Euro crisis. In particular, EU bank credit risk and global market risk had asymmetric effect on the deviations. The asymmetry explains contrasted features between the Sterling pound and the Danish kroner.

Yet, in reality, the rents from exploiting national resources are often concentrated in the hands of a few. If resource rents were to be taxed, on the other hand, substantial amounts of public money could be raised and used to cover the population's infrastructure needs, such as access to electricity, water, sanitation, communication technology and roads, which all play important roles in a nation's economic development process. Here, the authors examine to what extent existing resource rents could be used to provide universal access to these infrastructures.","[Fuss, Sabine; Chen, Claudine] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Jakob, Michael] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Potsdam Inst Climate Change Impact Res, Berlin, Germany; [Marxen, Annika] Tech Univ Berlin, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Rao, Narasimha D.] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Potsdam Inst Climate Change Impact Res, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Fuss, S (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",fuss@mcc-berlin.net,"Rao, Narasimha D/K-5357-2012; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Rao, Narasimha D/0000-0003-1888-5292; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,49,12,13,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Internal conflict negatively affects domestic bank credit to the private sector, and the extent of this impact depends on the degree of ethnic fractionalization.

We find that, after managers are insulated by the adoption of an antitakeover law, they take value-destroying actions that reduce their firms' stock volatility and risk of distress. To illustrate one such action, we show that managers undertake diversifying acquisitions that target firms likely to reduce risk, have negative announcement returns, and are concentrated among firms with managers who gain the most from reducing risk. Our findings suggest that instruments typically used to motivate managers, such as greater financial leverage and larger ownership stakes, exacerbate risk-related agency challenges.

This paper examines the roles and characteristics of U.S. community banks in the past decade, covering the recent economic boom and downturn. We analyze risk characteristics of acquired community banks, compare pre- and post-acquisition performance, and investigate how the acquisitions have affected SBL. Contrary to the concerns, our analysis shows that the overall amount of SBL increases more after a merger when a community bank is acquired by a large bank. Data also suggest an overall (regardless of mergers) declining SBL trend for all bank size groups. In fact, the decline in the SBL ratio, on average, has been more severe among community banks, relative to large banks. Our results indicate that mergers involving community bank targets over the past decade have enhanced the overall safety and soundness of the banking system without adversely impacting SBL.

We examine the role of corporate governance in the accounting discretion inherent in goodwill impairment decisions under the IFRS. More specifically, we investigate whether, in Australia, stronger governance strengthens associations between economic factors and goodwill impairment loss but weakens associations between contracting incentives and goodwill impairment loss. Using data from 2007 to 2012, we find evidence consistent with the notion that stronger governance enhances the associations between economic factors and goodwill impairment loss. However, we find that strong governance cannot completely eliminate the opportunistic use of discretion in an impairment decision, especially when pre-impairment income is negative, and when the impairment occurs in the first year of a CEO's tenure. Our results are robust with regard to alternative measures of the dependent variable, firm performance variables, and the governance variable, even after controlling for potential self-selection biases.

This article analyses the performance of Bank Indonesia (the central bank) and Indonesia's Ministry of Finance in forecasting real GDP growth and consumer inflation over the last decade or so. It compares the quality of their forecasts with those of international institutions, aligning the timing of these forecasts to maximise comparability. Overall, the Indonesian authoritiesespecially the Ministry of Finance, in its revised central government budget (APBN-P)perform respectably against their international comparators and there is no statistically significant bias in any of the forecasts. Still, there are mild indications of an optimistic bias in forecasts of inflation and growth, and all institutions tend to miss growth slowdowns. The results raise doubts about the value of fiscal policy for near-term macro stabilisation in Indonesia. Likewise, a wide range of uncertainty in forecasting inflation complicates the use of monetary policy for inflation targeting, at least one year ahead. Sebuah prasyarat bagi berhasilnya kebijakan ekonomi makro dari otoritas kuangan adalah kapasitas yang memadai untuk memprediksi kondisi ekonomi dengan akurasi yang baik.

Ia membandingkan kualitas prediksi kedua institusi tersebut dengan prediksi institusi-institusi asing, setelah mencocokkan periode prediksi-prediksi tersebut demi memaksimumkan akurasi perbandingan. Secara umum, otoritas di Indonesia - terutama Kementerian Keuangan dalam Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara Perubahan (APBN-P) memiliki kinerja yang baik jika dibandingkan dengan institusi-institusi asing dan tidak ditemukan bias yang signifikan dalam prediksinya. Meski demikian, terdapat sedikit indikasi bias optimistik dalam prediksi mereka akan inflasi dan pertumbuhan ekonom. Di lain pihak, perlambatan pertumbuhan ekonomi cenderung luput dari prediksi kedua institusi tersebut. Hasil ini menimbulkan keraguan akan nilai kebijakan fiskal bagi stabilisasi makro jangka pendek di Indonesia. Selain itu, sejumlah besar ketidakpastian dalam memprediksi inflasi menambah kompleksitas penggunaan kebijakan moneter bagi inflation targeting' paling tidak selama satu tahun setelahnya.",,,,,,,,,,,24,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Most cash flow variation at a point in time is diversifiable either idiosyncratic to a given fund or explained by the fund's age. Both capital calls and distributions also have a procyclical systematic component. Distributions are more sensitive than calls, implying procyclical aggregate net cash flows. A consequence is that the well-known finding that funds raised in hot markets underperform in absolute terms is sharply attenuated when comparing to public equities. Consistent with a liquidity premium for calling capital in bad times, we find that funds with a relatively high propensity to do so perform better in both absolute and relative terms.

Many of these studies have found new and useful ways to investigate travel to work not only across time and space, but also across different subsets of commuters. This paper examines 26 metro regions in the U.S. that were previously measured in 2002 to see how commuting travel has changed between 1990 and 2003 and from 2003 to 2013. In this manuscript the excess commuting framework, disaggregated across a number of categories of commuters, is applied using data readily available from the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. These disaggregations illuminate interesting trends in the jobs-housing balance and resulting commuting patterns of different kinds of workers across U.S. metro regions. Results show that commutes are generally increasing although Columbus, OH is the notable exception. Additionally, some of the commuting measures are better suited for longitudinal analyses of a single metro region and others more suited to comparisons across metro regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are no clear empirical results regarding the ex post effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on firm performance, partially due to the inadequacy of available firm-level data. We build a brand new firm-level dataset able both to represent the extent of Italian firms' foreign activity and to provide reliable measures of key performance indicators, especially total factor productivity (TFP) and employment. We then use a propensity score matching procedure to analyze the causal relationship between FDI and firm performance. Firms investing abroad for the very first time, especially in advanced economies, show higher productivity and employment dynamics in the years following the investment: the average positive effect on TFP is driven by new multinationals operating in specialized and high-tech sectors, while the positive employment gains are explained by an increase of the white collar component. On average there are no negative effects on the parent firm's blue collar component.","[Borin, Alessandro; Mancini, Michele] Bank Italy, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Nazl 91, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Mancini, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Nazl 91, Rome, Italy.",michele.mancini@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,76,37,39,4,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We find that MD&A accruals explain a statistically and economically significant portion of firm-level accruals and identify more persistent accruals. We find that the explanatory power of MDEM accruals is higher for more readable 10-Ks, thereby providing evidence for the construct validity of the readability measures. To highlight the flexibility of the SVR method, we apply it to other dependent variables and disclosures. We find that MD&A-based cash-flow forecasts produced by SVR predict next period's cash flows. We apply SVR to conference call transcripts and find accruals estimates have similar explanatory power to MD&A accruals. Finally, the explanatory power of MD&A accruals increases between 1994 and 2013. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The challenges for the resource sector will vary across commodities. Competition in the new market for low-carbon goods and services will be tough; sustained competitive advantage will be difficult to maintain due to capital mobility. With these challenges in mind, this article proposes three questions for Canadians looking ahead to a low-carbon future. First, how large will the market for low-carbon goods and services be? Second, where are Canada's advantages likely to lie in serving these markets? Finally, what are the roles for Canada's existing natural resource industries in a low-carbon economy, and what are the strategies to maximize the value of these resources?","[Leach, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Leach, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,"Leach, Andrew/0000-0003-1823-3876",,,,,13,2,2,1,12,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

It exploits a unique longitudinal firm-level database that covers all manufacturing firms in Turkey over the 1992-2001 period. Turkey is taken as an example of a developing economy that, in that period, had been technologically advancing and becoming increasingly integrated with the world market. The empirical analysis is performed at firm level within a dynamic framework using a model that depicts the employment and wage trends for skilled and unskilled workers separately. In particular, the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM-SYS) procedure is applied to a panel dataset of about 15,000 firms. Our results confirm the theoretical expectation that developing countries face the phenomena of skill-biased technological change and skill-enhancing trade, both leading to increasing the employment and wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers. In particular, a strong evidence of a relative skill bias emerges: both domestic and imported technologies increase the relative demand for skilled workers more than the demand for the unskilled. Learning by exporting also appears to have a relative skill- biased impact, while FDI imply an absolute skill bias.","[Meschi, Elena] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Taymaz, Erol] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Vivarelli, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Vivarelli, Marco] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Middle East Technical University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Vivarelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Vivarelli, M (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",marco.vivarelli@unicatt.it,"Vivarelli, Marco/AFM-1199-2022; Taymaz, Erol/B-1269-2008","Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0001-8982-2163; Taymaz, Erol/0000-0001-7525-6674; VIVARELLI, MARCO/0000-0003-0500-9461; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8746-9324; Meschi, Elena/0000-0002-0314-9965",,,,,89,28,30,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The extra foreclosure lag tends to be longer in judicial foreclosure states than in states with a redemption policy.

Specifically, our results show that the combined effect of individual stock crowded trades and individual stock investor sentiment on excess returns is positive and significant, which reveals the importance of anomaly factors in asset pricing. Furthermore, our results suggest that increasing individual stock buyer-initiated crowded trades will increase excess returns simultaneously; however, increasing individual stock seller-initiated crowded trades will decrease excess returns simultaneously.

Using panel data over a period of 42 years (1973-2014), we apply Pedroni/Johansen cointegration test methods, followed by Granger long-run and Wald short-run causality tests. To allow for spatial heterogeneity we then apply Time Series Cross Section (TSCS) Granger causality tests for each of the eight analysed countries separately. Our results confirm a long-run uni-directional Granger causality which runs from GDP to air passenger traffic and also to air freight volumes. Contrary to the existing literature we do not find a long-run bi-directional causality which confirms that spatial dimensions and context matter (i.e. low income and large populations). The absence of short-run causality and the identified time lags of 3-4 years should guide aviation firms and policy makers in the preparation of necessary infrastructure required to support the strong air transport growth potential.

Via the fraction of newly issued short-term bonds, equity holders control the maturity structure, which affects their endogenous default decision. A shortening equilibrium with accelerated default emerges when cash flows deteriorate over time so that debt recovery is higher if default occurs earlier. Self-enforcing shortening and lengthening equilibria may coexist, with the latter possibly Pareto dominating the former.

We find that medical expenses more than double between ages 70 and 90 and that they are very concentrated: the top 10 per cent of all spenders are responsible for 52 per cent of medical spending in a given year. In addition, those currently experiencing either very low or very high medical expenses are likely to find themselves in the same position in the future. We also find that the poor consume more medical goods and services than the rich and have a much larger share of their expenses covered by the government. Overall, the government pays for over 65 per cent of the elderly's medical expenses. Despite this, the expenses that remain after government transfers are even more concentrated among a small group of people. Thus, government health insurance, while potentially very valuable, is far from complete. Finally, while medical expenses before death can be large, on average they constitute only a small fraction of total spending, both in the aggregate and over the life cycle. Hence, medical expenses before death do not appear to be an important driver of the high and increasing medical spending found in the US.","[De Nardi, Mariacristina; French, Eric; McCauley, Jeremy] UCL, London, England; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [De Nardi, Mariacristina; French, Eric] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [French, Eric] CEPR, London, England; [Jones, John Bailey] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA",University of London; University College London; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"De Nardi, M (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;De Nardi, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.;De Nardi, M (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;De Nardi, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",denardim@nber.org; eric.french.econ@gmail.com; jbjones@albany.edu; jeremymccauley@gmail.com,,"McCauley, Jeremy/0000-0002-8402-483X; French, Eric/0000-0002-1029-3738","European Research Council (ERC) [614328]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Macroeconomics; Michigan Research Retirement Center; ESRC; Economic and Social Research Council [1162625, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [614328] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Macroeconomics(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Michigan Research Retirement Center; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The authors thank Elaine Kelly, Jon Skinner and participants at the 'Medical Spending across the Developed World' workshop at the Institute for Fiscal Studies for helpful comments, and Debra Reed-Gillette, Joshua Volosov and the staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for detailed explanations of the data.

Insights from Big Data,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,APPAM Fall Research Conference,"NOV, 2015","Miami, FL",APPAM,,,ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; OPPORTUNITY; PROGRAM; IMPACT,"Housing choice vouchers provide low-income households with additional income to spend on rental housing in the private market. The assistance vouchers provide is substantial, offering the potential to dramatically expand the neighborhoodsand associated public schoolsthat low-income households can reach. However, existing research on the program suggests that housing choice voucher holders live in neighborhoods with schools that are no better than those accessible to other households with similar incomes. Households, in other words, do not seem to spend the additional income provided by the voucher to access better schools. In this analysis we rely on a large-scale administrative data set to explore why voucher households typically do not live near to better schools, as measured by school-level proficiency rates. We combine confidential administrative data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on 1.4 million housing choice voucher holders in 15 states, with school-level data from 5,841 different school districts, to examine why the average housing voucher holder does not live near to higher-performing schools than otherwise similar households without vouchers. Specifically, we use the large-scale administrative data set to test whether voucher holders living in areas with good schools nearby and slack housing markets move toward better schools when schools become salient for themthat is, when their oldest child becomes school eligible. We take advantage of the thick sample of households with young children provided through our administrative data to implement both a household fixed effects and a regression discontinuity design. Together these analyses shed light on whether voucher households are more likely to move toward better schools when schools are most relevant, and how market conditions shape that response. We find that families with vouchers are more likely to move toward a better school in the year before their oldest child meets the eligibility cutoff for kindergarten, suggesting salience matters. Further, the magnitude of the effect is larger in metropolitan areas with a relatively high share of affordable rental units located near high-performing schools and in neighborhoods in close proximity to higher-performing schools. Results suggest that, if given the appropriate information and opportunities, more voucher families would move to better schools when their children reach school age.

Unlike standard moment-based tests, the score-based test statistic includes information on the level of correlation under the null hypothesis and local power arguments indicate the benefits of doing so.

Some important results emerge. First, greater international trade, on average, promotes economic growth and amplifies growth volatility in the long run, and hence induces a positive long-run association between growth and growth volatility. Second, greater international trade stimulates economic activities and mitigates economic fluctuations, on average, in the short run, and therefore causes a negative short run correlation between growth and growth volatility. And third, there is large heterogeneity in the effects of trade, depending upon a country's development level, financial system, macroeconomic policies, human capital, corruption, and labor regulation.

Estimates from a probit model suggest that cognitive and non-cognitive skills are important drivers and explain part of the difference between natives and immigrants. These findings are supported by results from a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis. Our paper delivers first evidence that differences in non-cognitive and cognitive skills contribute to the explanation of the financial market participation gap between natives and immigrants.

The article provides a time series characterization of the volatility components arising when the volatility process is fractionally integrated, through a generalization of the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, and proposes a new integrated moving average (MA) model, formulated in terms of the fractional lag operator, the FLagIMA model, which allows the series to be decomposed as the sum of a fractional noise and a white noise component. We provide an assessment of the predictive performance of the FLagIMA model in comparison with other popular predictors and two other rival specifications, the fractionally integrated first-order MA model, and a fractional equal root integrated MA model. For statistical inference we show that, under mild regularity conditions, the Whittle pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator of the model parameters is consistent and asymptotically normal, also in the nonstationary case.","[Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Proietti, Tommaso] Aahrus Univ, CREATES, Aahrus, Denmark",University of Rome Tor Vergata; CREATES,"Proietti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.;Proietti, T (通讯作者)，Aahrus Univ, CREATES, Aahrus, Denmark.",tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN [prot. 2010J3LZEN]; Danish National Research Foundation","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","The author wishes to thank the Editor, an Associate Editor, and two Referees, for their helpful comments and suggestions that led to several improvements in this article, Federico Carlini for discussion on the fractional lag operator and Niels Haldrup for discussion concerning Whittle estimation of the fractionally integrated models.

In a world with corruption, firms must bribe corrupt officials to enter the market. For a given level of bribes, higher tax rates and stricter enforcement of taxation decrease tax evasion but typically reduce market entry. However, when the level of bribes reacts to tax policy, higher taxes and stricter enforcement of taxation can have a double benefit. Up to a certain threshold, for which we develop a simple rule, stricter enforcement increases market entry and reduces tax evasion.","[Seidel, Andre; Thum, Marcel] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Thum, Marcel] Ifo Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Thum, Marcel] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Ifo Institut,"Seidel, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany.",,,"Thum, Marcel/0000-0002-5071-7849",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [759-3],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We have received many very helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees.

The method calculates the upper bound of illiquidity spread of a corporate bond given its duration and the issuing firm's asset risk and leverage ratio. Consistent with the empirical literature the illiquidity spread is positively related to the issuing firm's asset risk and leverage ratio and the illiquidity component increases with a bond's credit quality. The term structure of illiquidity spread has a humped shape, where its maximum level depends on the firm's leverage ratio. Finally, we demonstrate how the method's implied restricted trading period can be used as a measure for illiquidity in the bonds' market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis has been focused on the patterns of new firm formation in Italian NUTS 3 regions using data on the creation of innovative start-ups that have followed the implementation of a new Italian regulation. The results of the analysis confirm that not only does the size of the knowledge stock play a key role in shaping the creation of innovative start-ups, but also the characteristics of such knowledge, in terms of variety and similarity.","[Colombelli, Alessandra] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Colombelli, Alessandra] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, GREDEG CNRS, Nice, France",Polytechnic University of Turin; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Colombelli, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",alessandra.colombelli@polito.it,,"COLOMBELLI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0003-4513-8612",,,,,62,77,82,2,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The economic intuition is simple: net debtor countries offer a currency risk premium to compensate investors willing to finance negative external imbalances because their currencies depreciate in bad times. This mechanism is consistent with exchange rate theory based on capital flows in imperfect financial markets. We also find that the global imbalance factor is priced in cross-sections of other major asset markets.,"[Della Corte, Pasquale] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Della Corte, Pasquale; Sarno, Lucio] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Riddiough, Steven J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Sarno, Lucio] City Univ London, London, England",Imperial College London; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Melbourne; City University London,"Sarno, L (通讯作者)，Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",Lucio.Sarno.1@city.ac.uk,,"Della Corte, Pasquale/0000-0003-4860-9512; Riddiough, Steven/0000-0002-5225-1755",INQUIRE Europe; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),INQUIRE Europe; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for comments and suggestions to Geert Bekaert (Editor), three anonymous referees, Rui Albuquerque, Nicola Borri, Justinas Brazys, Craig Burnside, Alejandro Cunat, Antonio Diez de los Rios, Carlo Favero, Xavier Gabaix, Federico Gavazzoni, Nicola Gennaioli, Leonid Kogan, Ralph Koijen, Matteo Maggiori, Lukas Menkhoff, Michael Moore, David Ng, Fulvio Ortu, Maik Schmeling, Astrid Schornick, Giulia Sestieri, Andreas Stathopoulos, Ilias Tsiakas, and Adrien Verdelhan.

We suggest that venture capitalists (VCs) may serve as a mechanism to mitigate contractual hazards and act as a substitute for equity sharing in joint ventures. This article is to our knowledge the first to address the impact of VC on governance decisions for start-ups. We analyse 5405 bilateral collaborations from the SDC database for the period 2009-2014 and find that VC-backed firms are less likely to share equity in collaborations. In a subset of 564 VC-backed firms, start-ups are less likely to choose a joint venture as a governance structure in comparison with established firms. When firms are backed by a larger number of VCs, they are also less likely to share equity in a collaboration. This article improves our understanding of the effect of VC on governance decisions in inter-firm relations and presents evidence of a trade-off between joint venture equity and VC equity in the formation of collaborations. It also shows that this trade-off becomes even more substantial when syndication of VCs is present.","[Jolink, Albert] Coventry Univ, Coventry Business Sch, Priory St, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Niesten, Eva] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",Coventry University; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Jolink, A (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Coventry Business Sch, Priory St, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",albert.jolink@coventry.ac.uk; eva.niesten@manchester.ac.uk,"Jolink, Albert/AAA-9417-2022; Niesten, Eva/AAA-8849-2022","Jolink, Albert/0000-0002-8823-1748; Niesten, Eva/0000-0002-9497-7263",,,,,48,10,11,2,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The DV was instituted by an Act of the United States Congress to diversify the U.S. population through a lottery made available to people from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the country. In any given year, the probability of winning the lottery is less than 1%, with millions of people from around the world competing for a maximum of 55,000 immigrant visas that can be obtained through this migration channel. Using Ethiopian DV participants, which have consistently made up between 6% and 8% of all DV immigrants, I study the causal effects of emigration on the well-being of the migrant sending families. I infer that migration contributes positively to the welfare of the source families. Overall, migration increases consumer expenditure, but has no effect on savings and business ownership of the senders. The positive treatment effects do not diminish with duration of emigration. Migrant men contribute more to the increase in their families' standard of living than their female counterparts do: while expenditure on food and energy are invariant to the migrants' gender, the gains in terms of durable ownership, access to clean water, and sanitation facilities occur almost entirely in families where the emigrants are men. I find that DV participants are favorably selected relative to the overall population. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We document that the worst earnings news is announced on Friday evening and find robust evidence that only Friday evening announcements represent managers' rational opportunistic behavior. Friday evening announcements are followed by insider trading in the direction of earnings news and the largest post-earnings announcement drift. Managers also attempt to reduce interaction with investors and hide more than just earnings news by announcing on Friday evening.

Especially, we explore how this result is driven by the uncertainty faced by MFIs in their location decision i.e., they can hardly predict accurately whether or not they will perform financially. Furthermore, we find that MFIs are spatially clustered and identify three main reasons for this: common attraction factors i.e., the characteristics of one area fits to the preferences of all MFIs so that they are all located in the same areas; payoff externalities to be collocated; and herd behavior, i.e., MFIs follow one another. Most importantly, we find that a significant part of this herding process is rational, i.e., early locations of MFIs convey information used by later ones such that it reverses or neutralizes the negative impact of uncertainty resulting then in more locations in needier areas. Since it allows them to be located in poorer areas, MFIs improve the achievement of their social goal. This latter result is rather good news for those who reckon that a better access to financial services enhances economic growth and fosters poverty alleviation. Indeed, rational herding constitutes an endogenous moderator effect to the big issue that financial services penetration is too weak in the poorest rural areas. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After a group of tests verifying that ATR indeed represents speculative trading, we show that ATR negatively predicts future stock returns. The average monthly return spread between the top and bottom ATR deciles is -1.87%, suggesting a highly significant negative ATR premium.

This research was undertaken to provide guidance for agricultural development programs on how to incorporate gender and assets in the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions. This paper synthesizes the findings of eight mixed-method evaluations of the impacts of agricultural development projects on individual and household assets in seven countries in Africa and South Asia. The results show that assets both affect and are affected by projects, indicating that it is both feasible and important to consider assets in the design, implementation, and evaluation of projects. All projects were associated with increases in asset levels and other benefits at the household level; however, only four projects documented significant, positive impacts on women's ownership or control of some types of assets relative to a control group, and of those only one project provided evidence of a reduction in the gender asset gap. The quantitative and qualitative findings suggest ways that greater attention to gender and assets by researchers and development implementers could improve outcomes for women in future projects.

Estimation results show the existence of considerable embodied technical progress and interindustry externalities of capital investments positively affecting productivity growth. Furthermore, embodied technical progress causes research and development (R&D) capital to affect productivity growth insignificantly, suggesting that the impact of R&D is realized only after being embodied into other capitals.

First, it exhibits the relationship between land and income distribution by developing a theoretical model based on Harris and Todaro (1970) and Lewis (1954). High land inequality increases income Gini coefficients in the urban sector as well as the rural sector, not only by creating congestion in the urban subsistence sector, but also by feeding the growth of the urban reserve army of labor, which pulls down the wages in the urban capitalist sector. Next, the study investigates the empirical relationship between land inequality, level of urbanization and income inequality using cross-country datasets. The estimation results support the theoretical model and indicate that the level of land inequality has a significant impact on determining the level of urbanization, and urban and overall income inequalities. Moreover, the analysis finds that overurbanization increases income inequality. The empirical analysis controls for institutional factors like education inequality and the level of democracy. The results present a stronger evidence on the land inequality's influence through urbanization than through education and democracy. These results suggest that policymakers should have a broader view as to the importance of agrarian policies. A progressive land reform or/and subsidies protecting small peasantry can also reduce urban income inequality and poverty over the long run. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This explained by changes on both the extensive and intensive margins by governments. While the decision to use conscription for military purposes has been studied extensively, in this paper we examine empirically the factors underlying the decline in the duration of military service obligations. Employing data from the Economic Freedom of the World index observed at 5-year intervals from 1970 to 2010, we find that the probability of a shorter military service time is positively associated with smaller country populations, smaller lagged army sizes, increases in primary schooling among young males, and having common law legal origins. Our empirical approach also highlights how the elderly population exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the length of conscriptees' time in uniform.","[Tarabar, Danko; Hall, Joshua C.] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Tarabar, D (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",datarabar@mix.wvu.edu; joshua.hall@mail.wvu.edu,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,Center for Free Enterprise at West Virginia University,Center for Free Enterprise at West Virginia University,"The authors would like to thank Adam Nowak for helpful comments and suggestions as well as attendees at the 2014 APEE, Public Choice, and WVU CFE Brown Bag.

This paper analyzes the trend of land use growth and developnient around the rail transit system mostly from 2000 to 2010. Primarily land parcel data collected from the assessor's office of several counties in the metro region have been used to determine change in the amount of different types of land use namely commercial, mixed, industrial, multi-family residential and single-family residential near and far from the rail transit system. Change has been analyzed in terms of total square footage of the building areas as well as land use density. Statistical significance tests (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test) have been conducted to understand if the amount of change taking place near the rail transit system is greater than away from the system. The growth of commercial land use was significantly higher near the rail transit system. More growth in multi-family residential land use has also occurred near the rail transit system, but was not significantly greater than areas away from the system. Single-family residential land use has noticeably increased in places away from the rail transit system. The other types of land use have not shown any consistent pattern in their growth either near or away from the system. Overall, a noticeable amount of land use change, especially commercial land use, has taken place around the rail transit system from 2000 to 2010. However, this change in land use cannot necessarily be attributed to the construction and operation of the rail transit system. Other factors may have influenced the growth of land use around the rail transit system more than the presence of the rail transit system itself. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we evaluate, using a dynamic general equilibrium model, the contribution of migration policy in reducing the tax burden associated with the ageing population in France. Four alternative scenarios, compared with a baseline scenario based on official projections, are simulated with the aim of quantifying the effects of immigration on French social protection finances. We show that the age and, to a lesser extent, the skill structure of immigrants are the key features that mainly determine the effects on social protection finances. Overall, these effects are all the more positive in the short to medium term if the migration policy is selective (in favour of more skilled workers). In the long term, the beneficial effects of a selective policy may disappear. But whatever the degree of selectivity of the migration policy, the financial gains from higher consequent migration flows are relatively moderate compared with the demographic changes implied by ageing.","[Chojnicki, Xavier] LEM CNRS, Paris, France; [Chojnicki, Xavier] Univ Lille, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Chojnicki, Xavier; Ragot, Lionel] CEPII, Paris, France; [Ragot, Lionel] Economix, Paris, France; [Ragot, Lionel] Univ Paris Ouest, Nanterre, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Lille; Universite Paris Saclay,"Chojnicki, X (通讯作者)，LEM CNRS, Paris, France.;Chojnicki, X (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, Villeneuve Dascq, France.;Chojnicki, X (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",xavier.chojnicki@univ-lille3.fr; lragot@u-paris10.fr,"Chojnicki, Xavier/AFQ-5884-2022",,"Mission Recherche (MiRe) of Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et des Statistiques (DREES)","Mission Recherche (MiRe) of Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et des Statistiques (DREES)","The authors thank Agnes Benassy-Quere, Gunther Capelle-Blancard, Christophe Destais, Jean-Christophe Dumont and Hillel Rapoport for helpful comments and discussions.

How much should we expect?,ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE COSTS,"In July 2014 a group of 14 countries (the 'Davos Group') launched negotiations on liberalizing trade in 'green goods' (also known as environmental goods - EGs), focusing on the elimination of tariffs for a list of 54 products. With an average tariff of 1.8 per cent, this group has little to offer even if the list were extended to the 411 products on the 'WTO list'. Taking into account tariff dispersion, their tariff structure on EGs would be equivalent to a uniform tariff of 3.4 per cent, about half the uniform tariff-equivalent for non EGs products. Enlarging the number of participants to low-income countries might be possible as, on average, their imports would not increase by more than 8 per cent. Because of the strong complementarities between trade in EGs and trade in environmental services, these should also be brought into the negotiation in spite of the likely difficulties in reaching agreement on their scope.","[de Melo, Jaime] FERDI, 63 Blvd Francois Mitterand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Vijil, Mariana] DG Treasury, Paris, France; [Vijil, Mariana] FERDI, Paris, France",,"de Melo, J (通讯作者)，FERDI, 63 Blvd Francois Mitterand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.;Vijil, M (通讯作者)，DG Treasury, Paris, France.;Vijil, M (通讯作者)，FERDI, Paris, France.",Jaime.de_melo@ferdi.fr; marianavijil@yahoo.fr,,,FERDI,FERDI,"The authors thank Gaelle Balineau, Ian Gillson, Bernard Hoekman, Sebastien Miroudot, Aymeric Pontvianne, Jehan Sauvage, Gisele Schmid and Ronald Steenblik and three referees for comments.

Not surprisingly, there is increased research towards better understanding of the contributing factors for BSS demand. However, these research efforts have neglected to adequately consider spatial and temporal interaction of BSS station's demand (arrivals and departures). It is possible that bicycle arrival and departure rates of one BSS station are potentially inter connected with bicycle flow rates for neighboring stations. It is also plausible that the arrival and departure rates at one time period are influenced by the arrival and departure rates of earlier time periods for that station and neighboring stations. Neglecting the presence of such effects, when they are actually present will result in biased model estimates. The major objective of this study is to accommodate for spatial and temporal effects (observed and unobserved) for modelling bicycle demand employing data from New York City's bicycle-sharing system (CitiBike). Towards this end, spatial error and spatial lag models that accommodate for the influence of spatial and temporal interactions are estimated. The exogenous variables for these models are drawn from BSS infrastructure, transportation network infrastructure, land use, point of interests, and meteorological and temporal attributes. The results provide strong evidence for the presence of spatial and temporal dependency for BSS station's arrival and departure rates. A hold out sample validation exercise further emphasizes the improved accuracy of the models with spatial and temporal interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce asset choice and sovereign debt holdings in banks' portfolios in an otherwise standard macroeconomic model with financial frictions, to emphasize a new crowding-out mechanism through reduced private access to credit when leverage-constrained banks accumulate sovereign debt. When banks are substantially invested in sovereign debt, the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli is impaired because deficit-financed fiscal expansions through this channel crowd out private demand. This channel also significantly reduces the gains from fiscal policy when interest rates are at the Zero Lower Bound. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, even though the remaining MENA stock markets of Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have matured and are now financially integrated with the world stock markets, they tend to exhibit more vulnerability to regional and international financial crises.

These two models are identical in all respects except for the presence of illiquidity in the underlying asset. Using various liquidity measures, the empirical results reveal a clear link between stock liquidity and option pricing. Specifically, adding a stock liquidity adjustment into an option pricing model produces smaller and more stable pricing errors for all comparison groups. The improvement rate is particularly high for options on stocks with lower liquidity and for out-of-the-money options. Our results are robust across liquidity measures and evaluation criteria. These findings highlight the significance of accounting for the stock liquidity when pricing options. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A negative shock to one market increases the probability of adverse shocks to other markets. We model this contagion effect by including mutually exciting jump processes in the dynamics of the indexes' log-returns. On top of this we add a stochastic volatility component to the dynamics. It is important to take the contagion effect into account if derivatives written on a basket of assets are to be priced or hedged. Due to the affine model specification the joint characteristic function of the log-returns is known analytically, and for two specifications we detail how the model can be calibrated efficiently to option prices. In total we calibrate over an extended period of time the specifications to options data on four US stock indexes, and show how the models achieve satisfactory pricing errors. We study the effect of contagion on multi-asset derivatives prices and show how for certain derivatives the impact is heavy. Moreover, we derive hedge ratios for European put and call options and perform a numerical experiment, which illustrates the impact of contagious jumps on option prices and hedge ratios. Mutually exciting processes have been analyzed for multivariate intensity modeling for the purpose of credit derivatives pricing, but have not been used for pricing/hedging options on equity indexes.

A time series analysis, within an econometric system-that rendered stationarity and used the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimator, was performed to model these movements. The analysis represents a natural experiment on the variability of cross-border truck movements in the aftermath of 9/11. Annual truck crossing data over the period 19722011, disaggregated by the country of registration (US and Canada) and Canadian jurisdictions (provinces) were used in the analysis. The results indicate that in general, 9/11 have had a negative effect on the cross border movement of Canadian and US trucks, but the impacts were more pronounced in the case of the US trucks. Other interesting results include an increase in the number of US trucks during the period that followed the last US financial crisis. The results also illustrate the importance of GDP in explaining the observed truck movements across the Canada-US border. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We posit that comparability decreases with RPTs where much management discretion is likely to be involved in determining volume and terms. In addition, firms conducting RPTs are more likely to make accounting choices which make their accounting information less comparable to their industry peers to prevent government detection of illegal RPTs. Using a unique data-set on RPTs among firms listed on the Korean stock market, we provide evidence consistent with our prediction. Specifically, by defining three different measures of annual RPTs; (1) size of RPTs, (2) volatility of RPTs, and (3) size of non-cash RPTs, we find that financial statement comparability decreases as RPTs increase for all three measures of RPTs.

For the study, a survey was conducted including measures of commuting habits, attitudes (toward the congestion charge, the environment, automobility, and public transport), and satisfaction with travel, along with socio-demographic and geographical variables. The survey was distributed to a panel of 3500 car owners in the Gothenburg region before the implementation of the scheme, with a follow-up one year later. The analysis use group comparisons and a binary logistic regression analysis and results show that the difference in accessibility of different societal functions using private versus public transport affected the propensity to reduce car travel, whereas socio-demographic variables had a low statistical significance, with the exception of women who were twice as likely to reduce their car travel than men. All studied groups reported a more positive view of the scheme at follow-up, although this effect was more pronounced among those adapting their commuting behavior. In none of the studied groups did the implementation of the congestion charge scheme correlate with any significant change in satisfaction with travel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find the absence of a homogeneous convergence club. The results for FDI outflows also reach similar conclusions, suggesting the formation of convergence clubs by stage of development. These results suggest that policies that promote convergence in trade openness and FDI flows would permit countries to benefit from mutual interactions and by greater consistency and efficiency in trade regimes, thus permitting these countries to benefit from openness leading to a race to the top rather than bottom.

In this paper we contribute to the analysis of one component of the national systems of entrepreneurship (namely capital market frictions) by showing that in the extreme scenario of deep recession efficiency in resource reallocation can actually be reduced. Using data from the pronounced Portuguese economic crisis, we do find a spike in firm exit in 2008-2012 vis-A -vis the 2004-2007 pre-crisis period, and a substantial increase in job destruction as well. But we did not find any strong evidence that job reallocation is countercyclical, while a non-negligible fraction of high-productivity firms actually shut down. In turn, our selected proxies for strictness in credit markets reveal that in deep recessions they are seemingly associated with increased firm exit and lower employment creation. Taken in round, our results show that credit market stringency in conjunction with an unfavourable economic cycle is likely to generate a long-lasting destructive process.","[Carreira, Carlos; Teixeira, Paulino] Univ Coimbra, GEMF, Av Dr Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Carreira, Carlos; Teixeira, Paulino] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Av Dr Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Carreira, C (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, GEMF, Av Dr Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.;Carreira, C (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Av Dr Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",ccarreir@fe.uc.pt; pteixeira@fe.uc.pt,"Carreira, Carlos/B-6139-2009; Teixeira, Paulino/E-7695-2011","Carreira, Carlos/0000-0002-4786-5605; Teixeira, Paulino/0000-0002-1285-6776",,,,,45,26,26,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We conducted a field experiment in which students from an Italian University are proposed to choose between two exam schemes: a standard scheme without time pressure and an alternative scheme consisting of two written intermediate tests, one of which to be taken under time pressure. Students deciding to sustain the alternative exam are randomly assigned to a time pressure and a no time pressure group. Students performing under time pressure at the first test perform in absence of time pressure at the second test and vice versa. We find that being exposed to time pressure exerts a negative and statistically significant impact on students' performance. The effect is driven by a strong negative impact on females' performance, while there is no statistically significant effect on males. Both the quantity and quality of females' work is hampered by time pressure. Using data on students' expectations, we also find that the effect produced by time pressure on performance was correctly perceived by students. Female students expect a lower grade when working under time pressure, while males do not. These findings contribute to explain why women tend to shy away from jobs and careers involving time pressure. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the influence of a changing dependency ratio has on the time individuals spend in education and production. Longer education will increase productivity in the future, but will lower production in the short run, whereas an increase in labour input at the cost of education will provide more production immediately. We introduce a dependency ratio into a discrete-time Uzawa-Lucas model with international capital movements, human capital externalities and decreasing returns to labour in human capital formation. The dependency ratio is defined as the fraction between inactive and active individuals in regard to work or education. By calibration of the model, we find multiple steady states indicated by a u-shaped relation between education time-shares and the growth rate of the dependency ratio. Near the stable, high-level steady state, the optimal response to higher growth of the dependency ratio is more education to enhance productivity. We find evidence for this relation for 16 OECD countries. As a model extension, a debt-dependent interest rate has been introduced and estimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The study employs Case/Shiner monthly house price index data for 19 MSAs from 1992:06 to 2014:12 and FHFA quarterly house price index data for 94 MSAs from 1992:3 to 2014:4. We model the importance of MSA-specific demand and supply characteristics through a set of interaction terms between these factors and monetary policy. The empirical analysis is cast in terms of a state-space approach with a stochastic trend component to absorb the impact of omitted variables. Robustness checks use panel data estimators with interaction terms. A lower federal funds rate is associated with home price run-ups in MSAs that are characterized by higher demand and tighter supply conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The equilibrium price dynamics are explicit, which allows simple numerical simulations and generates testable implications. In particular, we find that the equilibrium price of insurance is (weakly) predictable and the insurance sector always realises positive expected profits.

The estimation of the borrowing function reveals that SME zombie firms did not change their loans in response to a change in land values due to evergreening.

Previous work has largely focused on two models - a core model of rewarding loyal supporters and a swing model of purchasing the support of easily swayed voters. Empirical results have proven mixed, however. In this article, we argue that these mixed results are due to economic factors, which condition politicians' distributive strategies. In our model, we consider that politician and voters are involved in a repeated game, where past expectations condition future strategy. Current (core) supporters who receive few benefits and perceive themselves worse off than other, less loyal, groups are likely to be less loyal themselves tomorrow. In our model, politicians avoid this by providing their supporters consumption benefits directly, in the form of transfers, or indirectly, via strong economic growth. Where economic growth is good, politicians can distribute less to core supporters, who benefit from the rising economy. Where economic growth is weak, however, politicians make transfers to their core supporters to ensure future loyalty. We test our theory using data on federal transfers from the Russian Federal government to 78 Russian Regions from 2000-2008.","[Marques, Israel, II] Columbia Univ, Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nazrullaeva, Eugenia] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Yakovlev, Andrei] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Inst Ind & Market Studies, Moscow 119017, Russia",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Marques, I (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Moscow 119017, Russia.;Marques, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, 17 Malaya Ordynka, Moscow 119017, Russia.",imarques@hse.ru,"Yakovlev, Andrei/JXL-6362-2024; Yakovlev, Andrei/H-8166-2013; Marques II, Israel/O-7288-2016","Yakovlev, Andrei/0000-0003-2273-0971; Yakovlev, Andrei/0000-0003-2273-0971; Marques II, Israel/0000-0003-4027-6645; Nazrullaeva, Eugenia/0000-0001-9995-7205",Government of the Russian Federation,Government of the Russian Federation,"This article was prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and supported within the framework of a subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.

The existing literature focuses on full-time workers, but the replacement of low-paid regular full-time workers by non-regular workers and the introduction of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law may have changed the selection of females in full-time work force. I consider a three choice framework for a woman based on the Roy model: a woman chooses either no work, non-regular work, or regular work. This framework shows that large (potential) wage inequality within a gender can draw high-earning people into the workforce and push low-earning people out. I apply Lee's (1983) method to the micro data from the Employment Social Surveys 1992 and 2002. The results show that female selection in regular workers became stricter in 2002 and women with low-earning ability tended to be pushed out from regular work force. The wage structure for female regular workers has become more ability based. This change in the female selection explains 63.27% of the observed convergence in the mean log wage gap between female regular workers and male workers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In order to achieve this aim a qualitative marketing research was conducted, by applying in-depth semi-structured interviews. The target group of the research consisted of nine banking companies, selected according to the market share, while the research participants were employees responsible for marketing, sales and customer relationship management activities. Due to respondents' expertise, during the interviews could be applied mixed research methods in the process of data collection and subsequently, in data analysis. According to research objectives and results, although there is an increase in the importance of customer orientation within banking policies, the integration of relationship marketing optics at the institutional management level is facing a number of deficiencies, especially with regard to the concerns about employees' satisfaction and loyalty or to the development of relationships with other stakeholders. The degree of satisfaction with the adoption of customer relationship management technology is relatively high among banks, being appreciated mainly those banking performance achieved in terms of retention rate, cross-selling and customer satisfaction. Most banks use the gross customer retention index as the main indicator of customer portfolio stability, although retention objectives tend to be set differently depending on customer value. Internal marketing strategies are developed around staff training processes, while performance evaluation criteria are rather specific to a transactional marketing approach. Results of the research provide clues on the relationship marketing processes and activities that need to be improved, in order to strengthen the current customer base and the competitive position in the banking industry.","[Filip, Alina; Vranceanu, Diana Maria; Georgescu, Bogdan; Marinescu, Daniela Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Filip, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",filip.alina@gmail.com,"Diana, Vranceanu/E-1737-2013; Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021","Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244",,,,,28,4,6,1,25,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18.0,41,,,,,199,214,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100014,0

Both theory and evidence point to such power as a key factor that affects the ability of a tourism resort to pass along local taxes to gambling visitors. This ability makes all the difference between the good or bad effect of casino taxes on tourism development. The policy implication is that a gaming tax should be lowered to support casino businesses if it is inefficient, but can be raised to extract public revenues if it is efficient.","[Gu, Xinhua; Tam, Pui Sun; Lei, Chun Kwok; Chang, Xiao] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, E22,Avenida Univ, Taipa, Morocco",University of Macau,"Tam, PS; Chang, X (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, E22,Avenida Univ, Taipa, Morocco.",pstam@umac.mo,"Lei, CK Chun Kwok/HNC-3630-2023; Tam, Pui Sun/AAN-2474-2020","Tam, Pui Sun/0000-0002-9790-2910; CHANG, Xiao/0000-0003-1391-2490; Lei, Chun Kwok/0000-0002-8939-4194","Research Committee of the University of Macau [MYRG081-FBA11-GXH, MYRG014-FBA13-TPS]",Research Committee of the University of Macau,The authors are grateful to the Research Committee of the University of Macau for financial support (under grant MYRG081-FBA11-GXH and grant MYRG014-FBA13-TPS).,,30,4,6,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

While recognising the sufficiency of democracy, we argue that it is accountability, achievable outside full democracy, that is the necessary component of governance. However, vague conceptualisations of accountability as responsiveness' or answerability' have prevented empirical work from exploring the relationship between accountability and public spending.

First, the term family entrepreneurship based on foreign and domestic sources is defined. The sources are complemented by a legal viewpoint under the new Civil Code of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, a regional definition of a municipality and the country is specified. Then, a result of the research investigation focused on the link between the family entrepreneurship and economic development of communities is presented. Finally, the next steps of the team at the Faculty of Economics, Technical University of Liberec in the given area are unveiled. The novel idea is to use such a tool that allows its residents to find the meaning of life in the country and accept a certain level of inequality associated with it. Just at this moment, regional disparities can be removed and support for the development of rural areas can be successfully implemented.

Methodology/methods We conducted the study by using the methods of statistical survey, grouping and analysis: relative-value, mean-value, time series and statistical variation introduction methods. The trend was identified by using simple methods, such as average absolute increase and mean annual growth rate and linear function as an analytical method. Scientific aim The scientific aim of the paper is to determine and calculate the coefficient of integration of Georgia with the world economy, as the total aggregated mean arithmetic value of the mean values of the percentages of the integration coefficient values in gross domestic product for each factor calculated in dynamics. Findings It was found that the coefficient of integration of Georgia with the world economy was 20,2% in the considered period. If considering that the percentage value of this coefficient may vary from 0 to 100. It should be considered that we evaluated the level of integration of the countries by using a three-step scale based on an equal-interval grouping: I. Low (0-33%); II. Average (33,3-66,6%), and III. High (66,6%-100%). As the integration coefficient of Georgia in the world economy in 2008-2014 was 20,2%, this means that Georgia realized only 20,2% of its foreign economic relations potential in this period. Conclusions In general, it should be noted that the degree of integration of Georgia in the world economy is quite low and has deteriorated since 2003-2008. As per our calculations, it has decreased by 1,1%. As it turns out, the reduction of the index of integration was mostly the result of the reduced share of investments in GDP.","[Abesadze, Nino] I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Abesadze, N (通讯作者)，I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia.",ninka_abesadze@yahoo.com,"Abesadze, Nino/AAD-6942-2022","Abesadze, Nino/0000-0002-6564-2771",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,255,260,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200030,0

Methodology/methods The study used methods of statistical survey, grouping and analysis: mean-value, time series and prediction. Leveling and prediction were done by simple methods based on average absolute increase and mean annual growth rate.

Scientific aim Scientific aim of the paper was to thoroughly analyze criteria needed for EU-association, such as GDP per capita, unemployment and inflation rates, percentage value of country's total foreign debt to GDP, indicators of state budgetary deficit, calculate predictive values of each indicator and identify expected trends of approaching EU countries. Findings Of the major indicators for EU-association, Georgia is likely to meet three: the share of foreign debt will not exceed 60% of GDP, inflation rate will be maintained as single-digit and joint budgetary deficit will not exceed 3% of GDP. As for other two requirements, GDP per capita of 10-12 thousand USD and maximum 10% rate of unemployment, Georgia is unlikely to meet them. Conclusions Thus, of the requirements for Georgia to integrate with EU, the country will likely to reach three: rate of inflation will be maintained as single digit, joint budget deficit will not exceed 3% of GDP and foreign debt of the country will not exceed 60% of GDP. As for other criteria, their major indicators in Georgia still fall back EU countries.","[Abesadze, Otar] I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Abesadze, O (通讯作者)，I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia.",o.abesadze@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,261,266,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200031,0

Using data from both before and within crisis sub-periods, we provide evidence that borrower's and lender's own liquidity status has a significant impact on overnight rates, both before and during the turmoil periods. We first review the literature focused on the role of liquidity risk in the recent interbank turmoil. We then implement an integrative LSDV estimation to assess the determinants of e-MID overnight rates. In these regressions, we put together measures of the three types of factors that have received theoretical and empirical support, namely, counter party risk, liquidity factors and market imperfections. We find that even when counterparty risk and market imperfections are controlled for, banks with higher funding liquidity risk pay an interest rate premium. We show that this is probably explained by hoarding and short-squeezing behavior of liquidity-long banks. These phenomena disappeared when the ECB launched its full allotment policy in October 2008.

We study the characteristics of the matching process between universities and innovative firms that makes this exchange in technology transfer (TT) either efficient or unfeasible. We show that the functioning of the TT market implies dual-trading externalities. These arise because there is a high probability that a firm searching for a university collaboration will not meet a suitable researcher, and another positive probability that an unemployed researcher will not find a suitable innovative firm, whatever the market prices and the costs are.

This study investigates the merits of CEO mandatory retirement policies (MRPs) using a sample of 12,610 firm-year observations from 2143 unique firms. It also addresses the question of whether CEO age is relevant to the success of an organization. We fail to find consistent evidence that MRPs are intended to limit CEO entrenchment. MRPs are, however, positively associated with CEO age and negatively associated with firm-specific human capital. Further analysis reveals that CEO age is significantly negatively related to firm value, operating performance, and corporate deal-making activity. Splitting our sample according to whether an MRP is in place, we observe that the negative impact of age exists only for those firms which do not have MRPs. We therefore conclude that MRPs represent an effective form of firm governance designed to mitigate the underperformance of older CEOs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, if there is a global pollutant, free-riding will arise if individuals calculate that their emissions are negligible relative to the total, so total emissions and hence any damage that they and others suffer will be unaffected by whatever consumption choice they make. In this context consumer behaviour and the optimal environmental tax are independent of the degree of altruism. For behaviour to change, individuals need to make their decisions in a different way. We propose a new theory of moral behaviour whereby individuals recognise that they will be worse off by not acting in their own self-interest, and balance this cost off against the hypothetical moral value of adopting a Kantian form of behaviour, that is by calculating the consequences of their action by asking what would happen if everyone else acted in the same way as they did. We show that: (a) if individuals behave this way, then altruism matters and the greater the degree of altruism the more individuals cut back their consumption of a 'dirty' good; (b) nevertheless the optimal environmental tax is exactly the same as that emerging from classical analysis where individuals act in self-interested fashion.","[Daube, Marc; Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AR, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Ulph, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AR, Fife, Scotland.",mpl@st-andrews.ac.uk; du1@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500136/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [1223291] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Marc Daube gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council, grant number ES/J500136/1.",,38,26,26,3,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses five in-depth case studies of medium-sized enterprises in the Yangtze River Delta region to study their behaviors over the 2000-2012 period during which the institutional landscape in China underwent major changes. Findings - The authors find that when institutional complexity is high, i.e., when neither the planned economy nor the market economy logic dominates, the role of organizational filters is more pronounced. In this situation, firm-level characteristics - its revenues and profitability, its competitive position and future prospects - play a dominant role in determining the nature of the strategic decisions and actions the firm undertakes. Research limitations/implications - The findings provide a nuanced perspective on strategic behaviors under institutional complexity. The qualitative research design offers rich insights but limited generalizability. Practical implications - The findings offer practical insights to SME leaders in terms of exercising caution in undertaking unrelated diversification during periods of transition from planned to market economies. Originality/value - The authors apply the concepts of institutional complexity and organizational filters in a context of large scale institutional transitions to study the strategic behaviors of SMEs over a 12 year period.","[Ding, Yuan] CEIBS, Dept Finance & Accounting, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Malleret, Veronique] HEC Paris, Dept Accounting & Control, Paris, France; [Velamuri, S.

We have done a hierarchy of these criteria elaborated by Rogers (2003), according to their importance as it is perceived by the Romanian adopters which have implemented projects of technological development. The five characteristics surveyed are (Rogers, 2003): (1) Relative advantage of the innovation; (2) Compatibility; (3) Complexity; (4) Trialability; (5) Observability. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the fact that, for a certain innovation, the general characteristics play a different role in the process of adoption or rejection of the technology. The conducted research is a descriptive one (by the nature of the analytical methods used), and it allows the outlining of some clear characteristics on the common perception of the characteristics underlying technology diffusion process. Specifically, the following objectives were targeted: (1) an AHP analysis regarding the importance that the characteristics of a particular technology show when it comes to the adoption process; (2) identification of potential differences on the general perception depending on the region of residence of the companies. The main method of investigation used to obtain the necessary data for the AHP analysis was the telephone interview. This was based on a predefined questionnaire, and it only pursued some key aspects needed to run the analysis. The results suggest the fact that the relative advantage is the strongest predictor of the diffusion rate of a particular technology. Also, there are clear differences between the observed units if we take into consideration the regions of provenance. These differences are present in both the rate of consent and the hierarchy of the criteria analyzed by the AHP method. The research brings a significant contribution in the area of the diffusion of technology, by the realized ranking itself which can be exploited by the suppliers of new products on the market with the purpose of improving the diffusion rate. At the same time, based on our results, people can outline industrial marketing strategies, which come to meet the consumers' needs, according to the importance perceived by them.","[Drenta, Raul Florentin; Lobontiu, Gabriela] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, 62A Dr Victor Babes St, Baia Mare 430083, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Drenta, RF (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, 62A Dr Victor Babes St, Baia Mare 430083, Romania.",drenta.raul@gmail.com; gabriela.lobontiu@cunbm.utcluj.ro,"Drenta, Raul/AAN-7201-2020; Lobontiu, Gabriela/AAA-4677-2019",,,,,,22,0,0,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,575,585,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300047,0

These programs were designed to channel liquidity to some of the largest institutions, most of which were primary dealers. We describe these programs, examine available evidence regarding their effectiveness, and detail which institutions received the largest amounts under each program. We argue that increasing financial fragility and potential insolvencies in several major institutions were evident prior to the crisis. While it is inherently difficult to disentangle issues of illiquidity from issues of insolvency, failure to recognize and address those insolvency problems delayed necessary adjustments, undermined confidence in the financial system, and may have exacerbated the crisis.","[Eisenbeis, R.

Principals' control of teachers' activities also adversely affects satisfaction, suggesting that, in Malagasy schools, neither school directors nor teachers have succeeded in adopting organisational cultures based on cooperation among their members.

This nearest neighbor framework allows for both idiosyncratic property-specific effects and for common location effects in constructing sale pairs. The distinguishing feature of our model is that a significant percentage of discarded (non-repeat sale) observations are utilized. Like the repeat sales approach, the availability of housing attributes is not required to implement our model, in contrast to other hybrid models. The only additional calculation required is pairwise distances, which are used in lieu of property attributes in hybrid models. Our resulting model is not only parsimonious but also produces relatively tighter pricing interval estimates. A key advantage of our approach is that it can be used to obtain price estimates in thin markets and smaller cities that have relatively fewer transactions.","[Guntermann, Karl L.] Arizona State, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Liu, Crocker] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nowak, Adam D.] W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA",Cornell University; West Virginia University,"Guntermann, KL (通讯作者)，Arizona State, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Liu, C (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Nowak, AD (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",karl.guntermann@asu.edu; chl62@cornell.edu; adam.d.nowak@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,4,5,1,3,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The increasing opportunity to use big data for improving and expanding index insurance is also addressed.

Using the PSID database for the United States (1970-2009), we first decompose total inequality into these components. Then, we specify a dynamic model that relates each inequality component to a set of macroeconomic factors. Apart from real GDP and inflation rates, the most widely used factors in the literature, we also consider outstanding consumer credits and public welfare and health care expenditures. We find that real GDP and outstanding credits have a negative and significant effect upon IO and IE, while inflation has a positive and significant effect only on IE, and welfare expenditures have a negative and significant effect only on IO.","[Marrero, Gustavo A.] Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ, Tenerife, Spain; [Gabriel Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal 1, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Complutense University of Madrid,"Marrero, GA (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ, Tenerife, Spain.",,"Marrero, Gustavo A./A-4745-2008","Marrero, Gustavo A./0000-0003-4030-0078; RODRIGUEZ, JUAN GABRIEL/0000-0002-0256-8789","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [ECO2013-48884-C3-3-P, ECO2013-46516-C4-4-R]; Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) [S2015/HUM-3416-DEPOPORCM]; Fundacion Caja Canarias (Spain); Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Spain)",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid (Spain)(Comunidad de Madrid); Fundacion Caja Canarias (Spain); Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Spain),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain: Marrero through project ECO2013-48884-C3-3-P and Rodriguez through project ECO2013-46516-C4-4-R.

In particular, we argue that each type of slack and attention has a different impact on firm performance and that slack reflects that specific endowment of intellectual capital, usable to foster performance and growth. We use the market to book value to measure both firm performance and, indirectly, the endowment of intellectual capital. This ratio is largely employed as a proxy measure for intellectual capital: the value of intellectual capital is roughly equal to the gap between the market and the book value. Organizational slack is a cushion of excess resources, upon which the firm could rely in case of uncertainty. We group slack types according to the easy-of-recovery taxonomy. We also consider organizational attention, a further expression of intellectual capital. Overall attention is given by the sum of the attention toward the internal environment and toward the external environment. We test our hypotheses on a sample of large companies operating in the energy market. Our findings show a significant positive relationship between the market to book ratio and both the unabsorbed and potential slack, which reflect, respectively, the organizational capital and the relational capital available for investing in firm growth. On the converse, the absorbed slack has a moderate influence on this gap (it is a measure of organizational capital hardly recoverable for new investments). Consistently with the model, attention is negatively related to the market to book value. In fact, it represents all those expenses made to reduce the discrepancy between the market to book value. However, those expenses reduce the firm's potential of making new investments, since they are resources already allocated in previous projects and almost unrecoverable.","[Orlando, Beatrice; Renzi, Antonio; Sancetta, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Orlando, B (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",beatrice.orlando@uniroma1.it; antonio.renzi@uniroma1.it; giuseppe.sancetta@uniroma1.it,"Renzi, Antonio/AAT-7683-2020",,,,,,40,0,1,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,186,193,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300024,0

One discussed part is customer education and the knowledge that can arise from different sources (not necessary connected to energy providers), such as dynamic experience and opinion sharing. The second issue deliberated is the problem of knowledge management in energy utilities, which, thus far, have primarily been focused on technical solutions, with little attention paid to consumers. Purpose of the article The paper discusses the different types of KM platforms and presents a model of the process leading to customer engagement in energy market solutions. The model is focused on changing the supplier-customer relationship, as well as the activities of utility company, which possess the initiating role in creating active customer participation in new offers and programs. Methodology/methods The research methodologies used for smart grid knowledge management platforms consideration is a review of the current literature and the author's own experience, gathered from European projects: Synergy+ and SEESGENT-ICT-both related to the design of smart grid platforms (Synergy + for SME project consortium supporting, SEESGENT-ICT for energy market stakeholders). The proposed model was created based on the results of a survey conducted in 2013 in central Poland. The main objective of the study was to assess the current attitudes of Polish residential customers towards the new energy demand programs and active energy market participation. Scientific aim The first aim of the paper is to present the different perspectives for smart grid knowledge management platforms for smart grid customers. The second is to present the challenges of utilities towards finding new customer-centric ICT knowledge-based solutions. Findings Utilities have to change their relations with customers. The demand for enhanced knowledge was confirmed by a local survey in central Poland. The important part of the process is the education of customers conducted by utility companies before and during the project of introducing new solutions (e.g. the installations of smart meters). A proactive information campaign can create greater customer engagement and avoid a negative reaction to pilot programs or regular Demand Side Management (DSM) offers. Passing on knowledge about planned activities and potential short term benefits to customers brings about greater interest in these changes and helps customers to move from passive to active energy market stake holders. Conclusions For energy utility companies, the transition to a new system is a huge, not only technological but also institutional, challenge. One of the conclusions that arises from the paper is that the new smart grid idea and its implemented technology require a new perspective on the company processes, linked to the delivery of services to customers, who are expected to be more active and become managers of both energy generation and consumption. Wide deployment of smart grid solutions will increase the need to educate customers and will force the utilities to implement a high level of knowledge management processes and systems.","[Pamula, Anna] Univ Lodz, Fac Mangament, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Pamula, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Mangament, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",apamula@wzmail.uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,9,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,489,498,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200061,0

Agricultural issues are one of the most difficult areas of the TTIP negotiation. It is due to the asymmetric level of protection of the agricultural markets of the EU and the US, associated with significant differences in the production potential of agriculture and food industry in these countries. The main aim of the paper is to present the current scale of tariff protection of agricultural markets in the EU and the US and to assess how the possible reduction of duties under the TTIP would influence the bilateral trade turnover between the parties of the Agreement. The results show that the average level of ad valorem duties imposed by the US was more than 2 times lower than in the EU. The rates of the MFN customs tariff varies depending on the group of products to be exchanged. Most agri-food sectors in the US were protected by relatively low duties, which usually did not exceed 6%. In the EU, the lowest tariff rates were found in import of products coming from other climate zones or products which were not in sufficient amounts in the EU (oilseeds; cereals; coffee and tea; live animals etc.). The highest tariffs were maintained by the EU in import of tobacco products; preparations of meat or of fish, as well as preparations of fruit and vegetables. The reduction of tariff protection of the US agricultural market should not lead to the strong creation effect in agri-food export from the EU to the US but it may result in a significant improvement in access to the EU market for products from the US. In fact, when reduction of tariffs is observed, greater benefits from liberalisation refer usually to the country that applied a lower level of protection before the establishment of free trade area.","[Pawlak, Karolina] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Wojska Polskiego St 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Wojska Polskiego St 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",pawlak@up.poznan.pl,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",,,,,21,4,4,0,9,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,244,250,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000031,0

Firms could avoid such additional taxes by paying extra dividends and accelerating dividends in the last 2 months of 2012. These tax avoiders are compared with a sample of firms that did not accelerate the payment of their first quarterly dividend from the first 3 months of 2013 to November or December 2012 (the deliberate taxpayers). Ceteris paribus, Republican CEOs are more likely to help their investors to save money on personal income taxes. However, the political affiliation has explanatory power in addition to previously documented effects (Hanlon and Hoopes, 2014), such as the consequences for the CEO's personal wealth as well as the percentage of insider holdings. Reputational concerns about avoiding taxes for the rich as well as corporate governance quality are also significant determinants of corporate behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When a creative idea is generated, its transformation into new knowledge depends on a cycle associating three subsystems and highlighting the link between idea and knowledge: the individual who generated the idea, the knowledge field which acts as a reference repository and the knowledge community who evaluates, selects and validates relevant ideas. Usual innovation dynamic is based on creative problem solving (from problem to solution). This paper covers the reversibility of the link idea-knowledge, that is to say the passage from knowledge to inventive idea. We promote an ab nihilo innovation dynamic (from ideation to innovation). In this paper, we propose an inventive idea generation method which takes advantage of the inventive intellectual Corpus of Knowledge actors. The research is dedicated to the epistemic connection between the structural analysis of knowledge contained in inventive intellectual Corpus and the ideation seen as inventive knowledge generation. Our methodology consists in building a theoretical representative model and in validating it through experimentation. Model's input data represent a cognitive stimulus and model's output data consist of a prospective vision. Cognitive stimulus is based on in-depth analysis of the texture of knowledge structuring the inventive intellectual Corpus. Results include experimental validation of the Knowledge Based Innovation approach. Our contribution consists in showing that ideation, stimulated by the critical analysis of the structure of knowledge lying in the knowledge actor's inventive intellectual Corpus, can be seen as an epistemic mutation, where source, process, results, corpus and knowledge actor can be assimilated as an unique entity.

Design/methodology/approach - The Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005) stationarity test with structural breaks is used to check the stationarity. The Westerlund (2006) panel co-integration test is employed to examine the long-run relationship among the variables. To carry out tests on the co-integrating vectors, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and PDOLS techniques are used and panel Granger causality test is used to examine the direction of the causality. Findings - The Westerlund (2006) panel co-integration test confirms the existence of the long-run relationship between financial development and economic growth for SAARC countries. The coefficients of FMOLS and DOLS indicate that index of financial development (IFD) and trade openness supports economic growth in SAARC region. In the short-run, there is unidirectional causality running from IFD to economic growth. Research limitations/implications - In the view of these findings it is recommended that countries in the region should adopt policies geared toward financial sector development to attain high economic growth. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, no studies have looked into SAARC countries to study the relationship between financial development and economic growth, this study is the first of its kind.","[Sehrawat, Madhu] TA Pai Management Inst, Dept Finance & Econ, Manipal, India; [Giri, A.

The unprecedented level of interdependence and interconnectedness between countries, firms and institutions has paved the way for the emergence of, both, novel practices that increase the quality of life and intriguingly complicated issues of global governance. The relationship between global actors are so intertwined that striving for predictability is barely feasible. In spite of the enhanced capabilities gained through involvement in the economic and financial value creation process, there are perils ahead for better global governance. Major issues pose global actors in terms of credibility, building and ensuring sustainability, erosion of capacity to fulfill promises and increasing fragility of financial markets as well as issues regarding depleting energy resources, environment and security. G-20 emerged as a remedial governance structure in the wake of the 2008 financial turmoil making sure that the prominent dynamic emerging countries are seated around the table. The expansion of G-8 into G-20 including the new global powerhouses has many positive implications. However, ongoing debates regarding this structure oscillate between hope and contestation. This conceptual paper intends to draw a general framework regarding the representative capability of G20 members and discuss the hybrid quality of this so called steering committee given the era of turbulence that the world is heading towards.

However, their foundation seems to be based on Ericsson's study on for example how musicians practice.

Combining an Ethiopian household survey with satellite-derived topographical information, the article shows that malaria incidence is correlated with village elevation, slope and their interaction; that is, malaria is sensitive to elevation in flatlands, where the habitat is suitable for mosquito breeding, but not in steeper lands. Using topography as a predictor of the disease environment, education levels are found to be negatively correlated with malaria.

We find that country-level factors explain a substantial fraction of the cross-sectional variation in insurance companies' capitalization levels. Our results add to the current policy discussion on global regulatory capital requirements. If insurer capital structure is not homogeneous across countries, a global capital standard if desired should take differences in the institutional environments across countries into account to avoid market distortions.

Based on real-life cases such as the EU ETS, we consider a multi-unit, multi-bid uniform auction. At the auction, each firm anticipates its role in the secondary market, either as a leader or a follower. This role affects each firms' valuation of the permits (which are not common across firms) as well as their bidding strategies and it precludes the auction from generating a cost-effective allocation of permits, as it occurs in simpler auction models. Auctioning tends to be more cost-effective than grandfathering when the firms' abatement cost functions are sufficiently different from one another, especially if the follower has lower abatement costs than the leader and the dispersion of the marginal costs is large enough.","[Alvarez, Francisco; Andre, Francisco J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Econ & EE, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac CC Econ & EE, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",andre@ccee.ucm.es,"Alvarez, Francisco/ABH-2320-2020; Andre, Francisco J./H-4613-2015","Alvarez, Francisco/0000-0003-0472-5255; Andre, Francisco J./0000-0002-6406-3305","Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2012-39553-C04-01]; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF [ECO2012-39553-C04-01]; Andalusian Regional Government [SEJ 04992, SEJ-6882]","Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF(European Union (EU)); Andalusian Regional Government","This paper has greatly benefited from comments and fruitful discussion with Michael Finus as well as the useful suggestions from Carmen Arguedas and two anonymous referees.

By employing a panel smooth transition regression model, the threshold level of the CIP deviation in which UIP tends to hold is found to be outside the band of inaction where deviations from CIP would fail to be arbitraged away. This paper shows how reversals of UIP observed during the global financial crisis can be, to some extent, accounted for by funding liquidity constraints.

We identify two conflicting effects. On the one hand, lower search costs increase incentives to invest in quality by eroding the market share of low quality firms and increasing the market share of high quality firms. On the other hand, by intensifying price competition, lower search costs adversely affect high quality firms more than low quality firms. The net effect of a change in the search cost on quality is shown to depend on the initial quality distribution. There is a critical value such that, if the proportion of high quality firms is initially below this value, lower search costs increase this proportion, whereas if the initial quality is above this value, lower search cost decreases the proportion of high quality firms.

We test whether economic policy decisions are subject to equivalency framing by presenting survey participants with binary risky-choice decisions in hypothetical policy scenarios. Potentially mediating influences of expertise on the framing effect are explored using responses of students and professionals. Expertise is thereby defined in line with common education and work experience criteria in the recruitment of public officials. We mostly find unidirectional framing effects in the economic policy scenarios and a similar susceptibility of respondents with different levels of expertise. A logistic regression of the expertise variables on the choice between certain and risky options reveals only the frame to have a systematically significant effect across scenarios. The results indicate that expertise may not necessarily help to make better policy choices under risk, if the available options are framed differently. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate excess returns before and after the onset of the most recent financial crisis. We find that while prior to August 2007 returns were indeed close to zero, afterwards returns jump back up to around 200 basis points. We surmise that in a booming credit market the certification of corporate borrowers by banks started to play a lesser role, while during the crisis the banks' role was revitalized.

This program provides direct rebates to all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles according to electric battery capacity. After describing the program, we identify and monetize its main costs and benefits. The costs are primarily related to the government expenses associated with the rebate itself, while the benefits include savings on gasoline purchases and oil changes, as well as reductions in the emissions of different pollutants. Because these emissions have no market price, valuing them reliably presents a challenge. For this purpose, we used values from previous relevant studies. We conduct our CBA for the year 2012 and obtain a net present value of $173,331, with an internal rate of return of 6.54 percent.

Using data from our own legal analysis of state MMLs, we evaluate which features are associated with adult and youth recreational and heavy use by linking these policy variables to data from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). We employ differences-in-differences techniques, controlling for state and year fixed effects, allowing us to exploit within-state policy changes. We find that while simple dichotomous indicators of MML laws are not positively associated with marijuana use or abuse, such measures hide the positive influence legal dispensaries have on adult and youth use, particularly heavy use. Sensitivity analyses that help address issues of policy endogeneity and actual implementation of dispensaries support our main conclusion that not all MML laws are the same. Dimensions of these policies, in particular legal protection of dispensaries, can lead to greater recreational marijuana use and abuse among adults and those under the legal age of 21 relative to MMLs without this supply source.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five participants and two key informants. The sample was drawn from a lower-Michigan non-profit organization where participants were seeking foreclosure prevention assistance. Psychological phenomenology focused on the participants' description and shared meaning of their experience. Creswell's (2007) integrated approach was also utilized. A codebook, audit trail, and reflexive statements ensured intercoder reliability and trustworthiness. Participants voiced the importance of sharing their story.

We employ a bivariate realized exponential GARCH (BREG) model with some RCMs to estimate conditional optimal hedge ratios in the Japanese stock and futures markets. The bivariate Student's t-distribution as well as the bivariate normal distribution are used for the return distribution. The out-of-sample results show that the BREG model outperforms the DCC-EGARCH model and the OLS approach using daily returns for a short hedge in the period without unpredictably large fluctuations in returns such as the Lehman aftermath and the economic impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake. The BREG model with a Student's t-distribution is likely to be superior to that with a normal distribution. The use of RCMs with methods reducing bias induced by microstructure noise and non-synchronous trading improves the performance. We also find that the joint model of returns and RCM such as the BREG model yields better performance for a short hedge than a model in which RCM is included as an exogenous variable.

In this paper, we distinguish the underlying motives for tie formation between sets of potential partners in the network, thus informing the relative importance of agency cost and resource accumulation in tie formation across firms. We develop a robust and generalizable methodology that allows for the inference of similarity and/or cumulative advantage motives in the potential presence of resource trading. We estimate the model using venture capital (VC) co-investment networks, employing factor analysis to characterize orthogonal, interpretable resources for VC firms. In the VC setting, value-added resources other than capital appear to be exchanged for capital, but not for one another. We find little evidence for similarity motives as the primary driver of matching, suggesting that concerns over agency conflicts in partnering are dominated by the desire to accumulate higher levels of certain resources.

J,"Jaskowski, M",,,,"Jaskowski, Marcin",,,Should zombie lending always be prevented?,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Zombie lending; Collateral channel; Fire sales,SALES; JAPAN; FIRMS,"It has been argued that zombie lending might have been one of the main culprits behind the sluggish Japanese recovery in the so-called lost decade. Among others, zombie lending may lead to misallocation of capital, reduction of profits for healthy firms, and lower employment. The only remaining question is: Why do banks engage in zombie lending practices? Is it due to wrong incentives for bank managers, or perhaps misguided government policies? Using a simple model, the paper exposes a strong link between collateral value and the strategic importance of zombie lending. The author shows that zombie lending may be an optimal strategy for a bank in some cases as it leads to greater lending ex-ante and prevents further losses from fire sales. Consequently, it can be argued that zombie lending is a side effect of market incompleteness and is ex ante welfare improving, so that it may not be possible or even desirable to prevent its occurrence. Another policy implication is that capital injection into the banks would not solve any problem. However, direct purchase of the collateral on the market would certainly alleviate the problem of zombie lending. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A further examination indicates that boys are likely to have better access to grandparent-provided childcare than girls owing to grandson preference, and this allows parents with a preschool-aged son to work more. The intensification of market work associated with having a son may affect economic outcomes over the lifecycle of parents through labor market attachment. This paper thus sheds light on the important distributional effects of family ties and culture on economic outcomes.","Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, RM 731 HSBC Business Sch Bldg, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",qingwang@phbs.pku.edu.cn,,"Wang, Qing/0000-0003-3997-6767",,,,,25,3,3,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The analyses provide the potential crux regarding the agreements, cooperation and/or conflict among nations for joining the trading. The results show that the polluter pays principle generates the greatest total abatement cost saving for upper-middle and low-middle income nations, but not for others. Full capacity GDRs apply to China, egalitarianism to India and sovereignty to the United States on an individual basis. The results show that the disagreement and gaps with regard to an equitable initial allocation of rights among groups or individual nations is one of the possible obstructions and hindrances to the promotion and formation of a world trading scheme.","[Liou, Je-Liang] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Ctr Green Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Pei-Ing] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Liou, JL (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Ctr Green Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",jlliou@cier.edu.tw; piwu@ntu.edu.tw,"Liou, Je-Liang/S-7525-2019","Liou, Je-Liang/0000-0002-6470-044X; Wu, Pei-Ing/0000-0002-5097-2727",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 98-2410-H-002-056],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Support for this research funded by the Project of NSC 98-2410-H-002-056 from the National Science Council of Taiwan is sincerely appreciated.

Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 to 2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor of four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of one thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spanish livestock is an interesting case because patterns of meat production and consumption have changed dramatically since the 1960s, as Spain has become one of Europe's major meat producers. There were also successive periods of transformation in Spain throughout the historical periods analysed herein, from an extensive to an intensive industrial model as well as from a domestically focused to an internationally oriented sector. In particular, the international context has been crucial in the development of Spanish livestock because of Spain's dependence on imported livestock feed and the increasing relevance of exports, especially to other European countries following Spain's accession to the European Union in 1986.","[Rios-Nunez, Sandra M.] Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Estudios Desarrollo Local & Reg, Cochrane 1056, Osorno, Chile; [Rios-Nunez, Sandra M.] Univ Cordoba, Inst Sociol & Estudios Campesinos, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Coq-Huelva, Daniel] Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Seville, Spain",Universidad de Los Lagos; Universidad de Cordoba; University of Sevilla,"Ríos-Núñez, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Estudios Desarrollo Local & Reg, Cochrane 1056, Osorno, Chile.",sandra.rios@ulagos.cl; dcoq@us.es,,"Coq Huelva, Daniel/0000-0002-1710-4995; Rios Nunez, Sandra/0000-0001-7936-6440",,,,,89,12,12,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

This estimate is derived comparing only households with and without biogas in the same village, thus effectively removing the influence of many potential confounders. Further controls for important determinants of firewood collection, such as household size, per capita consumption expenditure, cattle ownership, unemployment etc. are used to identify the effect of biogas adoption on firewood collection. We derive bounds on omitted variable bias using the proportional selection assumption. Our central estimate is much smaller than those in the previous literature, but is still large enough for the cost of adopting biogas to be heavily subsidized via carbon offsets at a modest carbon price of $10/tCO(2)e, when using central estimates of emission factors and global warming potentials of pollutants taken from the scientific literature.","[Somanathan, E.] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, 7 SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India; [Somanathan, E.] ICIMOD, South Asian Network Dev & Environm Econ, Khumaltar, Nepal; [Bluffstone, Randall] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; Portland State University,"Somanathan, E (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, 7 SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India.",som@isid.ac.in; bluffsto@pdx.edu,,,World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"Financial support for this research was provided by the World Bank.

Focusing on differences between conventional banks and Islamic banks, we examine the effect of (i) Shari'ah supervision boards, (ii) board structure and (iii) CEO-power on performance during the period 2005-2011. We find Shari'ah supervision boards positively impact on Islamic banks' performance when they perform a supervisory role, but the impact is negligible when they have only an advisory role. The effect of board structure (board size and board independence) and CEO power (CEO-chair duality and internally recruited CEO) on the performance of Islamic banks is overall negative. Our findings provide support for the positive contribution of Shari'ah supervision boards but also emphasize the need for enforcement and regulatory mechanism for them to be more effective.

Since it seems unlikely that the typical individual will be indifferent between these various types of perturbation, the idea that there exists a unique willingness to pay-based Value of a Statistical Life Year (VSLY), even for individuals within a given age-group, appears to be ill-founded. This paper examines the issue from a theoretical perspective. Within the context of a simple multi-period model it transpires that if gains in life expectancy are computed on an undiscounted basis then it will indeed be necessary to adjust the magnitude of the VSLY to accommodate the nature of the perturbation in the survival function, as well as the age of those affected. If, by contrast, gains in life expectancy are computed on an appropriately discounted basis then a unique VSLY will be applicable in all cases.","[Jones-Lee, Michael; Chilton, Susan; Metcalf, Hugh; Nielsen, Jytte Seested] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Jones-Lee, M (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",michael.jones-lee@ncl.ac.uk,,"Nielsen, Jytte Seested/0000-0003-0129-0225",,,,,38,13,13,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We find the effects are greatest for sectors and enterprises most reliant on domestic demand which collapsed following the crisis.

In contrast to previous laboratory-based research, we conducted a quasi-experiment in a real life stress situation. Specifically, we used the beauty contest game and compared the performance of a group of participants who were exposed to a real-life stressor (waiting to attend an exam at a university class) with a control group of participants who were not exposed to stress (waiting to attend a regular lecture at a university class). Furthermore, about half of the participants were instructed to write down what they believed another participant had assumed the average number in the beauty contest game to be and which target number she (or he) had chosen accordingly. The results showed that stress impaired strategic reasoning in the beauty contest game. Importantly, even when only including participants who understood the rules of the game in the analyses, stress still increased the numbers chosen in the beauty contest. Furthermore, we found that participants in the stress condition were significantly less likely to base their chosen number on their belief about other players' choices. Hence, stress not only impairs understanding of the math behind the beauty contest game but also the degree of strategizing per se. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates another factor that might determine the effects of globalization on the domestic labor market: the worker's contract type (i.e. permanent vs. temporary contract). We pay particular attention to wages and examine whether the contract type influences the impact of offshoring. Individual-level wage data from the Korean Labor & Income Panel Study during 1999-2007, linked to industry-level offshoring data from the World Input-Output Database are used to answer this question. Even after controlling for individual worker and employer characteristics, industry, and occupation, we find that South Korean manufacturing workers' wages increase as offshoring increases, but this impact is significantly weaker for temporary workers. Thus, our findings support public concern that globalization exacerbates inequality and shows that one potential channel of growing inequality is the contract type.","[Lee, Hongshik] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lee, Joonhyung] Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Korea University; University of Memphis,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",honglee@korea.ac.kr; jlee17@memphis.edu,,"Lee, Hongshik/0000-0002-7189-2494; Lee, Joonhyung/0000-0002-6924-6012",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2054749],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea Grant, funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2054749).

PEP is supposed to deliver automatic accommodation to terms-of-trade shocks, while retaining the credibility gain from a nominal anchor. This paper analyzes the PEP proposal in a dynamic general-equilibrium model and compares it with a standard Taylor rule, consumer price index (CPI)-level targeting and a nominal exchange rate peg. Judged by the degree of output stabilization, PEP performs very similar to CPI targeting for export demand as well as domestic demand shocks and underperforms in the case of shocks to the export price. The results suggest that PEP is not superior to conventional CPI targeting from a macroeconomic stabilization perspective.","[Vogel, Lukas] Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Hohberger, Stefan; Herz, Bernhard] Univ Bayreuth, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Vogel, L (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, CHAR 14-233, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",lukas.vogel@ec.europa.eu,"Hohberger, Stefan/T-9141-2019","Hohberger, Stefan/0000-0001-8399-2241; Vogel, Lukas/0000-0002-8106-2750",,,,,19,2,2,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

(2010) to European stock markets. Like in the United States, European value-growth returns are strongly dependent on the valuation signals contained in the firm's equity financing activities. The high returns of value firms are due to value purchasers, while the low returns of growth firms are due to growth issuers. Among value issuers and growth purchasers, there exists no value premium at all. The large return difference between value purchasers and growth issuers cannot be explained by common risk factors. However, employing Piotroski and So's (2012) recently proposed market expectation errors approach shows that the observed value-growth returns can be attributed to mispricing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Low prior turnover firms also experience larger positive long-run excess returns following announcements.

Economists appear to have a good case for support to non-governmental alternatives as suppliers of schooling. However, unlike other policy domains, freer international trade or privatisation, economists have been remarkably unsuccessful in promoting the adoption of this idea. We develop a general positive model of why governments typically produce schooling which introduces the key notion of the lack of verifiability of socialisation and instruction of beliefs, which makes third party contracting for socialisation problematic. We use the model to explain variations around the world in levels of private schooling. We also predict the circumstances in which efforts to promote the different alternatives to government production - like charter, voucher, and scholarship - are likely to be successful.","[Pritchett, Lant] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Viarengo, Martina] Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland; [Viarengo, Martina] Harvard Univ, Ctr Int Dev, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland",Harvard University,"Viarengo, M (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland.",martina.viarengo@graduateinstitute.ch,,,British Academy; Royal Society,British Academy; Royal Society(Royal Society),"We would like to thank, without implication, Michael Clemens, Deon Filmer, Richard B.

When the jackpots exceed 500 million Taiwan dollars, the trading volume decreases between 5.2% and 9.1% among stocks preferred by individual investors and between 6.8% and 8.6% among lottery-like stocks. The decline in individual buy volume is statistically indistinct from the decline in sell volume.

The opponents of these laws have long argued that these laws may harm the restaurant industry by repelling customers who smoke on a regular basis. In this paper, using data from the confidential version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we estimate the impact of restaurant smoking bans on dining out expenditures of smoking and nonsmoking households. We identify the impact of these bans by exploiting the substantial variation in the implementation of these bans across different cities, counties, and states. Our results indicate that although restaurant smoking bans are associated with a 15.1% decrease in dining out expenditures of smoking households, they increase the dining out expenditures of nonsmoking households by 8.6%. Since the majority of the U.S. population does not smoke, the aggregate impact of restaurant smoking bans on dining out expenditures is slightly positive but statistically insignificant. These results imply that restaurant smoking bans do not harm the restaurant industry. (C) d2015 Elsevier Inc.

Since the returns are heteroskedastic, a little consideration was given to volatility structural breaks and diverse states. In this study, we conduct extensive simulations to prove that the switching regime GARCH model, under the highly flexible skewed generalized t (SGT) distribution, is remarkably efficient in detecting different volatility states. Next, we examine the switching regime in the S&P 500 volatility for weekly, daily, 10-minute and 1-minute returns. Results show that the volatility switches regimes frequently, and differences between the distributions of the high and low volatility states become more accentuated as the frequency increases. Moreover, the SGT is highly preferable to the usually employed skewed t distribution. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The scanned subject has the option to 'play', in which case both receive outcomes according to their moves, or 'opt-out' and receive the same sure amount along with the 'opponent' outside the scanner for whom half the trials are relegated to a die. Having an 'opt-out' option enables us to estimate subjects' certainty equivalent under four types of uncertainties-game (matching pennies versus coordination) x play (strategic versus random). Our observation of subjects valuing playing coordination more than matching pennies supports a preference for shared plight in the income inequality literature. This preference is modulated by whether subjects face conscious or random play. Specifically, in matching pennies, subjects require a premium to play when the opponent makes a conscious move compared with a random move. Yet, they are willing to accept a discount to play coordination strategically rather than randomly. In accounting for the observed differential risk preferences, our brain imaging results distinguish an explanation drawn from source preference, which is self-regarding, from one based on social preference under uncertainty, which is other-regarding. We observe that activations in the amygdala and the orbital prefrontal cortex are modulated by the game x play interaction, extending previous finding of their association with decision making under ambiguity. Finally we employ a source-dependent expected utility model to analyze the behavioral and imaging data and find that the value of playing the various games is encoded in the striatum.","[Chark, Robin] Univ Macau, Asia Pacific Acad Econ & Management, Macau, Peoples R China; [Chew, Soo Hong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Chew, Soo Hong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Finance, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Chew, Soo Hong] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Macau; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Chew, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link,AS2 06-02, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",chew.soohong@gmail.com,,"Chew, Soo Hong/0000-0003-1245-0909","HKUST; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong","HKUST; Research Grants Council, Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","We have received helpful comments from Ming Hsu, Jungang Qin, Songfa Zhong, Kirsten Rohde, the editor and an anonymous reviewer.

Combining theories of time-spatial organisation and mobility, we critically investigate the implications of transforming traditional stationary preschool practice into a mobile preschool. Our findings show that the social order of the mobile preschool is 'being on the move' and that the travelling shapes the time-spatial organisation, with major implications for daily routines and activities. In our analyses we show how constant travelling characterises the mobile preschool as a social practice with (i) logistics and choice of place prevailing over daily planning, (ii) creation of time and space for embodied habits, (iii) teachers as attendants and children as passengers, and (iv) walking in lines. However, mobility and time-spatial constraints are also co-constructed and intimately connected with the participants' agency, since both children and teachers are actively 'doing time' and 'creating space' within the dominant structure of 'being on the move'.

However, SEOs are disproportionately conducted by Capital Purchase Program (CPP) recipients, and this is not explained by CPP recipients' economic and regulatory capital needs. SEOs in 2009 and 2010 by CPP recipients alone account for 27% by number, and 50% by dollar amount, of all SEOs by U.S. banks between 1994 and 2010, indicating the CPP is an influential event in the history of U.S. bank SEOs during this period. Controlling for economic and regulatory capital determinants of SEOs, CPP recipients were more likely than non-recipients to have a SEO within four quarters subsequent to CPP receipt. SEO proceeds were used to repay CPP receipts without jeopardizing loan growth. Banks that received CPP funds prior to the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and banks with greater reliance on non-traditional banking activities, were more likely to have a SEO expeditiously and repay CPP funds early. Collectively, the results provide new evidence on the realized consequences of the CPP for bank SEOs. Tests suggest the CPP's indirect costs of restrictions on corporate policies and actions as the most likely explanation for the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper studies the role of structural transformation in accounting for the aggregate productivity growth gap between two economies. We calibrate a neoclassical model of structural transformation for China and India. The model implies that higher productivity growth in China's manufacturing and agriculture accounts for most of the aggregate productivity growth gap between the two countries. According to the development strategy of China's government, China would start a new phase of structural transformation whereby employment is moving from manufacturing to services. Since the productivity growth gap in services is pretty small between China and India, if China wants to remain superior in relative productivity, it should improve the productivity growth rate of services. In contrast, the relative performance in India hinges on closing its productivity gap in agriculture and manufacturing relative to China.","[Liu, Hehe; Yang, Tianyu] Renmin Univ China, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Yang, TY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, 59 ZhongGuanCun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",ytianyu@sina.com,,,MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [13JJD790036],MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,"The authors wish to thank the editors and two referees for their useful comments, as well as Barry Bosworth and Susan M.

We present a simple model featuring such effects and show that efficiency may be improved if political parties interfere with the nominations.

This paper puts forward the hypothesis that the decline in the risk premium on Britain's sovereign debt was due to the significant increase in excise duties in the early part of the eighteenth century. This increase was possible for two reasons. On the one hand, with the Glorious Revolution, parliament no longer had reason to fear that the King would strengthen his political power due to the availability of more fiscal revenue. On the other hand, the new excise taxes were borne mostly by the poor, that is a social class not represented in parliament. The delay in reducing the interest rate on British sovereign debt, following the Glorious Revolution, was, therefore, due to the length of time needed to increase and improve the fiscal bureaucracy responsible for the collection of excise duties.

The authors aim to investigate, using a questionnaire survey among the customers of Cluj-Napoca shopping centers, the relationship among the components of image and satisfaction and the various types of loyalty. The conclusions of the structural equations modelling reveal that most components of the image (assortment, price, loyalty policy, decor, service and communication) directly and positively influence satisfaction, and that satisfaction and conative loyalty mediate the relationship between image and behavioural loyalty. The results reveal important managerial implications from the point of view of innovative actions of shopping centers, which can contribute to attracting and keeping customers, these contributing not only to creating loyal patrons, but also to increasing their competitiveness and to achieving better positioning.","[Abrudan, Ioana-Nicoleta; Plaias, Ioan; Dabija, Dan-Cristian] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Abrudan, IN (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ioana.abrudan@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Abrudan, Ioana/CAH-5314-2022","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X;",,,,,75,5,5,0,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,536,552,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900003,0

The 'commitment' and high 'speed' of share repurchases in ASRs appear to give ASR firms stronger incentive to deflate the pre-repurchase earnings than open market repurchase (OMR) firms, in order to reduce repurchase costs. However, in contrast to the OMRs of Gong, Louis, and Sun (2008), we do not find such earnings management for ASR firms.

Using the same data construction and specification methodologies, we find that the effect has shrunk to 3.2 by 2007; namely, the border effect in 2007 reduces state-province trade by two-thirds. Thus, between 1993 and 2007, the border effect declined by 22 %.

Sectorial constant elasticity of substitution (CES) cost functions and Shephard's lemma provide the explicit relative commodity price functions and the sectorial cost shares and capital-labor ratios.

Spatial econometrics or spatial fixed effects have become popular ways of addressing these concerns. We discuss the limitations of standard spatial approaches to hedonic modeling and demonstrate the spatial generalized additive model as an alternative.

Nevertheless, sequential rather than simultaneous adoption of these two types of innovation may be optimal. In this paper, we analyze the pattern of mutual causation of technological and organizational innovations and contribute to the understanding of their inter-dependencies. By the means of a test of necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of sequential versus simultaneous complementarity, we explore the adoption of two allegedly complementary innovations in the sphere of design, namely, computer-aided design/manufacture equipment (CAD) and inter-organizational design teams with customers and suppliers (JOD). The evidence is drowned upon a longitudinal sample of Italian manufacturing plants observed over 27 years (1970-1996). We find that simultaneous adoption of the two innovations under consideration is unlikely while the likelihood of JOD adoption increases having adopted CAD. The results highlight the driving role of technological innovations, and notably of the decline in the price of IT equipment, upon the diffusion of complementary organizational innovations.","[Battisti, Giuliana] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Colombo, Massimo G.] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Rabbiosi, Larissa] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Warwick; Polytechnic University of Milan; Copenhagen Business School,"Rabbiosi, L (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Porcelaenshaven 24A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",Giuliana.Battisti@wbs.ac.uk; massimo.colombo@polimi.it; lr.int@cbs.dk,,"Colombo, Massimo G./0000-0003-0373-1565",PRIN National Research Programme [B41J12000160008],PRIN National Research Programme,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the PRIN National Research Programme, grant project number B41J12000160008.",,64,11,14,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The alternative chronology detects 90% of the peaks and troughs identified by the NBER and Romer (1994), but the new dates are consistently dated earlier for more than 50% of them, especially as regards the NBER troughs. The new dates affect the comparison of the average duration of recessions and expansions in both pre-WWI and interwar eras. Whereas the NBER reference dates show an increase in average duration of the expansions between the pre-WWI and interwar periods, the new dates show evidence of shortened length of expansions.

We assess how the concentration of credit relationships and the position of a bank in the network topology of the system influence the bank's ability to meet liquidity demand. We use quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposure among all German banks from 2000 to 2008 to measure interbank relationships and network characteristics. We match these data with bids placed by individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank's willingness to pay for liquidity, since they had variable rate tenders with a pay-your-bid price. Controlling for bank characteristics and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a lower price for liquidity in the ECB's main refinancing operations. These findings suggest that incentives to diversify banks' liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information. When the network position of the bank is taken into account, we find that central lenders in the money market bid more aggressively in auctions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We formalize and extend the original argument laid out by Buchanan and Tullock (The calculus of consent: logical foundations of constitutional democracy, 1962) using a decision theoretic analysis from the perspective of an individual voter. Unlike previous formalizations, voters in our study are members of one or more groups. This allows us to examine cases wherein different voters have starkly different interests. Furthermore, voters in our study can err in their judgments of proposals allowing us to model potential irrationalities in the choice of an optimal k-majority rule. We consider both up or down votes on a single proposal as well as votes over a series of proposals. We find that the optimal k-majority rule depends on a number of parameters, most notably the number of rounds needed to create a proposal that will pass. Group membership has almost no affect. Furthermore, if two groups are at odds, then the external cost function can actually rise over some range of ; if voters err systematically in their judgment, more inclusive k-majority rules, such as unanimity rule, can fail to pass Pareto preferred proposals.

Using data from 43 countries from 1993 to 2009, we find that firms with high trade credit located in producer countries have stock returns that are strongly predictable based on the returns of their associated customer countries. This behavior is especially prevalent among firms with high levels of foreign sales. To better understand this effect we develop an asset pricing model in which firms in different countries are connected by trade credit links. The model offers further predictions about this phenomenon, including stronger predictability during periods of high credit constraints and low uninformed trading volume.

In addition, ELO find the metric useful in predicting short-term volatility. VPIN involves decomposing volume into active buys and sells. We utilize quotes and trade data to construct an accurate trade classification measure for E-mini S&P 500 futures. Against this benchmark, the ELO Bulk Volume Classification (BVC) scheme is inferior to a standard tick rule. Moreover, VPIN predicts volatility solely because increasing volatility induces systematic classification errors in the BVC procedure.

We deal with nonparametric estimation of the pricing kernel (PK) given by the ratio of the risk-neutral density estimator and the historical density (HD). The former density can be represented as the second derivative w.r.t. the European call option price function, which we estimate by nonparametric regression. HD is estimated nonparametrically too. In this framework, we develop the asymptotic distribution theory of the Empirical Pricing Kernel (EPK) in the L-infinity sense. Particularly, to evaluate the overall variation of the pricing kernel, we develop a uniform confidence band of the EPK. Furthermore, as an alternative to the asymptotic approach, we propose a bootstrap confidence band. The developed theory is helpful for testing parametric specifications of pricing kernels and has a direct extension to estimating risk aversion patterns. The established results are assessed and compared in a Monte-Carlo study. As a real application, we test risk aversion over time induced by the EPK.","[Haerdle, Wolfgang Karl] Humboldt Univ, CASE, Berlin, Germany; [Okhrin, Yarema] Univ Augsburg, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Wang, Weining] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Augsburg; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Okhrin, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Dept Stat, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",yarema.okhrin@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Okhrin, Yarema/AAF-5305-2019; Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013","Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin [SFB 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin,"The financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via SFB 649 Okonomisches Risiko, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin is gratefully acknowledged.

The aim of the paper is to specify the company behaviour that leads to innovative outputs with high level of novelty in country specific context of Slovakia. We conducted two-stage empirical research in 2009 and 2014 mapping companies' approach to innovation management during the last 10 years. After surveying 102 firms in the first stage and 287 firms in the second stage we derive success factors for radical innovations. The findings demonstrate growing importance of corporate strategic orientation, highly developed innovation processes and parallel mechanisms for radical innovation, ability to manage internally and externally open innovation and support entrepreneurial culture. This study makes unique contribution to the understanding of innovation processes, organizational factors, and their significance and dynamics. It should attract managerial attention to recognize the importance of innovation management factors for building firm's innovation competency.","Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Knosková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",lubica.knoskova@euba.sk,,,"Ministry of education, science, research and sport of Slovak Republic [017EU-4/2013]","Ministry of education, science, research and sport of Slovak Republic","The paper is output of the research project KEGA no. 017EU-4/2013 Youth education in secondary vocational schools focused on innovation and creating new business opportunities granted by Ministry of education, science, research and sport of Slovak Republic.",,32,13,15,7,98,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,342,357,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800022,0

Estimates from our model suggest that actuarially fair risk-based deposit insurance that considers only individual bank failure risk is underpriced, leaving insurance providers exposed to net losses. Our estimates also capture the size premium where big banks are priced with higher deposit insurance than small banks. This result is particularly relevant to the current regulatory concerns on big banks that are too-big-to-fail. Above all, our approach provides a unifying framework for integrating risk-based deposit insurance with risk-based Basel capital requirements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Today, this image is based on a number of researches and studies conducted by specialized government bodies and private organizations and research institutes that show that these products offer, in terms of their nutritional profile, a high intake of nutrients with positive impact on health. Consumers also know that operators who produce and sell such products are subject to rigorous regulations for obtaining the organic certificate and the right to use the organic logo and are regularly monitored by inspection and certification bodies in this regard - facts that increase the new generation of consumers' confidence in the quality and safety of these products. Having the aim of highlighting the decisive factors which contribute to the creation of a positive image for the ecological foodstuff among consumers and in order to understand the real motivations of the decisional process of buying these products, an exploring marketing research was realized among the new generation of consumers. Another aim of the investigation is the identification of some problems connected with a possible unbalanced nutritional profile of some ecological products commercialized in Romania and whose consumption may be inadequate for a diet and, implicitly, for some consumers' health, especially for those having certain food restrictions caused by nutritional diseases from which they suffer. In this regard, we are going to analyse, from a scientific point of view, the nutritional profile of some ecological foodstuff found on the market in Romania, using an accredited and standardized method within the European Union-the SAIN-LIM method. Thereby, the paper aims to highlight the antithesis between the formal positive consumer perception and the nutritional profile of some organic products on the Romanian market. Through this endeavour we intend to draw attention on the need of adopting a good practices guideline in education and consumer information in order to acquire the skills for a more correct buying decision. We believe that these good practices should be included among the pursuits of the education system, government structures and specialized NGOs.","[Voinea, Lelia; Popescu, Dorin Vicentiu; Negrea, Mihai Teodor] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Negrea, MT (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",teodor.negrea@com.ase.ro,"Negrea, Teodor Mihai/JMQ-7223-2023; Voinea, Lelia/AAD-5088-2019; Popescu, Dorin-Vicentiu/JND-9438-2023","Negrea, Teodor Mihai/0000-0001-8546-272X; Voinea, Lelia/0000-0002-6164-426X; Popescu, Dorin-Vicentiu/0000-0002-9172-1289",,,,,29,17,18,1,37,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,488,506,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800031,0

However, predicting the overall impact of FDI on wage inequality is complex depending on country specific effects, namely how large are differences in skilled and unskilled wages and the skill intensity of employment in foreign-owned firms compared to domestic ones, as well as the relative size of employment in domestic and foreign-owned firms (Zulfiu-Alili, 2014). Hence, the effect of foreign ownership on relative wages and skill intensity will vary between sectors, across countries and over time. The effect of FDI on the skill intensity of employment in transition economies is analysed using the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) undertaken in three waves 2002, 2005 and 2009. The question to be addressed is whether foreign-owned firms employ a more educated and skilled workforce in comparison to domestic-owned firms.

We point out the twin nature of the financial crises in Europe in comparison with the US crises: in addition to the role of bank funding, the euro area countries have also experienced a structural problem of balance of payment disequilibria. This explains why in the early stages of the subprime crisis, the Fed has succeeded in tackling the illiquidity problems facing the banking sector, while the ECB did not. The Fed could then focus on tackling the recession in the real sector by adopting quantitative easing policies to exert downward pressure on the long-term interest-rate. In the euro area quantitative easing policies came later, in 2013. Even the forward guidance policies have been different between the two central banks. Unlike the ECB, the Fed has gone through diverse forward guidance policies: qualitative, calendar-based, and state-contingent. The chapter proposes a new survey of the monetary policies after the subprime crisis by comparing two strategies in different contexts: the United States and the euro area.","[Aloy, Marcel; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France; [Aloy, Marcel; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Sch Econ GREQAM, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France; [Aloy, Marcel; Dufrenot, Gilles] CNRS, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France; [Aloy, Marcel] EHESS, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles] Banque France, EHESS, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Aloy, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Route Milles, F-13290 Aix En Provence Les Mill, France.",marcel.aloy@univ-amu.fr; gilles.dufrenot@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,419,449,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024024,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900013,0

One of the prerequisites for the functioning of the territorial self-government is the ownership of property and the ability to manage it. The paper is therefore devoted to analyzing the state of property at the higher territorial self-government units in the Czech Republic (regions), with the exception of the capital, Prague. In short, the ownership of property is justified by the territorial self-government, the legislative entrenchment of ownership and types of property. Subsequently, in several tables and graphs the assets of the self-governing regions are compared according to the balance sheets at the end of 2013. From the conducted analysis of the state of property follows that the amount of the assets and the structure in each region is different in terms of the total volume as well as in comparison with per capita in the region.

The previous study, Model Proposal for Investigating and Increasing the Social Security Administration's Premium Collection Revenue analysed the relationship between the premium revenue and premium rate/load for all the employees and make a total analyse for premium rate and revenue. In this study it will be focused on : Individuals working on service contract who are subject to SSK(Social Insurance Administration) before the reform. The monthly data for the period between October 2008 and December 2012 were used in the study. The results of the analysis revealed a significantly parabolic relationship between the Administration's premium revenues and insurance premium load, which is similar to the Laffer curve. The insurance premium rate that would maximize the Administration's premium revenues was found to be 36.9% and it was determined that an improvement amount of 6.8 billion TL would have been obtained for the premium revenues in 2012 if this rate had been applied. In fact the explanatory power of this study (% 96) is more than the explanatory power of previous study (% 80) because the ex-study consisted of the public employees and trades people whose elasticity is lower against the social security premium rate.

The paper attempts to establish a frank and open picture of the state of the game, with right balance between theory and authentic professional experience of author. It assesses key Slovak strengths and weaknesses, identifies opportunities and offers a food for thought.","[Bohac, Radomir] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Bohác, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",radomir.bohac@mzv.sk,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,58,67,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500007,0

An input oriented variable returns to scale frontier identified twelve efficient firms, and nine more that are technically efficient but not scale efficient. The top third's overall efficiency score was 0.999. For the bottom third, the average efficiency score was just 0.346, which indicates that there is substantial room for improvement among bottom third producers in this production system. Overall, efficiency was correlated with stocking density, flock size, unit production cost and profitability, cumulative family experience of farming and the use of family labour, but not with farm size, breed choice or any proxy for individual experience or ability. Predation rates in particular were uncorrelated with productivity scores and reproductive performance was only weakly correlated with it. While most farms could theoretically improve their efficiency by intensifying their operations, a closer analysis of best practice firms revealed a spectrum of optimal intensities, including the possibility of restoring rangelands by deliberate understocking. Grazing strategy and the degree of labour self-sufficiency emerged as the key determinants of optimal intensity.","[Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University,"Conradie, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",beatrice.conradie@uct.ac.za; j.piesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300","Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries [20638, 18919]",Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Agriculture and Water Resources),This research was funded by the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (contracts 20638 and 18919).

While such models pose difficulties for estimation and analysis, CJO propose an innovative approach to filtering intended to addresses them. However, some statistical issues arise that their approach leaves unresolved, with implications for the option pricing results. This note proposes a solution based on using the filter and estimator proposed by CJO but interpreted in the context of an alternative model. With respect to this model, the estimator is consistent, and likelihood-based model comparisons and hypothesis tests are valid. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While some countries apply mainly private sector financing, others employ higher education systems which are financed by public sectors. The contribution of public sector to higher education financing varies significantly in each country. There have been important developments in higher education systems in many countries recently. As a result of developments in this area, the balance between the contribution levels of private and public sectors to higher education financing has changed. The current study discusses the different applications of higher education financing systems and analyzes the contribution of different actors participating in higher education financing. Higher education financing systems in different countries are examined. The first part of this study focuses on the theoretical framework of higher education services, and the second part provides a comparison of the shares of the actors who contribute to higher education financing in the countries in question.

The key factors for these high-tech start-ups were derived, including decision-making efficiency of the entrepreneurial team, the rationality and efficiency of space-time opportunities in the market, the construction of entrepreneurial team, the legal provisions for relevant high-tech products, the technical innovation and security, and financial guarantee.

We find a consistent result in the short-and long-run price discovery process. Our results show that the Nikkei 225 index futures price is influenced mainly by information from the location of trading rather than from the home market, supporting the trading-place-bias hypothesis.

Probe into several organizations in the Hradec Kralove region proved low engagement. The case study results were almost identical with very sophisticated results of the Gallup company. Into the communication with an internal customer less effort is invested compared to the communication with an external customer. Managers are failing due to insufficient communication at the workplace and unsatisfying understanding of their impact on the company culture and productivity of its employees.","[Kasparova, Bohdana; Bouckova, Zuzana; Maresova, Petra; Kuca, Kamil] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Kasparová, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",bohdana.kasparova@uhk.cz; zuzana.bouckova@uhk.cz; petra.maresova@uhk.cz; kamil.kuca@uhk.cz,"Kuca, Kamil/D-1396-2011; Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Kuca, Kamil/0000-0001-9664-1109;",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-546-2,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,Pt 1,,,,401,407,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM2SF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000461417100055,0

To investigate the influence of pollution on population health a mathematical model was designed based on statistical information on the morbidity of various groups of the population of different cities in the Irkutsk region, characterized by intense environmental and sanitary situation. In order to identify the pollution damage to health we estimated economic losses from the increase in the population morbidity in the Irkutsk region (Russia). We supposed that compensation for living in a polluted region should be affected through tax regulation, by compensating through personal taxes, first, personal income tax. This deduction should at least minimally compensate health damage (for example, at least it should be enough to purchase vitamins). Scale of environmental deduction can be differentiated depending on the contamination of the territory, based on the zoning of the Russian Federation subjects in terms of emissions of air pollutants. Thus, income tax paid by resident population on polluted territories would be lower, and aggregate disposable income higher. This would make possible at least partial compensation for detriment to public health caused by living on polluted territories.","[Kireenko, Anna P.] Baikal State Univ Econ & Law, Chair Tax & Taxat, Lenina Str 11, Irkutsk, Russia; [Gorbunova, Olga I.] Baikal State Univ Econ & Law, Chair Econ & Business Adm, Irkutsk, Russia; [Burmenko, Tatiana A.] Baikal State Univ Econ & Law, Chair Management Mkt & Serv, Irkutsk, Russia",Baikal State University; Baikal State University; Baikal State University,"Kireenko, AP (通讯作者)，Baikal State Univ Econ & Law, Chair Tax & Taxat, Lenina Str 11, Irkutsk, Russia.",kireenko-ap@isea.ru; olga1968111@rambler.ru; burmenko.tatiana@yandex.ru,"Gorbunova, Olga/ABI-1998-2020; Burmenko, Tatiana/AAH-8556-2019; Kireenko, Anna/C-3219-2017","Kireenko, Anna/0000-0002-7860-5929",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,106,112,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500018,0

Application of these principles can undoubtedly have various influences on an economy. Empirical analyses are desirable, but there is a problem of suitable quantitative approximation of such issues.

The second part introduces a way of measuring the transparency in public administration: for this purpose the Corruption Perception Index - CPI 2013 is used.

The empirical results suggest that: (1) the Birge-Massart threshold method can make a good job for revising the impact from the price limit mechanism, and the price limit mechanism exaggerates the reaction of the futures market to the shock of the spot market and vice versa; (2) nonsynchronous trading problems caused by the price limit mechanism weaken the relationship between the CSI300 futures market and spot market.

GIS is the primary visualization tool in this regard, but most current methods are based on scalar objects that lack directionality and rate of change - key attributes of travel. The few studies that do consider field-based time geography have largely looked at vector fields for individuals, not populations. A population-based vector field is proposed for visualizing time-geographic demand momentum. The field is estimated using a vector kernel density generated from observed trajectories of a sample population. By representing transport systems as vector fields that share the same time-space domain, demand can be projected onto the systems to visualize relationships between them. This visualization tool offers a powerful approach to visually correlate changes in the systems with changes in demand, as demonstrated in a case study of the Greater Toronto Area using data from the 2006 and 2011 Transportation Tomorrow Surveys. As a result, it is now possible to measure in real time the effects of disasters on the economic welfare of a population, or quantify the effects of operational strategies and designs on the behavioural activity patterns of the population.

However, the Fed's policy since 2008 of reducing the opportunity cost of excess reserves to zero (or even negative) has neutralized the stimulative effect of the Fed's low interest rate policy. Eliminating interest on excess reserves would restore the effectiveness of monetary policy, but would require promptly unwinding the Fed's Quantatitve Easing acquisitions. It is argued that the Fed's reaction function should contain no pure inertial terms, and that the output gap as originally conceived by Taylor is a statistical illusion.

In order to explain the inter-individual differences, we examine the relation between decision for (or against) managerial position under ethically different conditions and the underlying psychological processes as measured by the HEXACO personality inventory. HEXACO model distinguishes 6 personality dimensions: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience; each dimension is composed of four sub-dimensions (facets). In our study, we take into account four facets of the Honesty-Humility scale, because this scale attempts to measure the ethical dimension of personality. Sample and methods: In our study, 157 undergraduate students of business filled the questionnaire containing HEXACO-60 items and responded further questions dealing with their managerial decisions under ethical constraints. Structural Equation Modelling was used to link the relevant personality traits and decision-making. Results: Four facets of Honesty-Humility Scale are arranged into two latent variables (Relationship towards Material Values and Relationship towards Other People). These latent variables significantly predict managerial decisions both in ethically neutral as well as in ethically problematic situation.","[Mentel, Andrej] Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Social Anthropol, Mlynske Luhy 4, Bratislava 82105, Slovakia; [Ziaran, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Comenius University Bratislava; Mendel University in Brno,"Mentel, A (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Social Anthropol, Mlynske Luhy 4, Bratislava 82105, Slovakia.",andrej.mentel@fses.uniba.sk; pavel.ziaran@mendelu.cz,"Mentel, Andrej/AAG-6260-2019; Žiaran, Pavel/U-5083-2017; Mentel, Andrej/HDO-0564-2022","Mentel, Andrej/0000-0002-8556-7625; Mentel, Andrej/0000-0002-8556-7625",,,,,19,0,0,1,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,552,558,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000061,0

The proposed improvements in the methodology of estimation and interpretation of CES production function parameters are applied in case of Romania during the period (1960-1979).

It seeks to understand the drivers of CA adoption intensity in terms of the number of practices implemented using count data analysis. On average, the farmers in our sample adopt five out of eight possible CA practices while only 7.4% use all eight practices in any one year. Practices such as digging planting basins (81.9%), applying manure (73.2%) and timely post-planting weeding (70.1%) are relatively popular, while adoption of crop rotation (22.8%) is comparatively rare. Productivity is positively correlated to the number of techniques used. Farmers adopting all the CA practices are the most productive, with an estimated maize yield of 2.50 tons/ha, compared with a yield of less than 1 tons/ha for those using three techniques or fewer. Results from a Poisson regression indicate that education, agro-ecology, non-governmental input support and extension support have a significant impact on adoption intensity. Subsidised inputs increase the number of components used, although access to those inputs was uneven across regions of Zimbabwe. Further, the number of CA components used in the previous season positively impacts current season adoption intensity, implying that promotions of CA technologies do have a persistent effect, even after those promotions end.","[Pedzisa, Tarisayi] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Rugube, Lovemore] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Winter-Nelson, Alex] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Baylis, Kathy] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mazvimavi, Kizito] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Pedzisa, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",tpedzisa@yahoo.com; loverugube@yahoo.com; alexwn@illinois.edu; baylis@illinois.edu; k.mazvimavi@cgiar.org,,,,,,,47,26,32,0,17,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2015,54.0,3,,,,,1,22,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1084939,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DA5MZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367848500001,0

Firstly, we identify the key factors influencing entrepreneurial activity of seniors on European level, based on literature review and our previous studies. At the same time we apply senior entrepreneurship inclusivity index to measure the level of senior entrepreneurial inclusiveness in each European country on a national level. Using the results of these analyses we thereafter implement cluster analysis method to create clusters among European countries based on the similarities in the relationship between the levels senior entrepreneurial activity and entrepreneurial activity of general population. Based on that, we identify countries with above the average levels of senior entrepreneurship inclusivity. These results serve us to assess key similarities in clustered countries in terms of entrepreneurial culture and policies that have major influence on success factors and senior entrepreneurship itself.","[Pilkova, Anna; Rehak, Jan] Comenius Univ, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Pilková, A (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",anna.pilkova@fm.uniba.sk; jan.rehak@fm.uniba.sk,"Rehak, Jan/HRD-7249-2023; Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019","Rehak, Jan/0000-0002-5075-1908;",,,,,29,2,2,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,685,695,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000075,0

One of the answers to this challenge is the creation and distribution of network organizations. Networks are a form of integration of independent business units. Economic motives for the formation of the network are to improve the efficiency of resource use members of the network and gaining access to the resources of the other participants of the network. Feature of the interaction within network is that members of the network are connected not only relations of cooperation, but also competition. This makes the network potentially unsustainable. There is a high risk of decay of network. Rid of it requires the use of special methods of management. They should take into account the specifics of networks as management objects. The study shows that the performance of the network will grow, if on the basis of the consent of all the participants in it will create a single focal point. The main objective of this center is to coordinate the actions of the participants and the formation of the optimal composition of the network. In the network management is recommended, in addition to formal contracts, to take into account the informal rules of network availability. To increase their effectiveness suggest measures for their gradual formalization. It is recommended, in particular, to develop and to fix the agreement between members of the network distribution mechanism between benefits, costs and risks. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The panel bootstrap Granger causality test applied allows us to control for both the presence of cross-country heterogeneity and doss-sectional dependence. Our results barely provide evidence against the null hypothesis according to which government debt does not cause real GDP growth. More interestingly, we find evidence against the absence of causality from non-financial private debt - especially that of households - to growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Along with the changing economic paradigm, the political and economic uncertainty brings about an increased demand for corporate leaders with visions and authority. Methodology/methods: the paper is based on comparative analysis and definitions of the state-of-the-art theories of leadership such as transformational, and spiritual. The analysis is followed by the historic case study of a successful model. This historical comparison is of importance for creating and developing present theories. Scientific aim: The paper aims to present the historical views on leadership in management, and the modern theories of leadership in the corporate strategic management. Next, it compares the present views with the successful management proven by previous experience pointing out the common signs. A telling example is brought of a historic Czech industrial enterprise and its undisputable leader. Findings: The economic recession of the last decade has stressed the importance of leadership as a significant part of the corporate strategic management. Viewed from a distance of several years, this topic should be reconsidered and the situation analysed from different angles. This paper offers the managerial aspect and that of the strategic management in particular. Among others, this is motivated by an effort to find effective models of management that could help avoid economic fluctuations and subsequent political disturbances in the future. Conclusions: The paper's contribution will consist of a clear analytic material showing the development of the views on leadership and a comparison with a proven successful strategy. Thus conceived, the study may pave the way for enhancing the present theory. It is a contribution to the theoretical level of leadership while also providing a best-practice example.

Moreover, investor protection is significantly increased if the selection decision regarding a certain investment firm is based on a rigorous analysis of the bankruptcy risk. On other hand, the capital market supervision authority (Financial Supervison Authority) would show great interest in results obtained from bankruptcy risk assessment models, for the purpose of ensuring market integrity. This paper aims to test and analyze the results determined under two classical models used for assessing the risk of bankruptcy (Altman and Conan-Holder). We investigated a sample of more than 20 Romanian investment firms, summing a total market share of around 40% at the end of 2014. Main results show a pesimistic view in terms of the capacity to sustain financial soundness imposed in terms of prudential supervision under MiFID requirements.

The investigation is based on the enterprises' simplified annual financial reports. In the economic environment of our days, the principle of no risk means no profit is widely accepted and supported. It can also he added, if there is no profit, there is no successful growth. By using leverage ratios, below we intend to analyze two basic types of enterprise risk: financial risk and operational risk. Several publications dealing with enterprise growth are available, yet none have yet been able to offer a common approach to this problem. In our publication enterprise growth is considered as the effective growth of certain economic indicators. We investigate internal and sustainable growth rates in the period of 2010-2013 in a sample of enterprises registered in County Bihor and operating in different sectors of economy. In the second part of the study, the investigated firms are grouped by calculated indicators based on their 2012 year's results by the method of cluster analysis. The calculations were carried out by the R statistics program which is used in a variety of research fields and has the advantage of being an open source software system. The program can offer the modules that are required for our analysis. For our cluster analysis we applied module 'hclust'. The results of the analysis show that there are no significant changes in the internal and sustainable growth rates of the companies over the investigated period. The minor difference identitied between the internal (IGR) and sustainable growth (SGR) rates can he considered as normal, since the investigated firms were using foreign sources as well in order to finance their activities. In terms of risk indicators, it was found that of the degree of operating leverage (DOL) and the degree of financial leverage (DFL) it is the degree of operating leverage that appears to be the major source of problems for the investigated fines. Thus, risk managers should be giving priority attention to minimizing it. Our analyses show that the majority (64%) of the enterprises have an acceptable level of risk. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This article based on the Carroll's three pillar CRS model, while the environmental pillar was selected as the most important one. On the sample of 58 Slovak enterprises we are verifying presence of a statistically significant effect of the legal form and number of employees (SME size category) on the implementation of environmental issues in the company. In the methodology we are using descriptive statistics, non-parametric methods (The Kruskal-Wallis Test, Jonckheere - Terpstra Test) and Crombach Alpha. The results of the analysis shows that the corporate legal form has no impact on the application of environmental policy, but there is an impact of the number or employees, respectively SME size category. Micro enterprises are not involved in the raising awareness on environmental policy and responsibility on the same extent as small companies. Similar differences between this two size groups we find in their extent of dealing with environmental research and development and protection of the natural environment. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Although the margin tax diverges from a simple turnover tax in several respects, the modifications generally do not make the tax more efficient.

This captures a type of contagion where each downward jump in an asset's price results in increased likelihood of further jumps, both in that asset and in the other assets. We solve in closed-form the dynamic consumption-investment problem of a log-utility investor in such a contagion model, prove its optimality and discuss features of the solution, including flight-to-quality. The clustering of jumps gives rise to a time-varying optimal asset allocation: as jumps predict more jumps, the portfolio should be optimally rebalanced to hedge the risk of future jumps. The exponential and power utility investors are also considered: in these cases, the optimal strategy can be characterized as a distortion of the strategy of a corresponding non-contagion investor.","[Ait-Sahalia, Yacine] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ait-Sahalia, Yacine] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hurd, Thomas Robert] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; McMaster University,"Ait-Sahalia, Y (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Ait-Sahalia, Y (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Ait-Sahalia, Y (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",yacine@princeton.edu,,,NSF; NSERC; MITACS Canada,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MITACS Canada,"We are grateful for comments and suggestions from the editor, Eric Ghysels, two anonymous referees, and from seminar participants at Cambridge University, Columbia University, Harvard University, MIT, Peking University, SMU, the Financial Risks International Forum (Paris 2012), the Quantitative Methods in Finance Conference (Sydney, 2014), and the Society for Financial Econonetrics (Toronto, 2014), where this article was delivered as the Halbert White Jr Memorial JFEC Invited Lecture.

When applying this design to the case of Belgium, we find that age discrimination depends fundamentally on the older candidates' career patterns.

The paper focuses on the role of institutions and social capital in molding this relationship. The results indicate that evading taxes is negatively associated with individuals' life satisfaction. This negative relationship seems to be shaped by a positive perception of formal tax-related institutions and a high level of formal social capital. A similar analysis run for two generational groups, distinguished in terms of whether having had working experience during communism, yields further interesting results: while associational engagement (i.e. formal social capital) has a crucial role to the younger generation in the way they experience the relationship between evading tax and how satisfied they are with their life, for the older generation it is their social networks (i.e. informal social capital) that shape this relationship.

Both measures are associated with macroeconomic conditions and indicators of monetary policy, but the relations differ qualitatively. In particular, average individual inflation uncertainty is higher during periods of expansionary monetary policy, whereas disagreement rises during contractionary periods. This implies that conclusions based on disagreement as a single indicator of ex ante uncertainty are incomplete and potentially misleading. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While hiring bankers helps create a surplus that can be split between a firm and its trading counterparties, hiring traders helps the firm appropriate a greater share of that surplus away from its counterparties. Firms bid defensively for workers bound to become traders, who then earn more than bankers. As counterparties employ more traders, the benefit of employing bankers decreases. The model sheds light on the historical evolution of compensation in finance.","[Glode, Vincent] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lowery, Richard] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Glode, V (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,Cynthia and Bennett Golub Endowed Faculty Scholar award,Cynthia and Bennett Golub Endowed Faculty Scholar award,"Vincent Glode is from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

The presented method has the advantages of the lower data requirements and the utility of the results. Three benchmarks were selected to evaluate transit accessibility. The first one (transit coverage) investigates the spread of the service, and it is used to assess the percentage of people in a district that can access the service within a comfortable access distance. The second (transit supply) is an effectiveness measure of the magnitude of available infrastructures such as stops, or stations over the population or land area of the underlying region. The third (route diversity) represents the variety of routes to and from different areas via transit services. Various indicators were used to assess these benchmarks. Within the context of multi-criteria decision-making, TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) allows the direct comparison of measures of different units, and it is used to evaluate the relative scores of the various districts' benchmark. A K-clustering method was used to numerically categorize the areas into five groups, reflecting on the criteria levels. A case study of Abu Dhabi city is used to demonstrate the details of the procedures. The detailed analyses were used to depict districts and corridors with particular deficiencies and as such suggesting remedy strategies. The method can help transit authorities identifying the most suitable types of facilities, infrastructure, or routes that a district may need to improve its accessibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

I control for contemporaneous shocks to demand and supply by constructing a detailed supply curve for fossil generation and intersecting it with residual demand for fossil-based electricity for every hour. Determining the marginal generator allows me to use marginal fuel and allowance costs (rather than prices) as explanatory variables in order to identify the level of cost pass-through directly and with a high level of precision. I find that allowance costs are passed through to electricity prices completely (or nearly completely) on average, but that the degree of pass-through varies over the load curve. My results suggest that there is no economic reason for free allowance allocation to the German electricity sector, and thus I support the updated allocation rules in phase 3 of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.","[Hintermann, Beat] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Hintermann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",b.hintermann@unibas.ch,,,,,,,34,59,62,5,45,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Using a sample that includes U.S. domestic deals completed between 1986 and 2012, we find that the presence of ratings significantly affects the M &A premiums paid in mergers and acquisitions (M &As). M &A premiums paid are lower in deals involving rated as opposed to nonrated firms. Assuming that the presence of ratings mitigates the problem of information asymmetry and allows bidders to pay a fair price for a target, then the post-M &A performance of bidders of rated targets would be superior. Indeed, we find that the presence of ratings and bidders' post-M &A operating performance are positively related.","[Jory, Surendranath R.] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Ngo, Thanh N.] East Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Wang, Daphne] Jacksonville Univ, Jacksonville, FL USA",University of Southampton; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Jacksonville University,"Jory, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",S.R.Jory@soton.ac.uk; ngotn@ecu.edu; dwang@ju.edu,"Wang, Daphne/L-1007-2018","Wang, Daphne/0000-0003-0938-6360; Jory, S R/0000-0002-8265-0001",,,,,47,16,18,1,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This article analyzes business groups in three countries, China, Japan, and Sweden, by providing a view as to why and how business groups solve economic problems, and how the specific national context of the group affects its substance and performance. Our first observation is that the business groups studied emerged at times of institutional instability and persisted, thanks to cooperative capitalism and an export-oriented economy. Second, our business groups have used a diversification strategy at the group level in order to share risks and reduce costs at the firm level. Third, business groups seemed to reduce problems associated with high management costs and risk when many industries were held together in a single, large enterprise. With regard to internal markets, there seemed to be national differences in intra-firm behavior and the ways in which national governments mobilized business groups to reach certain economic and social goals. The emergence and persistence of successful business groups indicate that the Anglo-Saxon model of the firm is neither the only one, nor superior.","[Zhang, Lihua] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sjogren, Hans] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Sjogren, Hans] Stockholm Sch Econ, Inst Econ & Business Hist Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kishida, Miki] Setsunan Univ, Dept Econ, Osaka, Japan",Tongji University; Linkoping University; Stockholm School of Economics; Setsunan University,"Zhang, LH (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jasminezh93@gmail.com; hans.sjogren@liu.se; miki.kishida@ma6.seikyou.ne.jp,,,China National Science Foundation [71503184]; Shanghai Pujiang Foundation [15PJC095],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Foundation(Shanghai Pujiang Program),This paper is sponsored by the China National Science Foundation (Project NO.: 71503184) and Shanghai Pujiang Foundation (Project NO.: 15PJC095).

Our results for the S&P 500 and WTI Crude Oil futures contracts show that simple linear quantile regressions for returns and heterogenous quantile autoregressions for realized volatility perform very well in capturing the dynamics of the respective conditional distributions, both in absolute terms as well as relative to a couple of well-established benchmark models.

In-sample analysis indicates that stock return or Federal Funds rate difference Granger causes bond volatility of all maturities. The forecasting ability of other variables mainly appears at the short end of the term structure or during the relatively turbulent time. Out-of-sample analysis suggests little evidence of forecast improvement, though forecast combination does improve the performance. Decomposing the out-of-sample forecasts indicates that the poor performance is primarily attributed to overfitting, and variable reduction by principal components does not change the results.

We use new micro-data on mutual funds' holdings of securitizations to examine which investors are susceptible to such boom-time thinking. We show that firsthand experience plays a key role in shaping investors' beliefs. During the 2003-2007 mortgage boom, inexperienced fund managers loaded up on securitizations linked to nonprime mortgages, accumulating twice the holdings of more seasoned managers. Moreover, inexperienced managers who personally experienced severe or recent adverse investment outcomes behaved more like seasoned managers. Training and institutional memory can serve as partial substitutes for personal experience. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the overconfident insider chooses to trade in an alternating way in the sense that he underreacts to his information in the first period, overreacts in the second, underreacts in the third, overreacts in the fourth, and so on. The irrational insider trades in this way not only to dissimulate his information but also to equalize his profits across periods. The coexistence of public disclosure and heterogeneous prior beliefs leads to large and fluctuant trading volumes, and the more underconfident the insider is, the greater is the degree of fluctuation. Also, contrarian and momentum trading arise en-dogenously as a result of the insider's irrationality and the public disclosure. Finally, we present the economic explanation for our model by giving the Granger causality relationship between the amended price series and the insider's trading order series. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The price shocks are absorbed immediately in two or three days, suggesting that all markets are quite efficient. A slight mean reversion and an overshooting behavior are observed. Considering the volatility spillover effect, we highlight two properties of volatility shocks. First, the effects of the volatility shocks are released gradually. Reaching peak volatility spillover levels would require five to ten days. Second, the dynamics of volatility spillovers vary tremendously over time. Different types of markets respond to certain, but not all, extreme events. Our findings suggest the need to conduct investor monitoring of current events instead of using technical analysis based on historical data. Investors should also diversify their portfolios using assets that can respond to different and extreme shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The article presents results from an empirical study, where 80 riders of a networked fleet of e-bikes discuss their experience of smart velomobility. The results show how digital and physical mobilities merge, the way riders of the networked fleet interact with the data, how they share the data and how they feel tracked (privacy). The conclusion sketches out future research of smart velomobilities and also points out the policy and innovation potential of cycling as active, sustainable and networked mode of transport in the context of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.

We investigate the relevance of each of these three dimensions of liquidity - separately and in conjunction - for the pricing of corporate bonds. Unlike previous studies, our sample allows us to cleanly separate the default and non-default components of yield spreads. We find that each of the above three dimensions of liquidity are priced factors. Overall, in our sample, a one standard deviation change in trading costs, resiliency, and depth measures lead to a change in non-default spreads of 5.00 basis points, 2.27 basis points, and 1.27 basis points, respectively. We also find that both bond-specific and market-wide dimensions of liquidity are priced in non-default spreads. Finally, we find that there does exist in some periods a small residual non-default yield spread that is consistent with an additional flight-to-extreme-liquidity premium reflecting investor preference for assets that enable quickest possible disengagement from the market when necessary.

While the former depends on the total amount of information available, the latter depends on the relative amounts of hard and soft information. Disclosing more hard information (e.g., earnings) increases total information, raising financial efficiency and reducing the cost of capital. However, it induces the manager to prioritize hard information over soft by cutting intangible investment to boost earnings, lowering real efficiency. The optimal level of financial efficiency is non-monotonic in investment opportunities. Even if low financial efficiency is desirable to induce investment, the manager may be unable to commit to it. Optimal government policy may involve upper, not lower, bounds on financial efficiency.","[Edmans, Alex] CEPR, London, England; [Edmans, Alex] LBS, London, England; [Huang, Chong] UC Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London Business School; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Edmans, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Edmans, A (通讯作者)，LBS, London, England.",aedmans@london.edu,"Edmans, Alex/F-9562-2011",", Mirko/0000-0003-0602-8701",,,,,68,49,58,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Behavioural warm glow is measured using the crowded-out charity dictator game of Crumpler and Grossman (2008). In the give treatment, subjects could donate any part of their endowment to charity where their donations completely crowd out the charity's own initial endowment. In the give/take treatment, the option to take any part of the charity's endowment was added to the subjects' choice set. Experienced warm glow is measured by a series of post-decision self-reports of positive affect. Within each treatment behavioural and experienced warm glow are positively correlated, such that the more subjects donated to charity the better they claimed to feel about themselves. However, when comparing across treatments the addition of the take option results in a fall in behavioural warm glow but a rise in experienced warm glow. We interpret these results as evidence for (i) a utility function increasing in both money and morality and (ii) a type of moral relativism whereby the morally good action is defined in relation to the available options. This means that utility is derived from both the chosen option and from foregone opportunities, the implication of which is that the transitivity axiom becomes practically unfalsifiable.

We employ a Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) model which combines the advantages of traditional VAR modelling with those of a panel-data approach. In addition to variables that proxy for global and financial market spread determinants we also employ variables that proxy for behavioral determinants. We find that the determinants of CDS variance are neither uniform nor stable during different periods and different countries. For instance, as we move from 2008 to 2014 the impact of the slope of the term structure on CDS spread variance is increasing for peripheral countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Ireland, and decreasing for core countries such as Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Austria. Other findings indicate that investor sentiment was an important CDS spread determinant during the subprime crisis, along with other factors, while spillover effects run from larger peripheral economies such as Spain and Italy to core countries; spillover effects from Portugal, Greece, and Ireland are of minor importance.

There is only one source of risk, and the expert is privately informed about the risky asset's volatility. When monetary transfers are unenforceable, we show that investors may delegate their investment decisions to the expert. When doing so, however, they impose restrictions on her choices which crucially depend on whether the expert perceives investors' asset allocations as complements or as substitutes.

We document that by employing targets' ex-advisors, acquirers pay lower takeover premiums and secure a larger proportion of merger synergies. The corresponding targets exhibit lower announcement returns and are less likely to be propositioned by competing bidders. These results indicate that acquirers take advantage of value-relevant information about targets through targets' ex-advisors, and achieve bargaining advantages in deal negotiations. In contrast, we document no discernible value effects when targets hire acquirers' ex-advisors, suggesting that the information role of acquirers' ex-advisors hired by targets is weaker than that of targets' ex-advisors hired by acquirers.

The extent to which geographical and man-made land constraints influence housing prices and quantities is explored. Using a sample of 35 cities in China from 2003 to 2012, I find that cities with less naturally available land have experienced greater price appreciation and the quantity response is less in those places. The results imply that geography matters in Chinese housing markets where land is discretely allocated by the government. In cities where there is more land naturally available, the government may be less concerned about the loss of arable land and be more permissive with development. Moreover, my findings imply that the allocation of land use via government decision in China is quasi-exogenous to changes in housing price and quantity, suggesting that decisions by governments about land supply may not be dependent on housing prices.

Here the investment to reduce risk precedes its effect. In contrast to single-period models, self-insurance and self-protection react similarly when the agent's utility function becomes more concave. Effort is increased if and only if current consumption is sufficiently large. However, if we introduce endogenous saving, an agent with more concave utility always selects more self-insurance, but will select more self-protection if and only if the probability of loss is small enough. These latter results concur with those in standard monoperiodic models with no saving.","[Hofmann, Annette] Hamburg Sch Business Adm, Hamburg, Germany; [Peter, Richard] Univ Munich, Inst Risk Management & Insurance, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Hofmann, A (通讯作者)，Hamburg Sch Business Adm, Hamburg, Germany.",annette.hofmann@hsba.de; peter@bwl.lmu.de,,,Institute for Risk and Insurance; Munich Risk and Insurance Center,Institute for Risk and Insurance; Munich Risk and Insurance Center,"We thank Harris Schlesinger for very detailed and helpful comments.

To investigate the issue, an ideal empirical framework is newly created by combining a proxy for previous corporate perception, corporate reputation, with a well-known financial market anomaly, the earnings announcement puzzle. The interdisciplinary research presented in this study is original in its methodological design. Using companies listed and traded on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX between the first quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2011, the results show that investors' buying behaviors are influenced by significant horn and dark horse effects in the stock markets. Our findings suggest a short-term trading strategy that adopts long (short) positions in low-reputation stocks with the highest (lowest) class of earnings surprise over the three-day period surrounding the earnings announcements, generating a premium of 9.984%. On the basis of the price reversal effect, our results reveal a long-term trading strategy that adopts long (short) positions in low-reputation stocks with the lowest (highest) class of earnings surprises, starting from two days after the earnings announcement. The long-short positions for thirty, forty-five and sixty consecutive trading days will respectively generate premiums of 2.672%, 5.918%, and 7.602%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the presence of an emission tax, we compare the two types of licensing contract, fixed fee and auction, and show that the preference on licensing strategy depends not only upon the level of the emission tax but also on the production cost gap. Specifically, non-exclusive licensing is preferred to exclusive licensing when the emission tax or cost gap is small, while exclusive auction (fixed fee) licensing is preferred when the cost gap is intermediate (large).

The aim of this article is to challenge this narrative by reviewing a nineteenth century discussion on the merits of different voting rules. In that discussion the social choice results had a central role. The participants in the heated dispute were both professors at the University of Helsinki: Lorenz Lindelof (1827-1908) was the Professor of Mathematics, a noted mathematician and statistician, while Johan Wilhelm Snellman (1806-1881) was the Professor of Philosophy and the unofficial intellectual leader of the Finnish national movement. Many of the arguments used by them also appear in modern treatments of social choice theory. Such basic anomalies of social choice as the Borda paradox, the Condorcet paradox, path-dependence, and strategic voting figured in the discussion.","[Lagerspetz, Eerik] Univ Turku, Dept Philosophy & Polit Sci, Assistentinkatu 7, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Turku,"Lagerspetz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Dept Philosophy & Polit Sci, Assistentinkatu 7, Turku 20014, Finland.",eerlag@utu.fi,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2016,168.0,3-4,,,,,265,277,,10.1007/s11127-016-0361-4,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DZ9BP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386168500005,0

However, across many regions, especially if regions are considerable distances apart, weather may be quite different and losses may be much less correlated. The objective of this paper is to improve the diversification of a crop insurance portfolio, through developing a new alternative risk management approach (Model 3) that pools crop risks across all provinces in a country to form a Canada-wide joint insurance pool. This is in contrast to the current approach used in Canada, where crop risks are pooled only within an individual province. Then using a simulated annealing optimization approach, the most suitable combination of the 150 crop types in the portfolio is identified for either retaining in the joint insurance pool or for ceding to reinsurers, such that the variance of the loss coverage ratio of the portfolio is minimized. This model overcomes the problem of insufficient diversification that makes pooling of systemic weather risk challenging. It achieves diversification at a lower cost by using a more efficient combination of pooling and selective reinsurance, resulting in overall higher surplus, higher survival probability, and lower deficit at ruin.","[Porth, Lysa; Pai, Jeffrey] Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Porth, Lysa; Boyd, Milton] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Porth, Lysa] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; University of Waterloo,"Porth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.;Porth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.;Porth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",lysaporth@gmail.com; Milton.boyd@umanitoba.ca; jpai@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,33,8,9,1,15,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

We also show that the higher profit is driven by the fact that low risks tend to stay longer with the insurer, and in the meanwhile, they are charged a premium higher than their actuarial risk level.","[Shi, Peng] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Actuarial Sci Risk Management & Insurance, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zhang, Wei] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Northern Illinois University,"Shi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Actuarial Sci Risk Management & Insurance, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",pshi@bus.wisc.edu; wzhang1@niu.edu,,"Shi, Peng/0000-0003-2789-3235",,,,,26,5,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This paper shows that although directors' compensation and firm performance are positively correlated, D&O insurance significantly weakens this positive relationship. Therefore, instead of providing positive incentive to boards of directors, D&O insurance may actually worsen the agency problem, which is very different from the essential idea and purpose of implementing this insurance. Specifically, with 5619 firm-year observations of 1236 listed firms in Taiwan during the period from 2008 to 2012, we show that D&O insurance reduces the sensitivity of directors' compensation to firm performance by approximately 42% for the insured firms. As a result, instead of alleviating agency problem, D&O insurance actually increases firms' agency costs. Our results are robust to alternative measures of directors' compensation, alternative measures of D&O insurance, firms' corporate governance quality, firm size, firm risk, industry characteristics, CEO's power, and different sample selections.

The motivation is to increase the disclosure of OTC transactions aiming to decrease the probability of crisis. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how regulatory changes in the OTC derivatives market affect the non-financial sector. The Brazilian FX derivatives market provides a natural experiment for this issue: in 2011, the Brazilian government taxed short positions in FX derivatives to reduce the carry trade, which was causing the local currency to appreciate. Although Chamon and Garcia (2013, Capital control in Brazil: effective? International Monetary Fund, manuscript) find that this policy helped reduce the incentives for carry trade strategies, it could have unintended consequences on other markets. For example, if banks pass through the extra cost to clients, this taxation may affect the FX hedges of non -financial firms. This paper investigates whether, and if so how much, the increase in the cost of OTC derivatives is transferred to the non -financial sector. The results indicate that this cost more than doubled for companies exposed to devaluation of the local currency (for instance, importers). Although a thorough welfare analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, the findings suggest that this cost increase may be a concern to the extent that it could prevent EME firms from hedging their FX positions, as the NDF quotation of some EMEs is high due to the interest rate differentials.

Drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm and the literature on university-industry collaboration, we examine how the level of financial slack available to a firm influences their level of explorative and exploitative knowledge sourcing from universities. We suggest that two types of proximity moderate this relationship: organizational and geographical. Using on a rich sample of university collaborators, we find-consistent with our expectations-that high levels of financial slack are associated with explorative knowledge sourcing, whereas low levels of slack are associated with exploitative knowledge sourcing. Our results also point out that organizational proximity can complement for the lack of financial slack in shaping explorative knowledge sourcing, while it can heightens the effects of low levels of financial slack on exploitative knowledge sourcing. In contrast, we find that geographical proximity plays a weaker moderating role compared to organizational proximity.

However, it is not known whether auditors are unable to detect misclassifications or if they are merely not motivated to report them. We conduct two experiments to examine this issue. Our results indicate that auditors are sensitive to classification shifting while assessing fraud risk and audit effort. However, their willingness to report such misclassifications is affected by the overall legal liability regime of the region in which their clients operate. More specifically, our results indicate that the presence of weaker legal regimes reduce the litigation risk faced by auditors which make them less likely to report misclassifications. On the other hand, auditors are significantly more likely to report misclassifications by qualifying their audit report if a company is cross-listed in a country with strong institutional controls and legal regime.

We estimate the compound option (CO) model, which views equity as an option on the firm.

The compound option effect is particularly strong for highly levered firms and long-term options, in which the pricing improvement is up to 70% of the Black-Scholes error. Without a TSV, the CO model reduces pricing errors of in-the-money options by 12.74% on average and for out-of-the-money by 9.22%.

The result indicates that there is a unidirectional relationship from inflation to money supply growth. However, considering structural changes in two series, we find that short-run relationships using full-sample data are unstable, which suggests that full-sample causality tests cannot be relied upon. Then, we use a time-varying rolling-window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationship, and the results show that money supply growth has both positive and negative impacts on inflation in several sub-periods, and in turn, inflation has the same effects on money supply growth for China. These findings are basically consistent with the modern quantity theory of money from the perspective of money supply and price level. When money supply growth does not outweigh output growth, inflation should not be curbed only by decreasing money supply. It notes that a stable money supply growth is critical to price level stability and economic development in China.","[Su, Chi-Wei; Fan, Jiao-Jiao; Li, Xiao-Lin] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan",Ocean University of China,"Li, XL (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",smileman2004@126.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [14YJA790049],National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project,"This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 15BJY155), and Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project (Grant No. 14YJA790049).

Rural areas are characterized by differences in the distance to the nearest water point and in water quality for domestic water, by watering frequency and water availability for irrigation water, and by the price for both.

The authors used a choice experiment to model how the individual status quo (SQ) affects preferences. Accounting for individual SQ information improves model significance relative to simply using the generic SQ parameter in the model, and the willingness to pay increases.

To examine whether and by which mechanisms passive investors influence firms' governance, we exploit variation in ownership by passive mutual funds associated with stock assignments to the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes. Our findings suggest that passive mutual funds influence firms' governance choices, resulting in more independent directors, removal of takeover defenses, and more equal voting rights. Passive investors appear to exert influence through their large voting blocs, and consistent with the observed governance differences increasing firm value, passive ownership is associated with improvements in firms' longer-term performance.

Compared with the existing literature, we introduce two new elements, namely, international borrowings and the relative factor-intensiveness, and examine their interplay with the welfare effects of the Dutch disease. We show that (i) when the household can freely borrow from the world financial market, the Dutch disease will not affect welfare; (ii) when the economy is closed to the world financial market, the Dutch disease is beneficial (harmful) to the residents' welfare if the tourism good sector is capital-intensive (labor-intensive). Moreover, this paper provides a simulation analysis to examine the welfare effect of both the steady-state and the transitional responses arising from a tourism boom. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Regulatory control exercised by international or European institutions provides scope for understanding functionalist rationales when comprehending the construction of 'ocean space'. This paper contributes to appreciating effective functional forms of regulation by investigating the enforcement practices and control in the international maritime tanker industry. Through a study of shipping we explore the extent that functional regulation has been implemented and how this may inform regulatory formation in other industries/sectors affected by global variables. In general, the study suggests that in the context of the shipping industry functionalism has undergone a metamorphosis in terms of normative underpinning; rather than identifying peace as the basis of non-state regulatory initiative it is triggered by wider populist views regarding political ecology (ecopolitics) and environmental sustainability. 'Ocean space' and mobilities are constructed through normative considerations that rely on agencies beyond the nation-state and implementation of regulation through functional variables.

Academics have mainly studied how civil liability can provide optimal incentives to control the level of risk. However, the role of technological change and innovation has been neglected. Innovation enables to improve the efficiency of risk prevention on the long run: to provide optimal incentives for such activities is highly important for an optimal regulation on a long-term perspective. In the late 2000s, Alfred Endres began to analyze how innovation alters the optimal setting of civil liability in a context of pollution control. In this essay, we show the relevance of such an approach in a context of risk regulation, and we highlight how the regulation of risky activities has to be distinguished from the regulation of polluting activities.","[Jacob, Julien] Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Jacob, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Nancy, France.",julien.jacob@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,43,0,0,2,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

They reveal the dominance of interdependence over spillovers and comovements when the uncertainty variables are excluded, highlighting the significance of mutual reciprocity of individual market shocks over common shocks across the selected assets. Within portfolios of a two-variable framework (two variables representing two minimum variance portfolios (a la Markowitz), containing a weighted combination of the currencies and of the commodities, respectively), we find interdependence between the two portfolios with and without the VIX, a spillover from commodities to currencies in the case when the FSI is included and independence between the two portfolios in the case when the oil-VIX is accounted for. The implications of the results are important for the portfolio managers in selecting portfolios' components during high oil volatility periods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A vast literature stream exists on decisions to buy or rent a home, and many contributions report the low participation rate of American households in the US stock market. Numerous authors have also provided evidence that home tenure (modeled as an exogenous variable) affects the share of household portfolios held as stocks. However, the present study is the first to allow decisions on homeownership and stockholding to be simultaneous and endogenous. We use a dynamic bivariate logistic panel data model on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from 1999 to 2007, controlling for sample selection bias and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. These estimates allow us to simulate the individual paths of homeownership and stockholding status over whole life cycles, according to household characteristics. Ceteris paribus, we show that households acquiring one asset (either home or stocks) acquire the other at an earlier stage in their life cycles, implying that some households become trapped in a no-stockholding, renting position.

To establish whether the impact of financial openness on both bank risk and profit efficiency occurs directly or through each one of the two bank characteristics (efficiency and risk, respectively), we begin our analysis by investigating the potential reverse Granger causality between profit efficiency and risk using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation. We then account explicitly for the role of bank risk in the estimation of bank profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, allowing for the influence of different measures of financial openness and risk alongside other control variables.

Such an event would have direct impacts on economic activities located near the coastline and indirect impacts further inland. Using data from the DIVA model on sea floods, river floods, land loss, salinisation and forced migration, we analyse the effects of these damages in a computable general equilibrium model for 25 world regions. We consider three sea-level rise scenarios that correspond to 0.47, 1.12 and 1.75 m by the 2080s. By incorporating a wider range of damage categories, implemented in an economy-wide framework and including very rapid sea-level rise, the study offers a new contribution to climate change impact studies. We find that the loss of GDP worldwide is 0.5 % in the highest sea-level rise scenario, with a loss of welfare (equivalent variation) of almost 2 % world-wide. Within these aggregates, there are large regional disparities, with the Central Europe North region and parts of South-East Asia and South Asia being especially prone to high costs (welfare losses in the range of 4-12 %). The analysis assumes that there is not public adaptation, which would substantially lower the costs. In this way, the analysis demonstrates what is at risk, and could be used to justify adaptation expenses.","[Pycroft, Jonathan; Abrell, Jan; Ciscar, Juan-Carlos] European Commiss, IPTS, Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Abrell, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pycroft, J (通讯作者)，European Commiss, IPTS, Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Jonathan.Pycroft@ec.europa.eu,"wang, baylor09/C-5190-2009","Abrell, Jan/0000-0003-1435-0952",,,,,47,24,25,7,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The special emphasis is put on the differences between countries that have already joined the European Union and those that are in different stages of integration. We introduce a specific measure of business cycle synchronisation by comparing the evolution of the growth rates in country pairs and further seek to identify determinants of these synchronisation patterns using pooled probit model. The results of the analysis have indicated that the real effective exchange rate seems to be an important predictor of synchronisation between CESSEE countries and the original Eurozone members. Our results have also indicated that trade becomes important synchronisation factor only for the countries that became EU members during the analysed period. The trade creation possibilities emerging from the common market seem to change the trade patterns in countries that became the EU members during the analysed period and contribute positively to the overall business synchronisation.

First, privatized banks tend to outperform non-privatized banks after the privatization, which is called the privatization effect. Second, we find that the privatization effect is much larger in developing countries compared to those in developed countries, suggesting that the privatization effect is systematically related to a country's level of economic development. Third, we discover that country governance enhances the privatization effect in developing countries, which is consistent with the hypothesis that countries with good governance can minimize the likelihood of political intervention via residual ownership. Conversely, we also find that country governance reduces the privatization effect in developed countries due to smaller spaces for improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By assuming that all firms are public firms initially, the paper focuses on how the degree of product differentiation and the average efficiency of the industry influence the determination of the optimal privatization policy. The paper shows that privatization decreases the more efficient firms' outputs while increases the less efficient firms' outputs in the short run, and reduces all firms' outputs in the long run. The paper also shows that the larger is and the smaller is the number of firms, the more privatized will be the public firm in the short run. Moreover, as or the entry barrier f(E) is sufficiently small, full privatization is the best policy in the long run.

In this paper, we use the National Systems of Entrepreneurship as a conceptual framework in which to question whether SMEs take-up of tax credits has actually led to an increase in product, service, or process innovations. Our evidence suggests that (a) SME engagement with the policy is fairly randomly distributed across the sector, and (b) there is little additional product-service innovation to justify the expenditure in foregone taxes given the current distribution of credits, but (c) there is evidence of enhanced radical process innovations, particularly when combined with strong capability and planning at the firm level.","[Cowling, Marc] Brighton Business Sch, Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England",University of Brighton,"Cowling, M (通讯作者)，Brighton Business Sch, Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England.",M.Cowling2@brighton.ac.uk,,"Cowling, Marc/0000-0001-5731-8712",,,,,32,37,40,5,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In normal times, the market is fully liquid and gains from trade are realized immediately. However, the equilibrium also involves periods during which liquidity dries up, which leads to endogenous liquidation costs. Traders correctly anticipate such costs, which reduces their willingness to pay. This foresight leads to a novel feedback effect between prices and market liquidity, which are jointly determined in equilibrium. The model also predicts that contagious sell-offs can occur after sufficiently bad news.","[Daley, Brendan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Green, Brett] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Duke University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Daley, B (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,"Green, Brett/GLT-7256-2022; Green, Brett/AAH-9482-2019",,,,,,55,16,20,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

It first develops a simple theoretical model where child labor and training are chosen to maximize inter-temporal household income, given constraints to social, household, and child endowments. Then, it conducts an empirical analysis using the randomized trial data collected to evaluate the 2006 Nicaragua conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. This social program transferred wealth to poor families in rural areas of the country conditional on children's school attendance and health check-ups. One-third of the beneficiaries received, in addition, a wealth transfer to begin a non-agricultural business. The paper finds that the CCT program had a selective impact on the volume and quality of child labor, reducing it in the aggregate and steering it toward skill-forming activities. Specifically, the program appears to have reduced child labor for household chores and traditional farming while increasing it for non-traditional activities related to commerce and retail. These require the child to develop basic skills in reading and writing, arithmetic, and interpersonal relationships. Moreover, the paper finds that the source behind the increase in the better-quality type of child labor is not the basic component of the program but distinctively its business-grant intervention.

This paper examines the economy-wide implications of policy changes to the means test and access age of the age pension. To this end, we applied an overlapping generations model stylised to the Australian economy, with the capacity to investigate tightening the existing means test (by increasing the taper rate at which the pension is withdrawn) and increasing the pension access age. The simulation results indicate that tightening the taper rate combined with lower income tax rates increases per capita labour supply, assets and long run welfare but reduces the welfare of current generations who have their pension cut. However, the welfare losses to current generations are shown to be mitigated by increasing the taper rate gradually over the next decade. Such reform results in a significant reduction in overall pension expenditures and has more equitable distributional implications compared to increasing the pension access age. We also show that population ageing further strengthens the case for means testing public pensions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We document that 45% of syndicated loans specify dynamic covenant thresholds in earnings-based covenants and that these changing thresholds typically become tighter over the life of a loan. We find that covenants with a tight trend provide an important signaling mechanism that meets the needs of borrowers that experience an inferior financial performance at loan initiation but expect future performance improvements. Specifically, we find that these covenants provide underperforming borrowers with a grace period by requiring less restrictive initial thresholds. At the same time, they allow these borrowers to credibly convey information to lenders about their future prospects via gradually more demanding subsequent thresholds. Our empirical evidence also suggests that while lenders entering into tight threshold trend covenant contracts receive weaker covenant protection over the grace period, they benefit from having stronger control rights in subsequent periods.

This extends our previous work by developing and employing a more comprehensive model of demographic dividends. In addition, we extend earlier analysis about the quantity-quality tradeoff using newly available NTA data for 39 countries, in contrast to the nineteen with the necessary data in our 2010 study. This permits a more detailed analysis, treating public expenditures and private expenditures separately, and considering the role of per capita income as well as fertility and child dependency in relation to human capital spending. The analysis is used in a simulation with realistic demography to show how human capital investment has varied in relation to the changing demography from 1950 to the present, and how it might be expected to change over the rest of this century. These new estimates are then used in a more comprehensive model that incorporates both human and physical capital. The analysis provides estimates of the first and second demographic dividends and how they are affected by speed of fertility decline. The timing of the effects is documented and the relative importance of investment in physical and human capital is assessed. This improves our understanding of the economic implications of the demographic dividend and particularly the second demographic dividend. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We also find a positive and significant relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning suggesting that investments in financial education could have a substantial impact on the way people think about retirement and therefore on their ability to reach retirement with adequate resources.","[Moure, Natalia Garabato] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Moure, NG (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",natalia.garabato@student.unsw.edu.au,,,ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR),ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR)(Australian Research Council),"I would like to thank my thesis supervisors, Denzil Fiebig and John Piggott, and also Olivia S.

Our results show that Japan's monetary independence has declined over time, but retains some degree of monetary autonomy due to the floating exchange rate system.

Also, it is unknown whether there can be differences in the spatial effects before and after a major housing bust. In this paper we examine spatial effects in house price dynamics. Using panel data from 363 US MSAs for 1996 to 2013, we find that there are significant spatial diffusion patterns in the growth rates of urban house prices. Lagged price changes of neighboring areas show greater effects after the 200708 housing crash than over the entire sample period of 1996-2013. In general, the findings are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity, and for various spatial weights specifications (including contiguity weights and migration flows). These results underscore the importance of considering spatial spillovers in MSA-level studies of housing price growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We study this trade-off in a model with distortionary taxes and finance rationing, and test its predictions on an international dataset. As predicted, firms facing low corporate tax rates choose high transparency, particularly if they are not very dependent on external funding. This result is confirmed by the evidence from statutory tax reforms: reductions of corporate tax rates are followed by increases in firm transparency. Moreover, firms choose higher transparency in countries with high audit quality. Investment is positively correlated with transparency, especially for firms more dependent on external finance.

(2004) to show that the official Japanese purchases of foreign exchange in 200304 seem to have lowered long-term interest rates not only in the United States, but in a wide range of countries, including Japan. It seems that this decline was triggered by the investment of the intervention proceeds in US bonds and that global portfolio rebalancing spread the resulting decline in US dollar yields to bond markets in other currencies, thus easing global monetary conditions. We also show that the global portfolio balance effect is detectable in the response of yields to large Japanese intervention in data before and after 2003/04, though the effect is weaker. While our findings contribute to a growing body of work that points to common responses across bond markets to official portfolio shifts in the form of large-scale bond purchases (quantitative easing), our analysis has the advantage of focusing on a pure portfolio shock.

Such a cointegrating relation not only makes dividends riskier in the short run than at medium horizons but also preserves the role of long-run risk: consequently, the model captures both the traditional puzzles, like the high equity premium, as well as the new evidence about the term structure of equity risk.","[Marfe, Roberto] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Marfè, R (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy.",,,"Marfe, Roberto/0000-0001-9685-9538",NCCR FINRISK of Swiss National Science Foundation; Associazione per la Facolta di Economia dell'Universita di Torino,NCCR FINRISK of Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Associazione per la Facolta di Economia dell'Universita di Torino,"I would thank two anonymous referees, Ravi Bansal, Pierre Collin-Dufresne, Stefano Colonnello, Giuliano Curatola, Marco Della Seta, Jerome Detemple, Christian Gollier, Campbell Harvey, Elisa Luciano, Giovanna Nicodano, Michael Rockinger and Lukas Schmid for helpful comments.

Government enforcement agencies often send teams of inspectors instead of a sole inspector to a regulated facility. Yet, determining the impact of teams is problematic due to endogeneity (e. g., the enforcement agency might naturally send larger teams when they expect more violations). Exploiting weather-related exogenous variation in the number of inspectors who are sent to offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, we show that adding an inspector to a team increases the number of sanctions issued as well as the severity of the sanctions. This increase in sanction severity is larger than that of an additional inspection. Therefore, enforcement agencies may be able to achieve stricter enforcement by reallocating inspectors into larger inspection teams, even if this is at the cost of conducting fewer inspections.","[Muehlenbachs, Lucija; Staubli, Stefan] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Muehlenbachs, Lucija; Cohen, Mark A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Staubli, Stefan] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA; [Staubli, Stefan] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cohen, Mark A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of Calgary; Resources for the Future; RAND Corporation; University of Zurich; Vanderbilt University,"Muehlenbachs, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;Muehlenbachs, L (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA.",lmuehlen@ucalgary.ca; sstaubli@ucalgary.ca; mark.cohen@owen.vanderbilt.edu,"Cohen, Mark A/H-6449-2011","Cohen, Mark A/0000-0002-1548-2773",NSF [SES-1251916],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Lucija Muehlenbachs (corresponding author) is at the University of Calgary and Resources for the Future (lmuehlen@ucalgary.ca).

Using data from 1983 to 2011, we find that significant increasing long-run trends in excess comovement have appeared since around 2000. We confirm that these increasing trends are neither an artifact of the financial crisis after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 nor the time-varying sensitivities of commodity returns to common fundamental shocks. Moreover, we find that no significant increasing trends exist in the excess comovement among off-index commodities and that the surge of global demand alone cannot explain the increasing trends.

Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effectthe propensity to realize past gains more than past lossesapplies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors' cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a unified explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation.","[Chang, Tom Y.; Solomon, David H.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Westerfield, Mark M.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Southern California; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Chang, TY (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,,,,,,59,116,141,9,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Contrary to the common expectation in the innovative persistence literature, we posit that small serial innovators also benefit from operating within patterns of creative accumulation. However, it is in the quality of the technology and in the very nature of the knowledge accumulation process that the differences between small and large serial innovators can be found. Using a sample of 811 UK-based, highly innovative companies that patented over 66,000 inventions from 1990 to 2006, we find evidence in support of our theory. While large serial innovators experience higher innovation rates due to the scale of their innovation efforts, small serial innovators benefit more from processes of search depth characterized by the internal recombination of their previous knowledge. We find that important differences exist also in the very nature of the technologies being developed by small and large serial innovators.","[Corradini, Carlo] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Battisti, Giuliana] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Demirel, Pelin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Aston University; University of Warwick; University of Nottingham,"Battisti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",c.corradini@aston.ac.uk; giuliana.battisti@wbs.ac.uk; P.Demirel@soton.ac.uk,,"Corradini, Carlo/0000-0001-9164-4108",,,,,53,9,10,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find shared auditors are observed in nearly a quarter of all public acquisitions and targets are more likely to receive a bid from a firm that has the same auditor. Moreover, these shared auditor deals are associated with significantly lower deal premiums, lower target event returns, higher bidder event returns, and higher deal completion rates. These results are driven by bids in which targets and acquirers share the same practice office of an audit firm and in which the target is small. Overall, our evidence suggests that bidders benefit from sharing an auditor with the target.

Historical research demonstrates that the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and Andean Development Corporation (CAF) converged on organisational and operational arrangements very different to what their founders had intended, and much closer to one another, as a direct result of the need to secure sufficient resources to function as viable development lenders. The findings indicate that in the absence of governments willing or able to provide significant financing out of their budgets, MDBs tend to converge towards a single organisational model in order to maintain access to international capital markets. All three MDBs examined here modified their lending and financial policies in unexpected ways and, in the case of the IADB and CAF, even restructured their original membership, specifically for the purpose of securing adequate financial resources.","[Humphrey, Chris] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Humphrey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",Christopher.humphrey@pw.uzh.ch,,,,,,,70,23,25,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Does the IFRS regime help make accounting a better business language than do other accounting regimes? That is our research question, and to answer the question we examine the effect of IFRS adoption on readability of firms' financial disclosures. As a global accounting regime, the IFRS puts greater emphasis on understandability in financial reporting than do any other existing accounting standards. In many countries, however, adopting the IFRS involves the process of translating the original IFRS into local non-English languages, and apparently, the IFRS Foundation sticks to word-for-word or literal-translation policy to ensure an adopter country's complying with the original IFRS. Understandability and literal translation, however, might be less than a good match. It is, therefore, timely and relevant to examine whether financial statement understandability has improved under the IFRS regime in non-English speaking settings. Korea serves as a real-world setting for research on readability of accounting information because Korea has two concurrent accounting regimes for two years before her complete IFRS adoption. We compare the 57 IFRS adopter firms and 943 non-such firms for readability of their disclosed financial statement footnotes. The univariate and multivariate results indicate that the IFRS-based financial statements have significantly lower, not higher, readability than those based on the local accounting standards. Results also show that minority shareholder population and firm age have significantly positive influence on the association between IFRS adoption and financial statement readability. The findings of this study have both academic and policy implications.","[Jang, Min-ho] Geumgang Univ, Dept Accounting, Nonsan, South Korea; [Rho, Joon-hwa] Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Daejon, South Korea",Chungnam National University,"Rho, JH (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Daejon, South Korea.",jhrho@cnu.ac.kr,,"Rho, Joon Hwa/0000-0001-7942-3310",National Research Foundation of Korea grant - Korean Government [NRF-014S1A5A2A01013931],National Research Foundation of Korea grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-014S1A5A2A01013931].,,33,20,26,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Design/methodology/approach - The dataset is comprised of daily aggregated values of stock purchases and sales made separately by four investor groups, namely, foreign individual investors, foreign institutional investors, domestic individual investors, and domestic institutional investors. An ex post measure of volatility introduced by Rogers and Satchell (1991) is employed. Four proxies for investor trading are considered separately in the analysis. The objective of the study is empirically addressed in the context of the Generalized Method of Moments estimation technique. Findings - In general, there exists substantial contemporaneous price impact associated with foreign equity investment in the Qatari capital market, despite the fact that foreigners' buy and sell trades are not as large as those of their domestic counterparts. More specifically, foreign institutional sales (purchases) tend to increase (reduce) market volatility. Like those of foreign institutions, the sell trades by foreign individuals have a positive impact on volatility. On the other hand, domestic institutional purchases are significantly negatively related with market volatility, whereas the sell trades by the same category have no impact on volatility. Finally, surprises in foreigners' trading volumes turn out to be responsible for adding to volatility. Practical implications - Although a sudden reversal of foreign capital flows can pose a real threat to the stability of the Qatari capital market, such capital flows are deemed to be an indispensable vehicle for enhancing the liquidity and efficiency of the market. Accordingly, policy makers in Qatar should overhaul the current foreign investment legislation to make it even more streamlined and better suited to achieving the country's strategic vision for the market. Foremost in these reforms is relaxing the stringent 25 percent foreign ownership restriction. Such a relaxation process is highly recommended to be phased in only gradually, in order to weigh its pros and cons. In this regard, the authorities concerned should consider embarking on a range of procedures intended to ward off the adverse ramifications of foreign capital outflows. Originality/value - To the author's best knowledge, no study about the impact of foreign equity flows on domestic markets has been so far conducted using trading data from the Qatari market. This work presents one such attempt.","[Ahmed, Walid M.

Dietary diversity is a proxy for the quality of diet and it measures one aspect of household food and nutritional security. Using data from the Slovak Household Budget Survey, we estimate determinants of demand for food diversity by means of linear and quantile regressions. We measure food diversity by count measure of food items consumed during a specific time period and by Berry index. While demand for food diversity has been steadily increasing since 2004, economic crisis in 2009 slightly reduced the diversity of foodstuffs consumed by Slovak households. Estimated income elasticities are consistent with the applied theoretical framework and previous studies conducted in other countries. Furthermore, results from the quantile regression reveal that the estimated coefficients significantly differ across quantiles of the dependent variables' distribution. Results further indicate that Slovak households diversify their food consumption less during the first quarter of the year and in rural areas. Individual characteristics of the household head, such as education, age or gender significantly influence diverse food consumption too. Overall, an increasing demand for food diversity was observed between 2004 and 2010 which can imply an improved quality of diet and food security of Slovak households.","[Cupak, Andrej] Narodna Banka Slovenska, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovenska Polnohospodarska Univ Nitre, Katedra Hospodarskej Politiky, Nitra, Slovakia; [Rizov, Marian] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln Business Sch, Brayford Pool, Lincs, England",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; University of Lincoln,"Cupák, A (通讯作者)，Narodna Banka Slovenska, Bratislava, Slovakia.",andrej.cupak@nbs.sk; jan.pokrivcak@uniag.sk; mrizov@lincoln.ac.uk,"Cupak, Andrej/AAD-9161-2021; Cupak, Andrej/AAS-9503-2020; Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014","Cupak, Andrej/0000-0002-3863-408X; Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980",,,,,34,6,7,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Standard accounting statements do not record the value of this subsidy, and forcing subsidized institutions to show more accounting capital will do little to curb their enhanced appetite for tail risk. This paper proposes accounting and ethical standards that would reclassify the legal safety net support a firm receives, and record the value of taxpayer support as an equity investment. The purpose is to recognize statutorily that a safety net is a contract that promises to deliver loss-absorbing equity capital to firms at times when no other equity investor will. The explicit recognition of the public's stakeholder interest in economically, politically, and administratively difficult-to-unwind firms is a first and necessary step toward assigning to their managers enforceable fiduciary duties of loyalty, competence, and care toward taxpayers. These duties are meant to parallel those that managers owe to shareholders, including the right to share in the firm's profits and to receive information relevant for assessing their investment. The second step in this process is to change managerial behavior: to implement and enforce a series of requirements and penalties that can lead managers to measure and record on the balance sheet of each subsidized firm - as a special class of equity financing - the capitalized value of the safety net subsidies it receives from its taxpayer put. Incentives to report and service this value accurately in corporate documents, and in government reports making use of them, should be enhanced by installing civil sanctions, such as a call on the personal wealth of managers and officials who can be shown to have engaged in actions intended to corrupt the reporting process, and by defining a class of particularly vexing acts of safety net arbitrage as criminal theft.","[Kane, E.

Consequently, the main aim of the article is to determine differences within the influence of fiscal deficit on the economic growth, which is caused by changes in certain groups of government expenditures and revenues. We focus on two different economic growth indicators. The first is growth rate of real GDP and the second is growth rate of potential output. The panel regression method is used which data covers 13 old EU member states in 1996 to 2013. We employ the omitted fiscal variable approach. There is a hint that every deficit to revenue substitution has no significant growth effect. The results of expenditures imply, that government should reduce deficit created by debt service. The measure has relatively stronger effect on supply side. Potential output growth can also be supported by the deficit decrease of social expenditures. Lowering government consumption is detrimental to GDP, but it is not to potential output. There are some differences between results of two types of growth. Hence government should decide, if consolidation effect is considered against GDP or potential output at first.","[Murin, Martin] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Murín, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",martin.murin@vsb.cz,"Murin, Martin/S-8419-2019","Murin, Martin/0000-0003-0070-4270",,,,,44,3,3,0,5,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This is the main reason why I argue for a shift in business ethics from a corporate- to a citizen-driven moral responsibility to build a sustainable future. Likewise, although governments are major players in any global shift towards a cleaner production, they cannot be taken as primary moral agents, due to electoral considerations that may discourage them from promoting a climate legislation which promises mostly long-term benefits, and makes sacrifices in the short- and middle-run. As an alternative, I advance a triadic model, which considers the environmentally minded citizens as the driving force of a green shift. According to this model, citizens would pressure governments to enforce climate regulations and to monitor the green claims of companies and business groups, by sanctioning them electorally if they fail to do so. Governments, in turn, would be mandated to promote new enforceable climate regulations and to provide mandatory guidelines to companies as to how to implement new cleaner technologies. Yet, the technological innovations themselves, and the investment in renewable energy should belong to the private sector, which has both the expertise and the capability to create and implement new designs and technologies for their own products.","[Palade, Brindusa] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Palade, B (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",brindusa.palade@politice.ro,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,834,843,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300069,0

The empirical analysis is based on a panel data estimator on about 14,000 municipal elections during the 2001-2010 decade and on a quasi-experimental approach focusing on the fiscal limitation treatment of municipalities (local income surcharge freeze) in the years 2001 and 2006, where the trajectory of local turnout in the concurrent general elections is used as the counterfactual. The evidence suggests that tax limits provoke: (a) a modest fall in voter turnout in mayoral elections; (b) a mild decrease in the number of mayoral candidates; (c) a sizeable widening of elected mayors' win margins and some improvement in mayors' valence proxies. The evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that the imposition of tax limits lowers the ideological stakes of local elections, favors party-line crossing, and promotes vote convergence based on the valence of candidates.","[Revelli, Federico] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti De Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Revelli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti De Martiis, Campus Luigi Einaudi,Lungo Dora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",federico.revelli@unito.it,"Revelli, Federico/G-5351-2013",,,,,,32,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2016,166.0,1-2,,,,,53,68,,10.1007/s11127-016-0312-0,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DG8GY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372322300003,0

The downward pressure on the clearing price is mainly due to the fact that the introduction of renewable generation bids with very low (even null) marginal cost, displaces to the right all kinds of conventional technologies (with higher marginal cost), including the technology which would otherwise have set the clearing market price. This right-shifted displacement of the merit-order generation curve leads to a lower wholesale clearing price, a small increment of the traded energy and a reduction of the total cost of the traded energy in the wholesale market. This is the key mechanism and its main effects on the market of the very well-known meritorder effect of the renewables. The promotion of energy-efficiency plans (industry and domestic) by policy-makers is expected to yield a reduction of the demand. As a result of the reduction of demand bids, the merit-order demand curve would experience a left-sifted displacement, which would produce a reduction of both the clearing price and the amount of traded energy. Consequently, the total cost of the traded energy also would diminish. As can be seen, the parallelism of the main effects on the market between the integration of renewable and energy efficiency evidences the existence of what can be called the merit-order effect of energy efficiency. To analyze the characteristics of this merit-order effect of the energy efficiency, a simplified model, based on the linearization of the market around the clearing point, is developed. This simplified model is also used to compare the merit-order effect of energy efficiency and renewables. A set of scenarios with energy efficiency and renewables have been generated in order to quantify the main effects on the Spanish/Iberian market for the year 2014. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Successful farmers are those that adapt to shifts in the environment to capture the opportunities from such disturbance and outperform those who do not adapt. Such farmers, the literature would suggest, are entrepreneurs, catalysts for change with a risk-taking propensity. The paper presents analysis of farmers grouped with respect to their attitude to risk. It identifies that those farmers that are risk seekers would be more accurately described as gamblers based on their performance over six years of volatility. The most successful group of farmers were risk neutral, had a strong business focus and skills, managing quite high levels of debt to good effect. They had a positive attitude to change and an ability to successfully adapt to changing conditions so best fit the broader definition of entrepreneur. The risk averse group carried less debt and also outperformed the risk seeking group with strong cash results and retained earnings. Farmers cannot be assumed to be successful catalysts for change just from their attitude to risk and a belief in their ability to manage risk; instead they are those whose results prove that they are successfully taking risks, have strong business skills and run efficient farm businesses.","[Shadbolt, Nicola M.] Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4222, New Zealand; [Olubode-Awosola, Femi] Waikato Reg Council, Waikato Mail Ctr, Private Bag 3038, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",Massey University,"Shadbolt, NM (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4222, New Zealand.",n.m.shadbolt@massey.ac.nz; Femi.Olubode@waikatoregion.govt.nz,,,,,,,44,14,14,0,29,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Users in agricultural companies often do not know the details of their licensing contracts which can lead to misuse of SW and breaches in terms and conditions. Even after the development in globalized networks and shift towards SaaS, the issues of licensing are still very relevant. Therefore, an approach on determining the SW license was proposed based on experimental evaluation in real agricultural companies. The process handles both conventional SW and cloud SaaS solutions.

People in some countries are more loss averse than in others. People in some countries express stronger preferences for income equality than do people in others, and some countries offer stronger safety nets than others do. The cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance expresses the degree to which people in a country feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and the way a country deals with the fact that the future can never be known. The author finds that uncertainty avoidance is associated with loss aversion. People are more loss averse in the domains of both portfolios and jobs in countries where uncertainty avoidance is high.

The cultural dimension of power distance expresses the degree to which the less powerful members of a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally.

The opportunities and expected outcomes related to the application of the agreement on Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) are assessed in the work. Taking into account the specificity of the researched issue, the method of in-depth (semi-structured) interview was selected. Fieldwork was carried out in February-March 2016 and, in all, 15 interviews, planned in different business sectors, were conducted. In the first part of the work, the process of exporting Georgian production is assessed. The respondents that took part in the qualitative study knew the exporting process and the related procedures quite well because they had been exporting their production to various countries for many years. According to the majority's assessment, Georgian products are exported without any impediments and, therefore, for them it turned out to be rather difficult to speak about the problems related to the process. However, individual issues being sensitive for Georgian business were revealed within the framework of the study. It is noteworthy that the difficulties the respondents spoke about are largely related to other global issues. The effect of free trade with the EU on Georgian export is assessed in the second part of the work During the research, the absolute majority of respondents had a generally positive attitude to the signing of the free trade agreement, though it turned out rather difficult for them to substantiate their attitude and provide concrete examples as for a positive effect the agreement had on the Georgian business. At the same time, the majority of the respondents stressed that they slightly experienced this effect on their business: business was exempt from the export tax, though all respondents unanimously said that they had not paid it before either; confidence for Georgian produce has risen; quality control was tightened; unified standards were elaborated; Based on the study, problems were revealed and recommendations were elaborated, the most significant of which are: elaboration of export promotion measures; organization of economic agents training courses; elaboration of concrete measures aimed at approximation to the developed countries' standards on the basis of formation of target-oriented organizations. At the same time, recommendations are given as to how it is possible to apply the free trade regime effectively,","[Tavartkiladze, Marine] Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 3 Univ St, Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Tavartkiladze, M (通讯作者)，Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 3 Univ St, Tbilisi, Georgia.",marikotava@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,74,83,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300006,0

This paper aims to investigate the links between the real exchange rate and the balance of trade. By employing cointegration technique and error correction modelling between Turkey and her major trading partner Germany, presence of J-Curve phenomenon is tested on a monthly basis over the period 2002 to 2014. We employed disaggregate data on commodity level. Use of disaggregated bilateral trade data avoids any aggregation bias. Furthermore, disaggregation at commodity level permits to weigh the effect of changes in real exchange rate on the individual industry trade balance. Empirical results provide some support for the existence of j-curve effect. Nevertheless, no single pattern of exchange rate-trade balance relationship is found to exist. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Something similar happens with intangible resources; in fact both concepts show similarities and in practice are often used interchangeably. In this paper, intellectual capital is considered as a broad concept that comprises human, relational, organizational and technological resources. In the case of family businesses, firms have a specific stock of intangible resources due to the overlap between three different systems: family, business and ownership. This stock of intangible resources can also be a source of competitive advantage when it comes to international expansion. By combining these two aspects, this research paper seeks to identify differences in the human, organizational, relational and technological resources between family and nonfamily firms, and to analyze whether family firms' stock of intangible resources influences their international strategies. There are various motivations for analyzing these questions. The first lies in the social and economic importance of family firms internationally. The second relates to these companies' need for growth. And third, the particular characteristics of these companies are the source of the differences between their intangible resources and those of nonfamily firms. In our empirical study, we used a quantitative methodology. Our target group was firms - both family and nonfamily-belonging to the Spanish wine and olive oil sectors. Our primary source of information was managers and/or owners of wineries and olive oil factories, who completed an online self-administered questionnaire. We received 418 questionnaires from the respondents, what represented a response rate of 10.7%. Our results show that the stock of intangible resources in terms of human, organizational, relational and technological resources differs between family and nonfamily firms. Moreover, we find that family firms with a better stock of intangible resources show a greater export intensity.","[Vallejo-Martos, Manuel Carlos; Fuentes-Lombardo, Guadalupe; Cano-Rubio, Miriam] Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain",Universidad de Jaen,"Vallejo-Martos, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain.",mvallejo@ujaen.es; gfuentes@ujaen.es; mcanorubio@gmail.com,"Fuentes-Lombardo, Guadalupe/E-6228-2015; VALLEJO-MARTOS, MANUEL/AAM-7985-2021",,University of Jaen (Spain) [UJA 2013/08/14]; Foundation Caja Rural of Jaen,University of Jaen (Spain); Foundation Caja Rural of Jaen,This research work has been developed thanks to a grant awarded by the University of Jaen (Spain) to make the Research Project with the code number UJA 2013/08/14 and sponsored by the Foundation Caja Rural of Jaen.,,57,0,0,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,327,338,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300040,0

Theoretical analysis of two complementary economic models demonstrates that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) typically reported by these studies can be related to an economic measure of program performance only under very restrictive conditions. This is because the ATT is usually expressed in purely physical terms (e.g., avoided deforestation) and ignores heterogeneity in the costs and benefits of conservation programs. For the same reasons, clinical trials are a misleading analogy for the evaluation of conservation programs. To be more useful for economic analyses of conservation programs, impact evaluations should work toward developing measures of program outcomes that are economically more relevant, data that would enable the evaluation of impacts on forest degradation (not just deforestation) and primary forests (not forests in general), better estimates of spatially disaggregated treatment effects (not program-wide averages), and better information on the accuracy of estimated treatment effects as predictors of future risks.","[Vincent, Jeffrey R.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Jeff.Vincent@duke.edu,"Vincent, Jeffrey/JZU-1149-2024",,,,,,51,26,29,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We discuss the tradeoff between (i) allowing more than two grades, but risking the paradox, and (ii) precluding the paradox, but restricting voters to two grades.","[Brams, Steven J.] NYU, Dept Polit, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Potthoff, Richard F.] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Potthoff, Richard F.] Duke Univ, Social Sci Res Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA",New York University; Duke University; Duke University,"Brams, SJ (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Polit, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",steven.brams@nyu.edu; potthoff@duke.edu,"Potthoff, Richard/AAJ-4233-2020",,,,,,23,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2015,165.0,3-4,,,,,193,210,,10.1007/s11127-015-0303-6,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DD6ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370074300002,0

This study addresses this gap by using Fairlie-Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to disentangle the extent to which age-training gaps are due to directly age-related, coefficient effects and differences in observable characteristics. We analyse both workers and non-workers using data for 15 European Union countries from the European Union Labour Force Survey (2004-2010). The results show that direct age-related effects reflecting, for example, the preferences of older people and attitudes toward them are only part of the explanation for age-training gaps. For older workers significant mitigating factors are the combination of higher overall training rates and high rates of employment participation for older people. This combination of factors is found in the Nordic countries of Sweden and Denmark and in sectors that are predominately publicly owned. The longer tenure of older workers, particularly men, also works to narrow age-training gaps. In contrast, the lower educational base of older people adversely affects their training take-up. However the most significant factors that make it more likely that an older person will undertake training are having a job in the first place and being female. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Relative to other developed countries, the United States fares poorly on standard indicators of early-life health, and this disadvantage may have profound consequences not only for population well-being, but also for economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy. In this paper, we first discuss the research on the strength of the link between early-life health and adult outcomes, and then provide an evidence-based review of the effectiveness of existing U.S. policies targeting the early-life environment. We conclude that there is a robust and economically meaningful relationship between early-life conditions and well-being throughout the life cycle, as measured by adult health, educational attainment, labor market attachment, and other indicators of socioeconomic status. However, there is some variation in the degree to which current policies in the United States are effective in improving early-life conditions. Among existing programs, some of the most effective are the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), home visiting with nurse practitioners, and high-quality, center-based early-childhood care and education. In contrast, the evidence on other policies such as prenatal care and family leave is more mixed and limited.

We evaluate a DV program using a panel of health plan enrollment data from a large, single-site employer. We find that dependents were 2.7 percentage points less likely to be reenrolled in the year that DV was introduced, indicating that this fraction of dependents was ineligibly enrolled prior to the program's introduction. There is some evidence consistent with the notion that these dependents were actually ineligible, rather than merely discouraged from reenrollment by compliance costs.

Historical evidence links the currency composition of reserves to currency movements. The currency composition of reserves is strongly related in the cross-section to both currency movements and the currency denomination of trade. Data limitations make it hard to distinguish these two factors. A panel analysis of 5 countries from central and Eastern Europe shows that both trade invoicing and currency movements drive changing official reserve composition.

By contrast, the probabilities of being diabetic among male white-collar workers increase more rapidly with age than they do for male blue-collar workers.

The vast majority of the existent literature has focused on the relationship between parents' education and income and the education and income of their children. Surprisingly, much less work has been done on the intergenerational transmission, or correlations of health. The main objective of this paper is to examine the correlations of health across generations using the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). We take advantage of the richness of IFLS and examine several health measures of respondents, including self-reports and physical measurements. As measures of health of both parents, IFLS has information on whether they are dead at the time of the last wave in 2007, their general health status and whether they have difficulties with any ADLs at the time of the survey or in the year before death. The findings suggest strong intergenerational correlations between the measures of parental health, schooling, and the health of their adult children. We also examine how these intergenerational correlations might differ for respondents born in the more developed parts of Indonesia compared to the less developed areas. Interestingly, these health associations are lower for respondents who were born in Java or Bali. These are areas of Indonesia that have experienced the most rapid economic growth over the past 40 years. This suggests that being born and growing up in developed areas, which may have better health infrastructure, substitutes for the influence of parental health. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

From its inception in 1965, Head Start not only provided early childhood education, care, and services for children, but also sought to promote parents' success. However, almost all evaluation studies of Head Start have focused solely on children's cognitive and social outcomes rather than on parents' outcomes. The present study examines whether children's participation in Head Start promotes parents' educational advancement and employment. We use data from the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS), a randomized trial of over 4,000 newly entering three-and four-year-old children. We find that parents of children in the three-year-old cohort (but not the four-year-old cohort), who were randomly assigned to and participated in Head Start, had steeper increases in their own educational attainment by child age six years compared to parents of children in the control group. This pattern is especially strong for parents who had at least some college experience at baseline, as well as for African-American parents. We do not find evidence that Head Start helped parents enter or return to the workforce over time. Results are discussed in the context of using high-quality early childhood education as a platform for improving both child and parent outcomes.

The objective of this article is to provide an analysis of the potential relationships between the quality of external audit (assessed through membership to the Big Four: the largest four auditing firms, namely PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte) and financial performance (assessed by profitability, assets quality and solvency) of the banking system in Romania. Hence, the authors tried to find answers, advocated by the results of the conducted empirical analysis, to the following questions: Does the quality of external audit affects the financial performance of banks in Romania? How is registered the added value of external audit quality at credit institutions level? In order to test the assumptions made, it was used a predominantly quantitative research methodology, which is based on a deductive statistical analysis. The starting point is agency theory, the main objective is to test and identify the potential cause-effect relationships, while analyzing their significance weight. As a result of this research, it can be concluded that there is a positive correlation between external audit quality and financial performance of the credit institutions in the Romanian banking system, although it is not a significant one.","[Bunea, Mariana; Turlea, Carmen] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Siminica, Marian] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Craiova,"Bunea, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mariana.bunea@cig.ase.ro,"Bunea, Mariana/B-7157-2014","Bunea, Mariana/0000-0003-2879-2065; Siminica, Marian/0000-0003-2944-4791",,,,,16,4,5,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1273,1288,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300012,0

Among banks without foreign affiliates, cross-sectional differences in response to liquidity risk depend on the banks' shares of core deposit funding, Tier 1 capital, and outstanding credit commitments. Among banks with foreign affiliates, the global banks, liquidity management strategies as reflected in internal borrowing and lending across the global organization matter. This intrabank borrowing serves as a shock absorber and affects lending growth to domestic and foreign customers.

Using the IBRN methodology detailed in Buch and Goldberg (2015), which compares cross-sectional differences in these changes to cross-sectional differences in various bank characteristics, it finds no single bank characteristic to be a consistent source of liquidity risk in Australia. There are indications that greater liquid asset shares and deposit funding support lending, but these do not survive various robustness checks. Overall, the paper concludes that developments at banks in Australia during the financial crisis were not driven by cross-sectional differences in vulnerability to liquidity risk.

Surprisingly, the role of asset-pricing models and firm characteristics in the estimation of idiosyncratic risk measures has been largely neglected. Our results suggest that investment and profitability, presumably driven by managers and therefore linked to idiosyncratic risk, are able to account for the anomaly in a cross-section of stock returns.

Trade among Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China has registered record highs in recent years, and capital flow has grown exponentially. The paper applies structural vector autoregressive models to the Taiwan and Hong Kong economies to investigate the impacts of the Chinese economy over the past decade. Identification of the structural shocks is based on the fact that Mainland China has a causal effect on Taiwan and Hong Kong, but not the reverse. Our identification scheme generalizes that in Blanchard and Quah (1989) and considers both short-run restrictions and long-run restrictions. Based on a New Keynesian model, a simple model with four domestic variables namely output, interest rate, price level and real exchange rate, as well as two foreign variables namely Mainland China output and the China monthly index of economic policy uncertainty, is constructed. By considering the short-run and the long-run impacts, we attempt to address the following issues: (i) Is domestic output, or some other domestic variables, affected by the uncertain economic conditions? (ii) Is it a long-run effect, or simply a short-run effect? (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The key innovation is to decompose the indirect effects of trade costs (on prices) into the effects on markups, quality and productivity while measuring/interpreting the pass-through of trade costs into welfare. Robust to the consideration of variable versus constant markups, there is evidence for incomplete pass-through, mostly due to the negative indirect effects of trade costs on marginal costs, suggesting that lower trade costs are associated with imports that have higher marginal costs; markups are affected relatively less. When the effects of trade costs on marginal costs are further decomposed into their components, the positive contribution of quality dominates in all cases, followed by the negative effects of productivity, suggesting that lower trade costs are associated with higher-quality imports that have been produced with lower productivity.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Yilmazkuday, H (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",hyilmazk@fiu.edu,"Yilmazkuday, Hakan/GXZ-6757-2022","Yilmazkuday, Hakan/0000-0002-8629-6230","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1030164] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,28,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Bils et al. (2012) show that, while these shocks are needed to reduce the excessive inflation persistence generated by the models, they give rise to unrealistically volatile reset price inflation. This paper shows that introducing heterogeneity in price stickiness in the models overcomes these criticisms directed at them. The incorporation of heterogeneity in price stickiness reduces the need for large price shocks. With smaller price shocks, the new model comes close to matching the data on reset inflation.

We consider two climate policy scenarios from two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), in which radiative forcing levels are reached in 2100. The policy tool is a global uniform tax on all GHG emissions in the integrated assessment model WITCH. The resulting consumption patterns of fossil fuels are used to estimate the physical impacts and the economic benefits of pollution reductions on human health and on key assets by implementing the most advanced version of the ExternE methodology with its impact pathway analysis. The mitigation scenario compatible with + 2 degrees C (RCP 2.6) reduces total pollution costs in Europe by 84%. Discounted cumulative ancillary benefits are equal to about (sic)1.7 trillion between 2015 and 2100, or (sic)17 per abated tonne of CO2 in Europe. The less strict climate policy scenario (RCP 4.5) generates benefits equal to (sic)15.5 per abated tonne of CO2.

At the country level, banks operating in the smallest financial systems and the countries most affected by the financial crises realize the lowest scale economies (including diseconomies) due to the reduction in production capacity. As for the determinants of scale economies, these mainly emanate from banks oriented toward investment banking, with higher liquidity, lower Tier 1 capital, those that contributed less to systemic risk during the crises, and those with too-big-to-fail status.

This relationship reflects a procompetitive effect induced by cheaper imports, and, thanks to the firm-level dimension of our data, we show that it is driven by low-productivity firms within less skill-intensive sectors.

This timing can be disrupted by a large shock that destroys thousands of buildings, which could then have substantial short-run and long-run effects. Studying the impact of an urban disaster, therefore, can provide unique insight into urban dynamics. Exploiting the 1906 San Francisco Fire as an exogenous reduction in the city's building stock, this paper examines residential density across razed and unburned areas between 1900 and 2011. In prominent residential neighborhoods, density increased at least 60 percent in razed areas relative to unburned areas by 1914, and a large density differential still exists today. These outcomes suggest that thriving cities face substantial redevelopment frictions in the form of durable buildings and that large shocks can greatly alter the evolution of urban land-use outcomes over time.

Moreover, nutrient intakes gradually affect child health, so it is helpful to use alternative tools to evaluate short-term interventions versus long-term food policies. This article emphasizes the role of diet quality reflected in the intake of nutrients such as protein, calcium, and iron for children's physical growth. Vitamins A and C are important for reducing morbidity. Children's growth and morbidity affect their cognitive development, which is critical for the future supply of skilled labor and economic growth. Evidence on these issues from countries such as Bangladesh, India, Kenya, the Philippines, and Tanzania is summarized. The supply of nutritious foods is appraised from the viewpoint of improving diet quality.

First, we find that an investor's style has a biological basis and is partially ingrained in an investor from birth. Second, we show that an investor's hedging demands as well as behavioral biases explain investment style. Finally, an investor's style is explained by life course theory in that experiences, both earlier and later in life, are related to investment style. Investors with adverse macroeconomic experiences (e.g., growing up during the Great Depression or entering the labor market during an economic recession) or who grow up in a lower socioeconomic status rearing environment have a stronger value orientation several decades later.

It looks in particular at changes in business models and investments in intangibles. We compared firms that continued to be managed through an existing business model with matched firms that changed their business model over the period. We found that a modification of the business model has a positive effect on the ability of the firm to perform well. There was also a positive complementary effect on performance of business model change and intangibles. These results are even more evident when business model changes were categorised by their degree of innovation, suggesting that business model innovation is core to firm performance and that intangibles are positive moderators. They play a crucial role in shaping the firm's competences, which favour the success of an innovative business model configuration.","[Cucculelli, Marco] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; [Bettinelli, Cristina] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Bergamo,"Bettinelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Via Caniana 2, Bergamo, Italy.",cristina.bettinelli@unibg.it,"Cucculelli, Marco/J-2479-2019","Cucculelli, Marco/0000-0003-0035-9454",,,,,97,126,137,7,187,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The feedbacks between these two policy instruments are rarely discussed. A simple agricultural household model assesses the impact of a payment for environmental services on both deforestation and harvesting, and the impact of increasing the control on illegal harvesting on deforestation. When land and labor are substitutes, both policies have positive feedbacks and win-win potential. Conversely, when production factors are complements, they have negative feedbacks. A novel result is that the production factors can become substitutes if distance costs are high, making a win-win situation more likely.

The effect of internal information quality on tax avoidance is stronger for firms in which information is likely to play a more important role. For example, firms with greater coordination needs because of a dispersed geographical presence benefit more from high internal information quality. Similarly, firms operating in a more uncertain environment benefit more from the quality of their internal information in helping them to reduce ETRs. In addition, we provide evidence that high internal information quality allows firms to achieve lower ETRs without increasing the risk of their tax strategies (as measured by ETR volatility). Overall, our study contributes to the literature on tax avoidance by providing evidence that the internal information environment of the firm is important for understanding its tax avoidance outcomes.

The research on CE has evolved over the last 40 years beginning very slowly and growing in importance through the decades. While the inherent value of entrepreneurial action on the part of established organizations has been established, there remains a greater need for further research about CE in organizational settings. Fortunately, knowledge accumulation on the topic of CE has been occurring at a rapid rate, and many of the elements essential to constructing a theoretically grounded understanding of the domains of CE can now be identified. However, despite the recent expansion in CE research, the theoretical and empirical knowledge about the domain of CE and the entrepreneurial behavior on which it is based are still key issues that warrant a deeper understanding. Ongoing scholarly work has also raised new and important research questions and identified further theoretical avenues requiring exploration. In this article, we review some of the significant research work that has been done in the CE literature and examine the future directions for CE researchers. The increasing value of future research in this domain, including the research highlighted in this special issue, may very well enhance the innovative challenges confronting organizations in this new global economic reality.","[Kuratko, Donald F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Hornsby, Jeffrey S.] Univ Missouri, Bloch Sch Management, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Hayton, James] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; University of Warwick,"Kuratko, DF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dkuratko@indiana.edu; hornsbyj@umkc.edu; James.Hayton@WBS.ac.uk,"Hayton, James/HDN-4967-2022",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,89,126,127,0,168,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Labor migration and offshoring supported by FDI affect wage deals by changing the outside options of workers and firms. Unemployed workers may find alternative jobs either in the legal or in the illegal labor markets. Wages in this latter case are highly affected by migrants crowding this segment more than any other market. Firms may have the option of moving production partly or entirely to foreign low-cost countries. A wage curve is designed theoretically, reflecting cross-border labor and capital mobility, and estimated on panel data for 13 European countries over the period 1995-2013. The theoretical predictions of a joint negative effect on wages of FDI outflows and labor migration inflows are confirmed with some novel results.","[Rossini, Gianpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Podrecca, Elena] Univ Trieste DEAMS, Trieste, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Trieste,"Rossini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",gianpaolo.rossini@unibo.it,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The first part of the research examined the differences of CIM in five different settlements in 2011: inner city, suburban, large town, small town, and rural village. A cross-sectional survey was used on a total of 821 7- to 15-year-old children in various settlements in different parts of Finland. Independent mobility was operationalized both as mobility licenses, meaning parental permits to perform certain activities independently, and as actual mobility, the proportion of active and independent school travel and independent weekend activities. In the second part of the study, we used the same measures to compare the independent mobility of Finnish children in the 1990s and 2010s. The second sample consisted of a total of 306 8- to 10-year-old children and their parents who participated in the CIM study in 1993-94 or in 2011. The major finding of the study was that in Finland children's independent mobility had decreased significantly during a span of 20 years, even more noticeably in the small town and rural village settings than in the inner city settlements. Finnish children, nevertheless, still enjoy a very high degree of independent mobility when compared with the children from the 16 countries involved in the large international comparative study for which the current research was conducted. In the discussion, we give some possible factors that can provide some understanding of and explanation to these trends. (C) 2015 The Authors.

When both policies are available, the optimal policy combination is partial privatization and a positive tariff. Moreover, if one of the two policies is not available, the optimal trade liberalization and optimal privatization would be equivalent in welfare as long as the demand is linear. Implementing privatization and/or trade policies obtains the win-win situation for two countries. Besides, the effect of full privatization on welfare is ambiguous and depends crucially on the difference between firms' marginal cost. Lastly, by adopting a low degree of privatization block trade may increase domestic welfare. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that when a fund uses complex trading strategies involving the use of CDS team-managed funds outperform solo-managed funds. This may be due to the greater diversity of expertise, experience and skill of teams relative to single managers. During the financial crisis, however, the performance premium of teams becomes negative, which may be because of the slower decision times of teams, which are especially costly during times of rapidly changing market conditions.

Quantitative assessment indicators which are generated from a central bank's public statement with the balance statistic method are used to estimate Taylor-type rules. This procedure allows to directly capture a policymaker's assessment of macroeconomic variables which are relevant for the decision making process. As an application of the proposed method, a novel real time data set consisting of assessment indicators for the Bundesbank is generated to re-investigate its monetary policy. The analysis provides evidence that (i) the Bundesbank was a flexible monetary targeter and (ii) that the proposed indicator variables contain information beyond that of standard macroeconomic variables used in monetary policy analysis.

Boivin and Giannoni (2006) and Kryshko (2011) combine a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a DFM as a data-rich DSGE model, in which model variables are regarded as common factors derived from large data sets. Following Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007), we estimate a new Keynesian DSGE model for Japan between 1981Q1 and 1995Q4 in a data-rich environment with 55 macroeconomic indicators using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Using a simulation smoother developed by de Jong and Shephard (1995), unlike previous studies, we succeeded in sampling model variables and exogenous shocks used for analyzing sources of business cycles.

Yet as a literature it has paid relatively little attention to public consultation on socio-technical change. Here we set transition management in the context of longstanding debates in science and technology studies, technology assessment and deliberative democracy. Empirically, we use national survey data on Finnish public opinion of state support for future transport options. Showing how transport practices and attitudes to transport innovation policy vary with both demography and geography, we argue that these differences have implications for policy legitimacy. We suggest that, both given and despite the practical difficulties of deliberative democracy, use of participative opinion surveying to better understand social groups with needs and interests that differ from national averages, May help to enhance policy legitimacy and hence the success of transition management.

Meanwhile, the literature suggests that remittances are mainly accessible to middle and upper-income households, rather than to the poorest, thus implying differential capacities amongst households to overcome crises. The present study uses cyclone Evan that hit Samoa in December 2012 as a case study to test this hypothesis. It focuses on the village of Tafitoala and draws on interviews and participatory activities undertaken with the poorest households of the community. It indicates that the poor receive little to no remittances and that they struggled more than the rest of the community to cope with and recover from the cyclone. Their lack of access to remittances had negative consequences on the security and sustainability of their livelihoods. We conclude that remittances reproduce or even increase both inequalities and vulnerabilities existing within the community of origin.","[Le De, L.; Gaillard, J.

This development raises concerns whether the benefits from the extended HSR network would again be limited to the initial HSR corridors and will deepen the inequalities in accessibility with the rising issue of uneven regional development of the country. This paper measures the accessibility of each stage of HSR network extension and evaluates its spatial distribution, variation, and changes using weighted averaged travel time and potential accessibility indicators. The results of this study find different accessibility impacts from each stage of HSR extension. Although travel-time reduction and increased attractions have been widened in more cities by each HSR extension, the spatial equity is degenerated by the extension in 2010/2011 as the improvement of accessibility has been concentrated in cities along the primary HSR corridor near the already-advantageous Seoul capital area. In contrast, the future HSR extension in 2018 will enhance equitable accessibility to the isolated regions such as the northeast and the southwest regions of the country. However, the relative degree of accessibility improvement will not be large enough for increasing the spatial equity of accessibility without more extended HSR networks between provinces.

RFID is an enabling technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, which constitutes a new vision of the Internet as a medium and forum that expands into our everyday lives and connects us virtually to all of the objects that surround us. This paper gives a balanced view of RFID in retailing by showing its current and potential benefits and costs, in particular from the consumer's perspective. The authors also present the findings of a survey that examined the attitudes of Hungarian consumers towards the potential threats of RFID, and conclude that these attitudes are part of a larger psychological construct, which embraces opinions and attitudes towards new information and communications technologies in general. Significant relationships between consumer demography and attitudes towards RFID applications were also revealed. The paper suggests a solution to the privacy problem of current RFID applications, which has been elaborated by researchers of the IoT Research Institute at the Eszterhazy Karoly College in Hungary: if RFID technology were integrated with NFC-enabled mobile phones that included a user interface, consumers would be able to gain control over radio frequency communication.","[Novotny, Adam; David, Loront; Csafor, Hajnalka] Eszterhazy Karoly Coll, Inst Econ Sci, Eger, Hungary",Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University,"Novotny, A (通讯作者)，Eszterhazy Karoly Coll, Inst Econ Sci, Eger, Hungary.",novadam@ektf.hu,"David, Lorant Denes/AAN-4640-2020","Dr. David, Lorant Denes/0000-0001-7880-9860; Novotny, Adam/0000-0001-8638-8947",,,,,50,16,17,0,34,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,615,631,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900008,0

In this context, the selection made by consumers regarding the stores where to purchase from represents a complex decision-making process, conditioned upon the functional and psychological characteristics, among which store atmosphere plays a special part. Moreover, in order to obtain some competitive advantages within an environment that generates specific emotional effects on the buyers, the sellers allocate significant investment resources aimed at implementing some innovative technologies to create store atmosphere. Starting from these considerations, our research aims to identify consumers' perception of the use of innovative technologies in creating store atmosphere. This paper was performed on the basis of an original questionnaire and, for the specialty literature in Romania, it represents the first research elaborated on this subject. The direct research has been conducted by means of a questionnaire-based survey to which 492 persons answered during September-November 2014. The research intended to establish the criteria for stores selection and the role atmosphere plays in this choice, as well as the identification of interest and level of knowledge of some innovative technologies in this field. The research results emphasise the fact that over 75% of respondents have a positive perception on the use of innovative technologies in order to generate a pleasant atmosphere and they are interested in the advantages they bring to the purchasing process.","[Sirbu, Mirela Octavia; Saseanu, Andreea Simona; Ghita, Simona Ioana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Sirbu, MO (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mirela.sirbu@com.ase.ro,"Saseanu, Andreea/AAL-1437-2021; Ghita, Simona Ioana/HFZ-8034-2022","Ghita, Simona Ioana/0000-0002-5634-8570; Saseanu, Andreea Simona/0000-0002-8553-6191",,,,,22,5,6,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,567,582,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900005,0

If the bondholders are not fully coordinated, the shareholders can make the exchange offer unfair by issuing the new bond at a price that is lower than the market price. We perform two experiments to isolate (i) the level of information and (ii) the role of the experience of the bondholders in a freeze-out bond exchange offer. In the first experiment, the experience of the participants is a dominant factor compared to access to information. The choice of the symmetric Nash equilibrium, in which every participant accepts the exchange offer, increases with experience. Conversely, in the second experiment, which offers a lower level of experience, the information provided is the dominant factor. In this experiment relative to the first one, the choice of the symmetric Nash equilibria decreases, and the choice of the Pareto superior asymmetric Nash equilibrium, in which two participants reject the exchange offer and the other accepts it, increases.

The key characteristic of PPPs is the outsourcing and 'bundling' of project delivery components (for example, design, build, finance, operate), structured to incentivise the builder-operator to incorporate long-term operating cost considerations in the design and construction phases of a project and reduce coordination costs. This article reviews the benefits and drawbacks of PPPs and the experience to date, focusing in particular on developing economies. Relative to traditional procurement, PPPs are complex, and require governments to anticipate and plan for contingencies and conduct monitoring and enforcement of long-term contracts. We argue that institutional capacity is a key determinant of PPP success and in mitigating potentially welfare-reducing contract renegotiations evident in the Latin American experience.","[Trebilcock, Michael; Rosenstock, Michael] Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON M5S 2C5, Canada",University of Toronto,"Trebilcock, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Fac Law, 84 Queens Pk, Toronto, ON M5S 2C5, Canada.",michael.trebilcock@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,78,58,68,1,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

I explore the relations between agrarian change and social change, drawing on a monographic study carried out in Cotopaxi Province, in the central sierra of Ecuador, from the 1960s to the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the first part, I emphasized how the transformations unleashed by the crisis of the hacienda regime marked a rupture that consolidated the dense organizational scaffolding in the rural milieu. In this second part, I examine how development agencies, especially non-governmental organizations (NGOs), played a fundamental role in strengthening those structures (1980s and 1990s). The history of the Union of Peasant Organizations of Northern Cotopaxi (UNOCANC) is one such example: born from the struggle for haciendas, inputs from the development apparatus enabled the rise of local elites who turned the organization into one of the most militant in the country. In this paper, I draw attention to aspects seldom mentioned in the specialized bibliography, namely a detailed study of how peasant differentiation, the origins of which lay in hacienda hierarchies, and which was upheld in turn by the agrarian distribution, was accelerated by the actions of NGOs, which continued to favour those indigenous peasants with more power and economic resources. Thus, divergences were consolidated and internal fissures opened up in organizations that are at the root of the crisis of representation experienced by ethnic platforms in the Ecuadorian Andes today.","[Breton Solo De Zaldivar, Victor] Univ Lleida, Dept Art Hist & Social Hist, Lleida, Spain; [Breton Solo De Zaldivar, Victor] Latin Amer Social Sci Fac FLACSO, Dept Anthropol Hist & Humanities, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"De Zaldívar, VBS (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Art Hist & Social Hist, Lleida, Spain.",breton@hahs.udl.cat,,,Spain's Ministry of the Economy and Competiveness [CSO2011-23521],Spain's Ministry of the Economy and Competiveness,"Victor Breton Solo de Zaldivar, Department of Art History and Social History, University of Lleida, Spain; and Department of Anthropology, History and Humanities, Latin American Social Sciences Faculty (FLACSO), Ecuador campus.

The German system of separation of infringement and invalidity decisions provides patent holders with a window of opportunity to enforce patents that may later be invalidated. This shifts a major share of the risk to the defendant, allocating bargaining power to the plaintiff. This study empirically provides support for this incongruity by analyzing how patent litigation outcome in Germany affects the financial performance of the disputing firms. I show that plaintiffs on average profit from litigation while defendants agreeing upon a settlement deal lose as much as defendants losing in trial. I further show that small and unexperienced firms, particularly defendants, are at a disadvantage when dealing with litigation. The results stress that, as long as patent validity cannot entirely be established prior to the infringement proceedings, defendants, and particularly small defendants, will be disadvantaged by a separation of infringement and nullity proceedings.","Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Schliessler, PM (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",schliessler@zew.de,,,Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); Thyssen Foundation,Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); Thyssen Foundation,I am grateful for the funding of this research project by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK) and by the Thyssen Foundation.,,41,17,18,5,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Moreover, firms appear to use the proceeds from the reduction in payout to maintain cash levels and to fund investment. These findings are consistent with the view that a shock to the supply of credit (net of demand effects) during the financial crisis increased the marginal benefit of cash retention, leading some firms to turn to payout reductions as a substitute form of financing.

A number of studies have been carried out to understand the success factors underpinning the US shale gas revolution and how this success could be replicated in Europe. Most of these studies focus on the macroeconomic and energy market impact of a possible shale gas production in Europe. These studies are in general sceptical about the prospects of shale gas development relative to other gas supply options to Europe. By considering the other options available in greater detail and exploring the stochastic nature of shale gas exploration and production as they apply to production economics, we conclude that this scepticism may be overstated. Apart from political opposition that has shut down shale gas exploration in a number of European member states because of concerns over environmental risks, in some countries notably the UK, the combination of political support and a large, liberalised gas market may offer at least a plausible case for shale gas production. To properly assess the potential for shale gas though, a more rigorous, probabilistic analysis of the associated production economics will need to be carried out.","[Chyong, Chi Kong; Reiner, David M.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Chyong, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",k.chyong@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Reiner, David/AAR-7816-2021","Reiner, David/0000-0003-2004-8696",,,,,69,3,3,1,34,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

This distinction is crucial, as entrants are generally smaller than incumbents, but both high entry rates and high firm growth are associated with better economic performance. This paper fills this gap, finding that judicial efficacy fosters the growth of incumbents and promotes entry in Spain. The paper also shows for the first time that the specific type of judicial procedure that companies face in case of a conflict, rather than the overall functioning of courts, is the relevant matter. Specifically, judicial efficacy at the declaratory stage (when a debt is verified by a judge) has a positive impact on both firm growth and entry, while it has no impact at the execution stage (when the judge requires its payment).","[Garcia-Posada, Miguel; Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S.] Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"García-Posada, M (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",miguel.garcia-posada@bde.es; juans.mora@bde.es,"Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./AAK-2001-2021","Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./0000-0003-0964-784X",,,,,48,18,19,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

An open question remains whether participants would consider an additional source of funding, such as public or federal support. We examine the impact of federal funding availability on the marginal utility of management attributes and on respondents' private willingness to pay (WTP) for watershed management plans. Our results suggest that availability of public funding does not significantly alter the preferred tradeoffs among management attributes for active management plans, but alters the utility difference, and therefore the WTP, between an active plan and the status quo alternative. A latent class model further suggests that classes with relatively similar preferences may nonetheless show heterogeneity in how availability of public funds affects WTP for management plans against the status quo, depending on individuals' sociodemographic profiles and environmental attitudes. Public funding affects WTP through both crowding-in and crowding-out effects. Our results suggest that private responses to public funds may be more complex than previous studies on public goods have suggested, as public funds may neither attract contributions nor crowd out private support uniformly.","[Kafle, Achyut] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ ENRE, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Smith, Elizabeth C.] Nat Conservancy Long Isl, Harbor, NY 11724 USA",University of Rhode Island; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; Nature Conservancy,"Kafle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ ENRE, 1 Green House Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",achyut.kafle@gmail.com; stephen.swallow@uconn.edu; lizcsmith@gmail.com,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Rhode Island; DelFavero Faculty Fellowship at University of Connecticut; UConn-Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station,U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Rhode Island; DelFavero Faculty Fellowship at University of Connecticut; UConn-Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided partial funding, with additional funding from the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Rhode Island, the DelFavero Faculty Fellowship at University of Connecticut, and the UConn-Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station.

Using a Baron-Ferejohn protocol, our main interest is in the extent of costly delay (number of bargaining rounds needed to reach agreement). We investigate the effects of group size on delay under both majority and unanimity rule. Under both decision rules, we find that proposals more often fail in larger groups, leading to increased delay. Consistent with prior research, we also find that unanimity rule leads to more delay than does majority rule, in both small and large groups. Contrary to one of our initial hypotheses, we find that the latter effect is not more pronounced in larger groups. The higher rate of failure in larger groups and under unanimity rule is driven by a-combination of three factors: (1) a larger number of individuals must agree, (2) an important fraction of individuals reject offers below the equal share, and (3) proposers demand more (relative to the equal share) in large groups.

Community facilities districts (CFDs) in California are but one example. These districts are financed by issuing a special type of land-secured municipal bonds known as CFD or Mello-Roos bonds, and levying special taxes to service the debt. Using a unique comprehensive data set on California CFD bond issues since the moment of their inception until 2006, we study the default experience of these largely nonrated bonds. Contrary to the general belief that the dirt CFD bonds are very risky, we find that their lifetime performance is at least as good as that of Standard and Poor's B to BBB rated municipal bonds. Using duration analysis, we explore the dependence of the likelihood of CFD default on issue characteristics and macroeconomic and industry factors. We find that the state of local economy and construction industry are strong predictors of CFD default. The default is positively linked to the risk premium of the CFD bonds measured as the spread between their interest rate and the AAA rated general obligation municipal bonds yield index. We also find aging effects and relate them to stages of CFD development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Even though entrepreneurship does not equate to the small and medium-sized enterprises, there is strong support in literature regarding the importance of SMEs in national economies due to the authorities' potential of intervention and their contribution to gross value added. The fluctuating evolution of the Romanian business environment has led to a high volatility of its contribution to GDP, which is especially true in the case of SMEs due to their lack of technology and capital and difficult access to financing, as well as limited know-how compared to the large companies that control the Romanian market. Successful entrepreneurial initiative leads to sustainable businesses and ensures a smooth transition from business ideas to the creation of value added, thus supporting economic growth and the narrowing of macroeconomic gaps which have been generated during the economic recession. As a distinctive and dynamic component of Romanian entrepreneurship, the SME segment has a significant contribution to GDP. This study aims at assessing the contribution of entrepreneurship, through its SME segment, to Romania's GDP in the main economic sectors and, at the same time, the estimation of output gap at sectoral level, thus filling a gap in entrepreneurship-related domestic literature.","[Armeanu, Dan; Istudor, Nicolae; Lache, Leonard] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Armeanu, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",darmeanu@yahoo.com,"Istudor, Nicolae/AAW-2872-2020","Istudor, Nicolae/0000-0002-4581-4548",,,,,29,18,18,0,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,195,211,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800013,0

The research integrates a quantitative study having as major purpose the investigation of the manner in which business coaching contributes to corporation growth in start-up firms and developing companies. The primary objective of the research is to quantitatively determine the effects enhanced by business coaching on company performance and growth of organisational incomes. SME growth and coaching impact are studied through inter-relationships between distinctive company characteristics (such as: industry category, company maturity, number of employees), entrepreneur features (among which can be mentioned: leader age, nominal gender, studies), and entrepreneur character (for instance: locus of control at work, self-efficacy in the work place). The comparison is made between two types of entrepreneurs: the ones who have received business coaching previously with entrepreneurs with no prior business coaching experience, except the one after which research is performed. The research concludes that business coaching has a great impact on the development of entrepreneurs' locus of control and self-efficacy, these leading to organisational growth.","[Dobrea, Mihaela; Maiorescu, Irina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dobrea, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaeladobrea1@yahoo.com,"MIHAELA, BUCUR/T-4541-2018; Maiorescu, Irina/IQS-6944-2023; Maiorescu, Irina/C-4852-2012","MIHAELA, BUCUR/0000-0003-0867-2971; Maiorescu, Irina/0000-0003-1472-5136","European Social Fund, through the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund, through the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund, through the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific interdisciplinary research, doctoral and postdoctoral, in the economic, social and medical fields - EXCELIS, coordinator The Bucharest University of Economic Studies",,24,11,14,1,59,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,247,260,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800016,0

Thus, this study examines the behavior of banks' retail customers regarding non-maturing deposits. Our unique sample comprises the contract and cash flow data for 2.2 million individual contracts from 1991 to 2010. We find that contractual rewards, i.e., qualified interest payments, and government subsidies, effectively stabilize saving behavior and thus bank funding. The probability of an early deposit withdrawal decreases by approximately 40%, and cash flow volatility drops by about 25%. Our findings provide important insights for banks using pricing incentives to steer desired saving patterns for their non-maturing deposit portfolios. Finally, these results are informative regarding the bank liquidity regulations (Basel III) concerning the stability of deposits and the minimum requirements for risk management (European Commission DIRECTIVE 2006/48/EC).

Since 1914, the Panama Canal has provided ships with a direct interoceanic canal for crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The geographical advantage of the Panama Canal allows it to enjoy an exclusive position in international seaborne trade. Passage demand through the canal has increased continuously since its opening, with about 12,000 vessels travelling through it in 2013. However, the Panama Canal's monopoly in interoceanic canal operations may soon come to an end. In 2012, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Nicaraguan Government and a Chinese investor to construct the Nicaragua Canal, which will be built about 400 nautical miles from the Panama Canal. It is expected that the Nicaragua Canal will be operational by 2020. The proposed canal will not only provide an alternative route for vessels to pass between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but will also trigger dynamic changes in seaborne trade patterns. To assess the long-term benefits of the proposed canal, we use a scenario planning method in this study to provide a framework for constructing several scenarios for 2030, 10 years after the anticipated construction of the canal. To develop the scenarios, we consider three macroscale drivers, namely politics, economics, and environment, and the causal relationships between them. Combinations of pairs of drivers are used to generate dominant scenarios to anticipate the role of the Nicaragua Canal with respect to future international trade. The analysis presented in this study will provide transport geographers and other major stakeholders with alternative mindsets into the future spatial changes in and development of maritime transport.

If in companies TQM implementation follows an already known protocol, in SMEs there are some specific implementation issues arising on the one hand because their organizational structure is simplified and therefore the staff is assigned multiple tasks, and on the other hand, the steps in the implementation of TQM are much simplified, the company registering a reduction or at best, an aggregation of functions.

The main question is whether such dealings are parallel with law. The most important is to know how to use, deal and control pesticides in a lawful manner in order to ensure they are protected from the adverse effects. To date, many commercial farms take the easy way out by using the pesticides and fertilizer in excess to be able to quickly eliminate the pests. Even though it can increase the productivity of the crops but at the same time, it will have an impact on health. Application of agrochemicals has vast effects on human being, ground water, soil, conservation of ecosystem and to the nature at large. Mismanagement of agriculture chemicals may cause ruin. There are several legislations governing these issues in Malaysia such as Pesticides Act 1974, Poison Act 1952, Food Act 1983, Environmental Quality Act 1974, Occupational Safety and Healthy Act 1994, Fumigation of Hydrogen Cyanide Act 1953 and many regulations and guidelines.

Dunning's paradigm is an internationalization theory that relates to the advantages of ownership, location and internalization in lodging industry. Although the paradigm has been used in many service sector studies in international literature, there is still a lack of information about Turkish lodging industry. In accordance with the purpose of fill this gap, a questionnaire was conducted from international lodging enterprises in Mugla, the third destination of Turkey hosting the highest number of tourist. The results of the study are compared with the findings of previous researches. The findings obtained tend to confirm the applicability of the eclectic theory of foreign direct investment to lodging industry.

The objective of this paper is to assess potential risks of catastrophe and obtain insights into efficient and practical allocations of risk in a PP insurance system, which is based on the financial capacity of public and private sectors and their interests focus. PP insurance system concerns how catastrophe risks should be shared between different public and private stakeholders, including the insured, the insurer and the government. In this arrangement of risk allocation, insured and private insurers are the first and the second layer respectively. In deciding on the amounts of coverage to purchase, they minimize their costs (premiums to be paid) with respect to a constraint on the amount of risk that they are willing to carry themselves, namely deductible and stop-loss for, respectively, the insured and the insurer. Government is taken as the third layer in the PP insurance scheme, and functions as a last resort for catastrophe damage in a PP insurance system. To determine retention level mentioned above, a approach that deviates from the eLpected utility theory and optimizes the insured's and the insurers' final wealth is introduced. In that model, they can be obtained by minimizing the coverage function, which meets the corresponding 99.9% tail value at risk (TVaR) constraint for flood damage. The main innovation point of this paper is that it tries to obtain insights into efficient and practical allocations of risk in a PP insurance system according circumstance, and focuses on the design of optimal insurance policies to make risk allocation across multilayer under tail value at risk TVaR loss constraints.","[Bao Weiwei] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Dongfang Coll, Haining 314408, Peoples R China; [Zhang Daijun] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, DJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",1021216270@qq.com; zdj0303@126.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,193,204,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500014,0

Then, we develop a linear regression model for evaluating the effects of local financial autonomy on local economic growth and apply it for the case of Romanian counties, over the period 2006-2012, period broadly corresponding to Romania's membership to the European Union and covering both pre-crisis and crisis conditions. To control for heterogeneity, we use the fixed effects estimation technique for panel data models. The results did not confirm our hypothesis of a positive impact of a higher degree of local financial autonomy on local economic growth but, as some other studies on developing countries found, proved that financial autonomy had deleterious effects on local economic growth at the level of Romanian counties.

Specifically, the literature examines only how retirement may affect the health insurance available to the potential retiree but not how it might affect a spouse's options. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, I find that the impact a husband's retirement might have on a wife's health insurance options has a statistically significant impact on a husband's rate of retirement that is independent of considerations of his own health insurance options. In households where the wife is the only one at risk of losing affordable health insurance if the husband retires, the husband is 30% less likely to retire than if neither spouse is at risk (a 5 percentage point decrease in the retirement rate). Based on these findings, prior research is missing one avenue that changes to the Medicare eligibility age and health insurance policy changes through the Affordable Care Act might impact the labor supply of older workers.

The primary value of relative distribution of the burden of the seller and buyer are further adjusted for values suggesting that the increase in the tax burden may result in reduction of the sales prices. Furthermore in this text there is realized the conservative approach for determining the minimum values of the shift of the tax burden on the consumers in the form of a strict determination of limits of the distribution of the burden only within the limits amount of the actual tax burden. Identification of the partial shift of the increased tax burden on consumers in the minimum amount of 1/3 is an important result of the carried investigation.

The economic value of the public investment in the trials remains unknown. This study uses experimental yields spanning 1977 - 2012 to attribute the influence of the national maize cultivar trials to maize yield improvement on farmer localities in the Highveld region of South Africa. Using attribution methods, the study estimates that 24.3kg per hectare of extra maize yields accrued to commercial maize producers because of the national maize trials. The economic value of these investments was found to be R1.4billion (in 2012 currency values).

Considering these elements the current paper focuses on combining specific financial and accounting valuation techniques with location analysis techniques for a better assessment of the values for the commercial real estate properties. While the financial and accounting techniques use methods of calculation established according to the International Valuation Standards, on the other hand this task can be highly simplified if it uses land property management systems or information systems such as the GIS (Geographical Information System). The main function of the land property assessment system, is to define the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the property in order to assess the market price while the main function of GIS based systems is to use economic and cadastral information in coordination with other elements such as: physical factors, social factors, taxation, infrastructure, pollution and noise, economic factors and legal factors in order to facilitate a good assessment of the value of an industrial property. The paper analyzed both the economic factors: based on the International Valuation Standards and also the locational factors of a property valuation and identified the common factors which are used in both methods and which can provide excellent solutions in property valuation.

Our main findings suggest that banks shifted risk to non-depository creditors. As regards banking policy, the analysis indicates that (i) the three pillars of Basel II do not seem to be effective in controlling risk shifting incentives, (ii) generous deposit insurance schemes seem to incentivize risk shifting, and (iii) in tune with the new rules on conservation buffers in Basel III, incentives to shift risk seem to be weaker in banks with a capital buffer.

Workers are risk averse and face the possibility of unemployment. Firms are risk neutral and face random shocks to productivity. Workers can participate in a shadow economy, or informal sector. The model yields several lessons. First, countries should encourage formal employment to address the issue of informal employment. In extreme cases, such encouragement translates into high severance payments and negative payroll taxes. Along these same lines, unemployment payments cannot be too large. In fact, when the risk of informality is extreme, the authors find that unemployment benefits should be negative, which is (in effect) a positive tax on the lack of formal employment.","[Espino, Emilio] Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sanchez, Juan M.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Espino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,"Sanchez, Juan/I-5752-2016","Sanchez, Juan/0000-0003-0048-9128",,,,,7,2,2,0,11,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Spreads do not change, however. Stocks from a pan-European control sample show no such liquidity changes. Thus, the Italian OTR fee had the effect of making Italian stocks markets more shallow and less resilient. Large stocks are more severely affected than midcaps. We also find evidence of a limited decrease in turnover. Consolidated liquidity, constructed by aggregating across all electronic trading venues for these stocks, decreases just like that on the main exchange.

This provision of public goods is generally accepted as a justification for public intervention in a market economy. Ever since the reform in 1985, Common Agricultural Policy has been targeted to enhance the provision of public goods. A recent CAP reform introduced the Green Direct Payment - a new policy instrument in Pillar 1 - which remunerates farmers for the provision of environmental public goods. However, there are also instruments in Pillar II that support the provision of environmental goods, including social public goods. The paper addresses these issues and focuses on public goods provided by Czech agriculture. The research question is focused on the possibility of economically valuating all these goods together using one valuation method. The research questions will be answered by designating public goods in agriculture and specifying the most used method of their valuation. A precise literature survey will be conducted, previous studies and scientific publications will be compared, and the results of ecological, biological and economic research will be linked. The final state of art will be used as a basis for calculating a level of subsidy that covers the production of agricultural public goods.","[Halova, Pavlina; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova; Havlikova, Michaela; Cechura, Lukas; Maly, Michal] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hálová, P (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",halova@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Halova, Pavlina/H-6831-2018; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018; Havlikova, Michaela/H-5272-2018","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Halova, Pavlina/0000-0003-2236-3227; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874; Havlikova, Michaela/0000-0002-2694-3862",,,,,100,6,6,0,21,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,145,158,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600015,0

By applying the panel unit root test of Pesaran (2007) to real exchange rate data of eleven euro countries for the sample period of January 1957 to May 2013, we find that, contrary to the above intuition, the evidence for the mean-reverting in real exchange rates is much weaker in the post-1998 euro period than in the pre-euro period. In contrast, we find that for the four countries not using the euro: Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK, the evidence for the mean-reverting in real exchange rates is strong in both the pre- and post-euro (post-1998) periods. Moreover, through our panel estimation of the error correction model using the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators a la Pesaran (2006), we find that the flexibility of nominal exchange rates is crucial for the adjustment of real exchange rates to PPP.

For that purpose, the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) has been developed, which does not show the list of countries attractive for the tourists, but stands for the index for the measuring of factors which contribute to the travel and tourism development. On the basis of this index, this paper analyses the travel and tourism competitiveness, in relation to the countries in the South-Eastern Europe. According to the last TTCI report of the World Economic Forum, in 2013, Serbia occupied the unenviable 89th place. The subject of this article is the travel and tourism competitiveness recognition in Serbia, on the basis of health and hygiene as one of the TTCI pillars.

Meanwhile, a competition environment of fair play, an active patent and technology trading market and diversified intermediary market should be available to ensure a sound external environment.","Chinese Acad Sci & Technol Dev, Inst Investment, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Li, XX (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci & Technol Dev, Inst Investment, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-146-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,172,180,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364787100030,0

Then we use the panel data of 158 countries within continued 27 years to examine the key predictions from our model. Theoretical and empirical analysis both show an increase in the degree of particularism in the incumbent government has a negative effect on trade policy.

Data, obtained from Bloomberg database, cover issuances from 2002 to 2011. Using some tests for statistical significant differences it has been shown that the economic crisis had a considerable impact on the convertible bonds issued by the American nonfinancial companies. Average time to maturity, time to conversion and conversion premium decreased after 2008. Higher conversion ratio and lower interest paid has been also observed.

This is the reason why startups are not suitable applicant for bank loan. For small businesses it is common to get a loan from bank, but for startups it is not an option and also it is a great risk for founders because they dont have guarantee that their idea will work and will make money for them. That is why, startups need to find new, special way of funding. As startups are growing in Slovakia, different financing possibilities are developing as well. The are some options how startups can get finances in single lifecycle stages. This paper describes possibilities which startups can use in each of their lifecycle phases.

They can serve as hedging against risk instrument. Inside debt is a source of financial risk. The debt is higher the risk is higher. We expect that inside debt levels should be in correspondence with cash levels. In case of firms without full operating cycle, level of operational risk is smaller than in forms with full operating cycle and levels of cash plays much more the role of the buffer that hedge against the operational risk.

The contribution of our paper lies in the decomposition of income inequality by groups of households based on socio-economic characteristics and the estimation of between and within group inequality.

Going beyond a theoretic review of these methods and based on the assumption that time series analyses are the best balanced alternative from the perspective of accuracy (benefits) and resource usage (costs), the paper will inquire which technique can be used in order to estimate the levels of local revenue collection in Romania. As such, three time-series analyses, namely the Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Smoothing (EXS) and Transformation Moving Average (TMA) are used to create estimates for 2011 based on revenue collection levels of 3228 Romanian territorial - administrative units for the 2008-2010 periods. In order to identify which of the three best fits the data, the estimates made with SMA, EXS and TMA were compared (in SPSS using the Paired sample T Test) with the actual 2011 data. Since the difference between the TMA estimates and the actual data are the only ones that are not statistically significant, the paper argues that the TMA is the best fitted time series techniques for this particular type of data. Furthermore, in order to assess the accuracy of the TMA as a medium term forecasting technique, revenue collection levels will be analyzed according to the type of community for both for the actual 2008-2011 data and a predicted (2012-2015) period.

This review covers the history of capital structure theories, including the trade-off and pecking-order theories, and takes a skeptical view of how those theories have been tested so far. I give roughly equal space to normative, practical applications, including adjusted present value (APV), the valuation of real options, and the application of modern finance to regulation, insurance, the valuation of R&D, and the role of risk capital in financial institutions.

As important as, this resource is to the quest for economic transformation and diversification of the Ghanaian economy, its usage should also take into consideration challenges of depletion. This is so relevant given the fact that, the country needs to make plans that will cover the future generations. The study employed Hubbert's linearization model and curves of oil production and depletion. Two models were set up. The first including few years of the exploratory activities and the second making use of only the years of actual oil production. The chosen results predicted that Ghana had a total recoverable oil reserves of about 1.8 billion barrels. It also predicted that the maximum or peak production will occur in the year 2025 and total oil will be depleted by 2045.

Both new Forest Code and the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) aim to stop forest mafia through changes of principle operating system. The new Forest Code disengages the transport activity from the exploitation of the wood, leading to the elimination of tax evasion (grey market) in which retailers was active. Under EUTR, is prohibited the placing on the EU market of illegally harvested timber and derived products. The Regulation applies to wood and wood products first placed on the EU market. This counters the timber trade and illegally harvested timber products requiring key obligations discussed in these article. It was also performed a comparative analysis of the old Romanian Forest Code of 2008 with a proposal for a new Forest Code in April 2014, whose changes can lead to stopping illegal logging and more effective control of the quantities transported and processed wood. A forest policy accepted by all national political entities is the expansion of forest through planting of degraded land to achieve in a period of 20 years, the European average in terms of area covered by forests. This objective is achievable through considerable financial efforts. Trends, conclusions and proposals are improving Romanian and European legislation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The restructuring process of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in Romania started in 1993 with a massive exercise that included more than 400 SOE (state-owned-companies) amid on the following patterns: top-down approach and a pre-privatization restructuring preceded and joined by a substantial specific legislative framework. This first wave has been followed by a second wave starting from 2001 that included a limited number of companies but of higher value and impact on the economy (biggest banks, big industrial and energy companies, former regies autonomes etc.) The second wave of restructuring meant a change of paradigm for companies in need of restructuring, developed in two important stages, when SOE were listed at the stock exchange, privatized or placed in a stand-by process in order to be restructured. Thus, the methodology of restructuring in the second wave has been retooled and correlated with the evolution of the macroeconomic conditions and agreements with IFI's. The EBRD index of privatization show a direct relation between the two waves, as Romania received a higher value for this index as it moved to next level of restructuring and privatization.

In contrast, the conducted print media analysis on the German biofuel discourse for the period from 1995 to 2012 only found a marginal role of scientific actors in the debate. Even though support for biofuels has been largely rejected as inefficient by several scientific brain trusts for many years, the German government, as well as the EU adhere to this policy. This raises the question of the underlying interests that drive the persistent support for biofuels. In this context, the paper investigates the standing and positioning of different actors in the public media and thereby it contributes to a better understanding of why the political support for biofuels is continued, despite the doubts of scientists. One of the core findings of the study states, that one reason for this political support can be seen in the dominance of a coalition of biofuel advocates, mainly formed by political and economic actors, in the public discourse.","[Puttkammer, Judith; Grethe, Harald] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Puttkammer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Fachgebiet Agrar & Ernahrungspolit, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",j.puttkammer@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Puttkammer, Judith/0000-0002-1471-3365",,,,,44,14,14,1,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Correctly identifying the economic activities exposed to the risk of carbon leakage represents the first step in mitigating the risk effectively. This paper assesses the robustness of the quantitative assessment criteria used by the European Commission for Phase 3. For example we apply the criteria to data for UK and Germany and compare the results with the Commissions' assessment conducted at the aggregated EU level. This reveals that sectors' exposure risk to carbon leakage can vary across different Member States due to differences in production processes, technologies and fuel mix; process emissions; recycling rate differences; product mix differences; sector classification, statistical boundaries, activity allocation differences; and finally difference in data quality. Overall, we find that relative carbon intensity of sectors, measured as cost increase relative to gross value added, provides a robust metric. The analysis also highlights the importance of using high quality and disaggregated data for this assessment.","[Sato, Misato] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Neuhoff, Karsten] DIW, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Neuhoff, Karsten] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Graichen, Verena; Schumacher, Katja; Matthes, Felix] Oko Inst eV, Inst Appl Ecol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Sato, M (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.sato1@lse.ac.uk,,"Sato, Misato/0000-0002-9978-9595",ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,30,30,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The market analysis for printed publications suggests that employing high inputs for print, delivery, storage and distribution followed by high number of copies delivered to the final consumer is ineffective. Implementation of Print on-demand technology allows you to print single book up to 200 copies. Correct use of digital printing and binding equipment effectively addresses the economics of this process as well. Process of storing the books is ignored as the number of printed copies is directly related to the number of orders. Publishing house owning the printed version of pdf publication chooses the file from the database and sends it to printing company with on-demand printer.

An example of such a trend is evident in the Commonwealth of Independent States. A special position of agriculture is the main reason for limited trade cooperation among the countries. None of the countries want to lose its self-sufficiency and control over its agriculture and foodstuff market. During the nineties, former Soviet Union countries lost a significant portion of their agriculture and foodstuff production capacities. The result was a significant reduction in export and massive growth of imports. The low level of self-sufficiency as well as the increasing negative agricultural trade balance were a stimulus for the government to reconsider their policies related to agricultural market development. The objective of this paper is to identify the main changes and trends related to agricultural market development. The paper focuses on changes related to agricultural trade value development realised by the CIS countries. The agricultural trade is analysed using the Lafay index. The whole analysis is conducted according to the harmonised system (SITC 3 rev.) in current USD. The results show that the agriculture and foodstuff production capacity of Russia and all the CIS countries has increased over the last decade; self-sufficiency is improving especially at CIS level. Individual countries encourage their mutual cooperation - they have already established an entity similar to a free-trade zone and in the future they would like to establish a custom union or common market. The level of protection of their market is increasing - especially in the Russian Federation. An effort to provide enough space for growth of domestic production capacities is especially visible with respect to the applied ban on selected foodstuff imports.","[Smutka, Lubos; Benesova, Irena] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Laputkova, Adriana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz; benesova@pef.czu.cz; laputkova@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Benesova, Irena/B-3942-2011; Laputkova, Adriana/L-7824-2017; Laputkova, Adriana/AAV-7801-2020","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Laputkova, Adriana/0000-0001-6483-9081; Laputkova, Adriana/0000-0001-6483-9081",,,,,25,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,376,384,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600042,0

A knowledge sharing culture facilitates communication and information exchange, problem solving, team working and decision making. General competencies embrace abilities such as prioritizing, learning new things, coming-up with new ideas and solutions, working productively with others. The discussion arises primarily based on the considerable theoretical vagueness and empirical inconclusiveness in the existing literature concerning knowledge management mechanisms and their contribution. As of interest to resolve this controversy, a research framework is developed in which general competencies act as the mediator between knowledge sharing culture and employees' satisfaction in accounting offices. The empirical findings from a survey of 84 employees in accounting offices in Central Greece confirmed that general competencies exert a mediating effect on the relationship between knowledge sharing culture and job satisfaction.

These items could be defined as the core elements of patriotism, thus they are able to induce strong ethnocentric behavior. Our aim was to differentiate the emotional attitudes by gender. To achieve that, we have designed an online survey in order to get a basic understanding about the young people's attitude toward the hungarikums and the gender differences in this age group. We have found that the hungarikums are known in this age group, but most of them has a really small spontaneous awareness. Based on the opinion of the respondents the most typical hungarikum is the schnapps ('palinka'), and the Ilcsi natural cosmetics are the less typical to our country. By analyzing the gender differences with using ANOVA method we could conclude that the evaluation of the females are significantly higher in eight cases. Based on this evaluation we grouped the hungarikums with using the MDS method, and our results show that there are also some differences between the males and females. This study is the first step of a complex neuromarketing study, where we examined the visual representation of the hungarikums in an fMRI machine. Further extension of the research project is to check the attention and interest with the usage of an eye tracking device.","[Varga, Akos] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Business Adm, Dept Media Mkt Commun & Telecommun, 8 Fovam Ter, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Kemeny, Ildiko] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Business Adm, Dept Market Res & Consumer Behav, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Corvinus University Budapest,"Varga, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Business Adm, Dept Media Mkt Commun & Telecommun, 8 Fovam Ter, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",akos.varga2@uni-corvinus.hu; ildiko.kemeny@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,967,976,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000105,0

Thanks to the proceeding public finance reform the long-term assets data are prepared under the accrual basis from 2011 in the whole Czech public sector. Moreover these data are revealed to external users obligatorily which both increase their information capability and transparency. On the other hand preliminary findings suggest that these data still are not used for decision making purposes sufficiently. The main aim of the paper is to summarize findings concerning the long-term assets reporting in the Czech state administration entities and to determine some developmental trends and coherences.

The stated facts also have a positive effect on the competitiveness of the national economy of the Czech Republic. Foreign direct investment inflows are significantly reflected in the creation of sources of revenue for public budgets in the Czech Republic. For this reason, the research team is dedicated to the design and improvement of methodological approaches to measuring the effectiveness of fiscal investment incentives and their verification in the environment in major corporations, investment incentive recipients.

Court interpretation states that if a company has got two unpaid in time invoices it should file for bankruptcy (however, under certain circumstances the judge can dismiss the case). Most practitioners do not follow this interpretation and wait much longer before they file for bankruptcy. Consequently, if a company finally goes bankrupt the managers are charged with negligence for waiting too long with starting bankruptcy proceedings. The paper presents data for 100 randomly chosen companies from the Lesser Poland (Malopolska) region to show that having 2 unpaid in time invoices is very common in Poland and such companies do not file for bankruptcy (even if they should). The paper ends with a proposal of the policy changes where filing for bankruptcy based on cash flow insolvency requires additional conditions such as certain minimum amount of delayed debt or the number of debtors whom a company failed to pay back obligations in time.","[Wyrobek, Joanna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Wyrobek, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",wyrobekj@uek.krakow.pl,"Wyrobek, Joanna/ABG-8806-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,686,695,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200090,0

While some individuals react by holding back on their financial and charitable activities following stressful events, others may express more generosity by increasing their giving due to solidarity and empathy with the victims, or out of heightened nationalism and patriotism. Using a longitudinal analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case study to uncover the relations between terrorism and philanthropic behavior, we find that terror attacks increase considerably the scope of giving by individuals and households. Our empirical approach relies on a unique panel dataset of 152,731 tax itemizer philanthropists and terrorism data from 1999 to 2011. The results are statistically significant and robust across a multitude of model specifications. Furthermore, we use an instrumental variable approach to identify a causal link and address potential endogeneity concerns. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to empirically identify and quantify the effect of sequential terror attacks on philanthropy over a relatively long period using detailed micro-level information.","[Berrebi, Claude; Yonah, Hanan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Berrebi, C (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",claude.berrebi@gmail.com; hanan.yonah@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Berrebi, Claude/0000-0002-1350-5062",,,,,58,12,12,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2016,169.0,3-4,,,,,171,194,,10.1007/s11127-016-0375-y,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EA3ML,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386506800002,0

For this purpose, transactional information from a multitude of sources has been collected and cross-checked in order to compile a data set comprising virtually all cat bond tranches that were launched between June1997 and December2012. In order to identify the main determinants of the cat bond spread at issuance, a series of OLS regressions with heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent standard errors is run. Our results confirm the expected loss as the most important factor. Apart from that, covered territory, sponsor, reinsurance cycle, and the spreads on comparably rated corporate bonds exhibit a major impact. Based on these findings, we then propose an econometric cat bond pricing model that is applicable for all territories, perils, and trigger types. It exhibits a robust fit across different calibration subsamples and achieves a higher in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy than several competing specifications that have been introduced in earlier work.","[Braun, Alexander] Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Braun, A (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Insurance Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland.",alexander.braun@unisg.ch,,"Braun, Alexander/0000-0003-1334-0533",Asia-Pacific Risk and Insurance Association; University of St. Gallen,Asia-Pacific Risk and Insurance Association; University of St. Gallen,"Alexander Braun is at the Institute of Insurance Economics of the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.

But these conversations about what are arguably the most significant changes in the distribution of incomes and earnings since the 1940s are leading to very different views on how public policy should respond. This is as true in Canada as it is in almost all of the other rich countries where inequality has risen. In this paper, I tell two stories about inequality one from the perspective of those who feel it is not a problem worth the worry, and the other from the perspective of those who see it as the defining challenge of our time to clarify the issues facing Canadians and what public policy should do about them.","[Corak, Miles] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Corak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,111,12,14,0,13,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

First, is people's quality of life (still) enhanced by national prosperity? Many scholars doubt this, in particular advocates of de-growth. The second question concerns the relationship between the good life and self-reported happiness: Do people chiefly report being happy and satisfied for reasons embodied in achieving a good life? For addressing these issues we draw on a novel quality of life approach, the 'elements of the good life' as sketched out by Skidelsky and Skidelsky in 2013. This approach focuses on life results in seven domains: health, security, friendship, respect, leisure, personality, and harmony with nature. Our article refines the original concept and suggests a way to measure the well-being of individuals with the help of the Good Life Index. By analyzing data for 30 European countries from the most recent European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) within a multilevel framework, we can show that Europeans' life-quality is better in wealthier societies, and that Europeans are authentically happy.

Union elections that create new labor bargaining units lead to higher loan spreads, consistent with creditors requiring compensation when employees gain bargaining power.

In a large-scale experiment, we compare the fairness and efficiency of three unanimity bargaining procedures used to reach a consensus in a three-partner subjective claims problem. Under each procedure partners move sequentially, making alternating proposals. The procedures differ in whether they ask for a complete division proposal (Offer and Exit rule) or only for a proposal regarding the partner's own fair share (Demand rule); and in whether partners have to accept the entire division proposal (Offer and Demand rule) or only their own share (Exit rule). For the fairness assessment partial and impartial fairness views are used and we find that the Offer rule performs best in terms of allocative fairness and no worse in terms of efficiency.

The theoretical results show that publicly constructed physical barriers and mangroves encourage self-protection but discourage self-insurance expenditures. However, public disaster relief and rehabilitation programs lead to the crowding-out of self-protection but the crowding-in of self-insurance. Our empirical analysis of coastal households in Bangladesh impacted by Cyclone Sidr reveals partial support for the crowding-out and crowding-in effects of public investments and programs. Households located in a mangrove-protected area invest more in self-protection and less in self-insurance. Other controls, such as household socio-economic characteristics, also influence and add a degree of complexity to the relationship.","[Mahmud, Sakib] Univ Wisconsin Super, Dept Econ, Erlanson Hall 301,Belknap & Catlin Ave,POB 2000, Superior, WI 54880 USA; [Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Superior; University of Wyoming,"Mahmud, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Super, Dept Econ, Erlanson Hall 301,Belknap & Catlin Ave,POB 2000, Superior, WI 54880 USA.",smahmud@uwsuper.edu; ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Current emphasis on increasing resilience to climate change and reducing agricultural greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions strengthens the support for sustainable agricultural production. In fact, reducing losses in soil fertility, reclaiming degraded lands, and promoting synergistic interaction between crop production and forests are generally seen as good climate change policies. In order for decision-makers to develop long-term policies that address these issues, they must have tools at their disposal that evaluate trade-offs, opportunities, and repercussions of the options considered. In this paper, the authors combine and reconcile the output of three models widely accessible to the public to analyze the impacts of policies that target emission reduction in the agricultural sector. We present an application to Colombia which reveals the importance of considering the full scope of interactions among the various land uses. Results indicate that investments in increasing the efficiency and productivity of the livestock sector and reducing land allocated to pasture are preferable to policies that target deforestation alone or target a reduction of emissions in crop production. Investments in livestock productivity and land-carrying capacity would reduce deforestation and provide sufficient gains in carbon stock to offset greater emissions from increased crop production while generating higher revenues.

This article uses agricultural census data (provided at the country level in Web Appendix) to show that there are more than 570 million farms worldwide, most of which are small and family-operated. It shows that small farms (less than 2 ha) operate about 12% and family farms about 75% of the world's agricultural land. It shows that average farm size decreased in most low- and lower-middle income countries for which data are available from 1960 to 2000, whereas average farm sizes increased from 1960 to 2000 in some upper middle-income countries and in nearly all high-income countries for which we have information. Such estimates help inform agricultural development strategies, although the estimates are limited by the data available. Continued efforts to enhance the collection and dissemination of up-to date, comprehensive, and more standardized agricultural census data, including at the farm and national level, are essential to having a more representative picture of the number of farms, small farms, and family farms as well as changes in farm size and farmland distribution worldwide.

The transmission can occur through a global banking channel in which global banks intermediate wholesale funding to local banks. Changes in financial conditions are passed across borders through the banks' balance-sheet exposure to credit, currency, maturity, and funding risks resulting in house price spillovers. While controlling for country-level and global factors, we find significant co-movement across housing markets of countries with proportionally high bank integration. Bank integration can better capture house price co-movements than other measures of economic integration. Once we account for bank exposure, other spatial linkages traditionally used to account for return co-movements across region such as trade, foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, geographic proximity, etc. - become insignificant. Moreover, we find that the co-movement across housing markets decreases for countries with less developed mortgage markets characterized by fixed mortgage rate contracts, low limits of loan-to-value ratios and no mortgage equity withdrawal.

The challenge, therefore, lies in implementing projects that achieve national or regional development goals while also generating positive social and economic outcomes for displaced populations. This paper uses a longitudinal, mixed-methods design to understand the short-term changes in wealth and subjective well-being of households displaced due to construction of the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian Amazon. The households were compensated by either cash or credit for their lost land and assets, and were then responsible for finding and purchasing new property. Using pre- and post-displacement household survey and semi-structured interview data, as well as data from a small comparison group, I find that wealth increased for the majority of the study population and that socioeconomic inequality decreased, as poorer households experienced greater improvements in housing conditions, assets, and property ownership. In addition, subjective well-being improved for most households, particularly among those who did not own land at baseline, those who gained assets such as vehicles, those who remained closer to the original study area, and those who remained in close proximity to other households from the study population. Moving to an urban destination was strongly associated with declines in well-being, as was moving far from family or friends. These results suggest that investing sufficient resources in a compensation-based resettlement program can benefit households displaced by large infrastructure projects in the short term, but additional data collection is needed after the completion of dam construction to determine whether these benefits are sustained over the longer term.

Using a broad definition of entrepreneurial practices in universities, the aim of this paper was to extend the analysis of entrepreneurial activities to teaching-led universities besides their research-intensive counterparts. Results, based on micro-data on over 22,000 academics in the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities across all higher education institutions in the UK, indicate that the levels and geographical reach of the diverse set of entrepreneurial practices conducted by research-intensive and teaching-led universities differ significantly.

While most land policy prioritizes the economic utility of land, indigenous territorial demands call for governments to more broadly conceptualize the definition and utility of land. Since the 1990s, most Latin American countries have formally recognized a range of indigenous territorial rights and worked to translate these rights into practice. Drawing on the Chilean experience, this paper argues that these alternative conceptualizations of land and territory complicate the implementation of government efforts to recognize indigenous demands. Specifically, the insufficiently defined scope of the policy exacerbates tension between communities' territorial rights demands and the government's capacity to return land. This tension is gradually and bureaucratically resolved, hindering both the policy's ability to meaningfully respond to indigenous territorial demands and the government's objective of promoting rural development. Future discussions and research must consider how these competing conceptualizations of land affect indigenous and land policy.","[Bauer, Kelly] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Monroe Hall 440,2115 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Bauer, K (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Monroe Hall 440,2115 G St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",kbauer2@gwu.edu,,"Bauer, Kelly/0000-0002-6012-8095",,,,,69,22,27,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In the 1990s, Argentina transitioned into a neoliberal agro-industrial model based on producing GM soy for export. Though celebrated as a success, the expansion of GM soy monocultures has brought widespread socio-ecological disruption. Various social actors have started to mobilize against the resulting environmental injustice. I focus on the peasant-indigenous movement in the north of the country, which is struggling for land rights, and the movements against agrochemical spraying in the central Pampas region. These groups, which are relatively powerless to control resources where they live, and that experience little or no benefit from GM soy production, nevertheless bear most of its social and ecological costs. These struggles link environmental and social well-being, becoming struggles for ecological sustainability as well as social justice and equity.","[Leguizamon, Amalia] Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, 1229 Broadway St,220 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Leguizamon, Amalia] Tulane Univ, Stone Ctr Latin Amer Studies, 1229 Broadway St,220 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Leguizamón, A (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Sociol, 1229 Broadway St,220 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.;Leguizamón, A (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Stone Ctr Latin Amer Studies, 1229 Broadway St,220 Newcomb Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",aleguiza@tulane.edu,"Leguizamón, Amalia/AFR-3140-2022","Leguizamón, Amalia/0000-0002-7139-3433",Graduate Center of the City University of New York; Tulane University,Graduate Center of the City University of New York; Tulane University,"I offer many and heartfelt thanks to Gerardo Otero and Pablo Lapegna for inviting me to be part of this conversation and for their editorial help.

After all children are gone, parents upgrade their personal lifestyle to a level approximately that of childless peers, and save only a small proportion of the freed-up resources. Since parents had fewer resources to save while they were young, retirement preparedness among them is a more serious concern than among childless individuals.","[Rottke, Simon; Klos, Alexander] Univ Kiel, Inst Quantitat Business & Econ Res QBER, Kiel, Germany; [Klos, Alexander] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Rottke, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Quantitat Business & Econ Res QBER, Kiel, Germany.",alexander.klos@qber.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,65,4,4,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.
