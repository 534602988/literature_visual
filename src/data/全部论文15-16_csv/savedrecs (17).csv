If labour supply elasticities are large, the burden of financing the model can be large even if, arguably, the practice of providing subsidised goods that support labour supply is likely to mitigate these effects. We utilise repeated cross sections of micro data from several countries, including the four major Nordic countries, available from the Luxembourg Income Study, LIS, to estimate labour supply elasticities, both at the intensive and extensive margins. The data span over four decades and include a large number of tax reform episodes, with tax rate variation arising both from cross-sectional and country-level differences. Using these data, we investigate whether micro and macro estimates differ in a systematic way. The results do not provide strong support for the view that elasticities at the macro level would be higher than the corresponding micro elasticities. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Health tends to have an impact on retirement through morbidity, determining earnings and the disutility of work, and through longevity, determining the need to accumulate retirement wealth. Conversely, the age of retirement drives the demand for health care through the value of survival and the value of morbidity reductions. We characterise the optimal relationship between health expenditure and retirement and apply our model to analyse the effects of moral hazard in the annuity market. While moral hazard always induces excessive health investments and an excessive duration of working life, it also triggers an excessive level of consumption if the impact of health on the disutility of work is sufficiently large. We examine a transfer scheme and mandatory retirement as policies towards curtailing moral hazard. Numerical analysis illustrates the role of moral hazard in shaping the life-cycle allocation.

Yet, traditional international business cycle models predict a much weaker link between trade and business cycle comovement We propose that fluctuations in the number of varieties embedded in trade flows may drive the observed comovement by increasing the correlation among trading partners' aggregate productivity. Our hypothesis is that business cycles should be more strongly correlated between countries that trade a wider variety of goods. We find empirical support for this hypothesis. After decomposing trade into its extensive and intensive margins, we find that the extensive margin explains most of the trade-productivity and trade-output comovement This result is striking because the extensive margin accounts for only a fourth of the variability in total trade. We then develop a two-country model with heterogeneous firms, endogenous entry, and fixed export costs, in which the aggregate productivity correlation increases with trade in varieties. A numerical exercise shows that our proposed mechanism increases business cycle synchronization compared with the levels predicted by traditional models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyses the theoretical foundations and the empirical validity of multi-dimensional technical tools that can be used for well-being measurement. There is no doubt that there is a lot of complexity and fuzziness inherent in multi-dimensional concepts such as well-being. A possible reduction of this complexity, a pre-condition for policy-making, introduces the problem of the descriptors used: indicators and indexes. In a multi-dimensional framework, multi-criteria evaluation is a consistent approach for the construction of so-called composite indicators. Often, some individual indicators improve while others deteriorate. This is the classical conflictual situation dealt with in multi-criteria evaluation; in particular non-compensatory methods are quite relevant, since compensability implies complete substitutability between different types of capital. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can estimate the robustness of the results obtained and help the framing of the debate around the conceptual framework used, that is, which representation of reality (and thus which societal values and interests) has been considered.","Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Munda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,Spanish Government [HAR2010-20689-02-01],Spanish Government(Spanish Government),Comments by the anonymous referees are gratefully acknowledged.

We exploit data from the exams that the Finnish universities that provide education in economics and business use to choose their students. These exams are multiple choice tests where wrong answers are penalized with negative points and omissions yield zero points. This scoring rule means that the number of omitted items will affect the probability of entry. The strategic setting of the applicants varies depending on the university where they are applying to and on the amount of starting points that they are rewarded based on their high school success. The results show that, controlling for starting points, women perform worse than men in the entrance exam and are less likely to gain entry. Women also omit more items in the exam. Using the Rasch Model to derive the predicted probabilities of answering items correctly for each applicant, we show that women deviate more than men from the number of items that would maximize the predicted probability of entry and that they do so because they omit too many items.

Income mobility plays a crucial role in shaping distributive patterns and is closely related to the capacity of a socio-economic system to provide equality of opportunities and the removal of social impediments. In this study we exploit the longitudinal structure of the EU-SILC database to provide a comprehensive overview of intragenerational mobility from 2004 to 2006 across 25 European countries, classified into six capitalistic models. After having descriptively analysed heterogeneity in income dynamics by means of alternative measures, we identify the microeconomic drivers of household income mobility, focusing on the role of demographic, economic and job characteristics. The outcomes reveal that the levels and determinants of short-term mobility differ remarkably in the various institutional models across Europe, particularly regarding household composition, demographic attributes, education levels and job positions.

Two gender inequality indicators are used: the gap in female to male primary education enrolment ratios and the gap in female to male secondary education enrolment ratios. Estimation results indicate that gender inequality in primary and secondary education has a statistically significant negative effect on income, especially in North African and Middle Eastern countries. In relatively open economies, gender inequality in education seems to have an additional effect, but this effect is consistently positive, suggesting that while trade contributes to higher income it may be accompanied by greater inequality. Overall, the results in this paper provide further evidence that the international development community's focus on reducing gender inequality and achieving universal primary education is well founded.

One flagship project that tries to measure the environment in which businesses operate in countries across the world is the World Bank's Doing Business project, which was launched in 2002. This project gathers quantitative data to compare regulations faced by small and medium-size enterprises across economies and over time. The centerpiece of the project is the annual Doing Business report. It was first published in 2003 with five sets of indicators for 133 economies, and currently includes 11 sets of indicators for 189 economies. The report includes a table that ranks each country in the world according to its scores across the indicators. The Doing Business project has become a major resource for academics, journalists, and policymakers. The project also enjoys a high public profile with close to ten million hits on its website each year. With such interest, it's no surprise that the Doing Business report has come under intense scrutiny. In 2012, following discussions by its board, the World Bank commissioned an independent review panel to evaluate the project, on which I served as a member. In this paper, I first describe how the Doing Business project works and illustrate with some of the key findings of the 2015 report. Next, I address what is valuable about the project, the criticisms of it, and some wider political economy issues illustrated by the report.","London Sch Econ, Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Besley, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.besley@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,73,98,4,74,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that self-employed households have a preference for larger families to raise the likelihood that an inside family member will be a good match at running the business. This empirical relationship is established using a regression framework, including the use of instrumental variables estimation to allow for the possibility of endogeneity of the respondent's self-employment status and whether the respondent's spouse stays at home. Moreover, we find a slightly higher demand for sons among the self employed who are over 40 at the time of the 1990 U.S. Census: namely, given the exogenous variation in gender mix of prior children, self employed parents born prior to 1950 appear to have an increased demand for a third child if the first two children were not sons. This effect does disappear, however, for the later generation of respondents.","[Broussard, Nzinga H.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chami, Ralph] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Hess, Gregory D.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Dept Econ, Bauer Ctr, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; International Monetary Fund; Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Hess, GD (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Dept Econ, Bauer Ctr, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",ghess@cmc.edu,,,Reed Institute for Decision Sciences at Claremont McKenna College for Broussard,Reed Institute for Decision Sciences at Claremont McKenna College for Broussard,"We thank Bryan Engelhardt for excellent research assistance, and the Reed Institute for Decision Sciences at Claremont McKenna College for Broussard's funding.

A duopoly model is considered in which two identical firms producing homogeneous commodities compete in quantities. They face uncertain market demand in a context in which two different future scenarios are possible, and no information about the probability distribution of occurrence of the scenarios is available. This decision-making situation is formalized as a normal-form game with vector-valued utility functions for which the notion of Pareto equilibrium is adopted as a natural extension of that of Cournot equilibrium. Under standard assumptions about the demand functions, we characterize the complete set of Pareto equilibria. In the second part of the paper, we analyse the equilibria to which the agents will arrive depending on their attitude to risk. We find that equilibria always exist if both agents are simultaneously pessimistic or optimistic. In the non-trivial cases, for pessimistic firms, infinitely many equilibria exist, whereas when firms act optimistically, only those pairs of strategies corresponding to the Cournot equilibria in each scenario can be equilibria.","[Caraballo, M.

In parallel, a new mainstream emerged, and the institutionalists were extremely dissatisfied with the path taken by the economic science.

We construct a historical account of the institutionalists' dissatisfaction with post-war economics based on archival material from the personal papers of Allan Gruchy, John Gambs, John Blair, and Clarence Ayres. In the period analyzed, the economists, who would later found the Association for Evolutionary Economics, acted as dissenters rather than institutionalists.

We analyze norm enforcement behavior of newly appointed police commissioners in both a game with positive externalities (based on a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism) and a similar game with negative externalities. Depending on the treatment, a reward or sanction institution is either exogenously or endogenously implemented. Police commissioners cooperate significantly more in both games and bear a higher burden of the sanction costs compared to non-police subjects. When the norm enforcement institution is endogenous, subjects favor rewards over sanctions, but police subjects are more likely to vote for sanctions. Police subjects also reward and sanction more than the others when the institution results from a majority vote.

These observations suggest that the composition of unobserved skills may be subject to sharp movements within low-educated employed workers, while the scale of these movements is potentially much smaller within high-educated ones. The standard college-premium framework accounts for the observed shifts between education categories, but it cannot account for unobserved compositional changes within education categories. Our paper uses Heckman's two-step estimator on repeated Current Population Survey cross sections to calculate a relative supply series that corrects for unobserved compositional shifts due to selection into and out of the FTFY status. We find that the well-documented deceleration in the growth rate of relative supply of college-equivalent workers after mid-1980s becomes even more pronounced once we correct for selectivity. This casts further doubt on the relevance of the plain skill-biased technical change (SBTC) hypothesis. We conclude that what happens to the within-group unobserved skill composition for low-educated groups is critical for fully understanding the trends in the relative supply of college workers in the United States. We provide several interpretations to our selection-corrected estimates.","[Elitas, Zeynep; Ercan, Hakan] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Tumen, Semih] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Tumen, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",zelitas@metu.edu.tr; hercan@metu.edu.tr; semih.tumen@tcmb.gov.tr,"Ercan, Hakan/D-1278-2010; Tumen, Semih/S-3412-2019","Ercan, Hakan/0000-0001-5130-5005; Tumen, Semih/0000-0002-8841-2290",,,,,36,0,0,0,16,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Motivations and Stages of Moral Reasoning,REVIEW OF RADICAL POLITICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,social dilemmas; experimental economics; sociocognitive and moral reasoning; adult development; C72; C92; D74,COOPERATION; SELECTION; DILEMMAS; BEHAVIOR,"As institutional economists recognize the limits of the canonical self-interest assumption, the lack of a theory of human valuation specifying the determinants of individuals' utility judgments renders the prediction of behavior in collective action dilemmas virtually impossible. This problem hinders our ability to devise institutions to help cope with a variety of pressing social dilemmas that persist. We suggest that scholars can overcome this difficulty by integrating models of sociocognitive and moral development into the framework of institutional analysis and that such integration aligns with a new revolutionary shift in the social sciences. This shift is evidenced by the rehabilitation of key notions once downplayed due to the dominance of positivism. We present results from hypothesis testing linked to a cognitivist-developmental theory of human valuations. These results demonstrate that cooperative motivations and choices in public goods provision dilemmas are associated with further stages of interior development of the participants.

In the existing literature, the intergenerational conflict model suggests a negative effect, although a growing number of studies are finding theoretical and empirical evidence of a positive effect. After controlling for the district fixed effect, the analysis of the Korean data shows that the elderly population share has a significant positive effect on the local school subsidy per pupil. This result is robust after instrumenting the real proportion of the elderly population by the predicted proportion, assuming no population mobility, to handle the possible bias caused by Tiebout sorting.","Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Go, S (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",sungo@cau.ac.kr,"Go, Sun/AAR-5195-2020",,,,,,19,2,2,0,6,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The growth imperative in Binswanger's model is established through a profit-loan linkage such that loans, as well as the economy as a whole, must grow at a suficiently high rate so that firms make positive profits. To come to this conclusion, Binswanger derives a particular steady-state rate of growth in which profits are zero, which he refers to as the zero profit growth rate. In his note, Gilanyi derives his own minimum growth rate based on a constant money supply. Gilanyi then compares the two minimum growth ratesBinswanger's zero profit growth rate and his monetary growth rateto determine which one is the binding constraint on the model. Upon comparison, Gilanyi shows that his monetary constraint is always the binding constraint implying that the zero profit growth rate is redundant. This paper shows that after reformulating Binswanger's model in order to make its equations stock-flow consistent, the resulting zero profit rate of growth is always the binding constraint. This zero profit rate of growth is thus not redundant as was the case in Binswanger's model, and, on the contrary, it is Gilanyi's monetary constraint that is redundant in the reformulated model.","Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60660 USA",Loyola University Chicago,"Johnson, R (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60660 USA.",,,,,,,,20,4,5,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The developed world is now suffering from another bout of such angst. Anxieties over technology can take on several forms, and we focus on three of the most prominent concerns. First, there is the concern that technological progress will cause widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment and a further increase in inequality in the short run, even if the long-run effects are beneficial. Second, there has been anxiety over the moral implications of technological process for human welfare, broadly defined. While, during the Industrial Revolution, the worry was about the dehumanizing effects of work, in modern times, perhaps the greater fear is a world where the elimination of work itself is the source of dehumanization. A third concern cuts in the opposite direction, suggesting that the epoch of major technological progress is behind us. Understanding the history of technological anxiety provides perspective on whether this time is truly different. We consider the role of these three anxieties among economists, primarily focusing on the historical period from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and then compare the historical and current manifestations of these three concerns.","[Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Econ & Hist, Evanston, IL USA; [Vickers, Chris] Auburn Univ, Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas L.] Univ Iowa, Econ, Iowa City, IA USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Iowa,"Mokyr, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",j-mokyr@northwestern.edu; czvickers@auburn.edu; nicolas-ziebarth@uiowa.edu,,"Ziebarth, Nicolas/0000-0002-2493-791X; Vickers, Chris/0000-0002-9697-8518",,,,,90,222,259,10,91,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We then propose a correct inferential procedure for testing the null hypothesis of no relationship in a LHR (finite-sample and asymptotic evidence supports the procedure).

Adopting key perspectives of Karl Polanyi and other thinkers, we develop our examination under the seemingly perpetual conflict between markets and social reproduction. We argue that financialization has both expanded market spaces and changed relationships within those spaces. The ever-greater domination of financial markets means that employment has become increasingly more precarious in the strict spaces of the labor market. At the same time, financialization has steadily eroded the social forms that exist outside of formal markets, greatly weakening the mechanisms through which societies can both defend themselves from predatory markets and reproduce themselves with some degree of purpose and hope for the future.","[Vidal, Gregorio; Marshall, Wesley] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Correa, Eugenia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Vidal, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Two different DEA models are designed to obtain DEA scores along financial and social perspectives.

This methodological framework aims at assessing the trade-offs between the overall employment, GDP and energy savings associated with the building sector (residential, private services and public services). Distinct impacts, namely on direct and indirect employment generation, environment (CO2 emissions), energy security supply (energy imports and renewable energy production) and other relevant economic indicators are also analysed. Different sets of input parameters for the economic context and the environmental impacts have been defined as interval coefficients to account for uncertainty.

The model allows for firm level heterogeneity in both demand and productivity and lets the mass of firms that enter be endogenous. Trade preferences given by one country have positive spillovers on exports to others in this model. Preferences given by the EU to Bangladesh in an industry raise profits, resulting in entry, and some of these firms also export to the US. In contrast, simple competitive models would predict a fall in exports to the US. Such spillovers are shown to be large when exports are not constrained by quotas, suggesting that unilateral preferences given to developing countries might be more efficacious than expected in promoting their exports. The parameters of the model are estimated using cross sectional customs data on Bangladeshi exports of apparel to the US and EU. Counterfactual experiments regarding the effects of reducing costs, both fixed and marginal, or of trade preferences (with distortionary Rules of Origin) offered by an importing country are performed. The counterfactuals show that reducing fixed costs at various levels has very different effects and suggest that such reductions are more effective in promoting exports when applied at later stages when firms are more committed to production. A subsidy of 1.5 million dollars to industry entry costs raises exports by only 40 cents for every dollar spent, but when applied to fixed costs of production, it raises exports by $25 per dollar spent.

Our structural model suggests two channels. On the one hand, multinational activity offers diversification benefits: risk premia should be higher for firms operating in countries where shocks co-vary more with the domestic ones. Second, hysteresis and operating leverage induced by fixed and sunk costs of production imply that risk premia should be higher for firms operating in countries where it is costlier to enter and produce. Our empirical analysis confirms these predictions and delivers a decomposition of firm-level risk premia into individual countries' contributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The growth in local outcomes attributable to the boom is found to be U-shaped and significant across all distributional segments, leading to somewhat increased local inequality aggregates and reduced local poverty. This pattern is preserved but varies across sectors, driving a large local inequality increase in energy extraction, with smaller rises and reductions in other industries.","[Marchand, Joseph] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Alberta,"Marchand, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada.",joseph.marchand@ualberta.ca,"Marchand, Joseph/GSD-7311-2022","Marchand, Joseph/0000-0002-5894-320X",,,,,31,11,14,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Based on a global scenario analysis, we examine the impact on the economy of advancement in energy technologies, considering both individual technologies and the interactions between pairs of technologies, with a focus on the role of uncertainty. Nuclear and CCS have the most impact on abatement costs, with CCS mostly important at high levels of abatement. We show that CCS and Bio-electricity are complements, while most of the other energy technology pairs are substitutes. We also examine for stochastic dominance between R&D portfolios; given the uncertainty in R&D outcomes, we examine which portfolios would be preferred by all decision-makers, regardless of their attitude toward risk. We observe that portfolios with CCS tend to stochastically dominate those without CCS; and portfolios lacking CCS and Nuclear tend to be stochastically dominated by others. We find that the dominance of CCS becomes even stronger as uncertainty in climate damages increases. Finally, we show that there is significant value in carefully choosing a portfolio, as relatively small portfolios can dominate large portfolios. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, we consider the bilingual game, where each player chooses one of two conventions or adopts both (i.e., chooses the bilingual option) at an additional cost. For this game, we completely characterize when a convention spreads contagiously from a finite subset of players to the entire population in some network, and conversely, when a convention is never invaded by the other convention in any network. We show that the Pareto-dominant (risk-dominant, resp.) convention is contagious if the cost of bilingual option is low (high, resp.). Furthermore, if the cost is in a medium range, both conventions are each contagious in respective networks, and in particular, the Pareto-dominant convention is contagious only in some non-linear networks. Second, we consider general supermodular games, and compare networks in terms of their power of inducing contagion. We show that if there is a weight-preserving node identification from one network to another, then the latter is more contagion-inducing than the former in all supermodular games.

This paper gives reasons for why mainstream economics has neglected the idea of meaningful work. It identifies the idea of the disutility of work, the assumption of free choice on the part of workers and the use of a formal and individualistic method as key constraints on the ability of mainstream economics to incorporate the idea of meaningful work. It also addresses the contribution of happiness economics and shows how it is unable to encompass the idea of meaningful work. Ideas on work from heterodox economics are then discussed. These ideas provide essential insight and inspiration for the incorporation of the idea of meaningful work into the economics of work. In all respects, the paper seeks to contribute towards the development and promotion of a heterodox economics of work that has the goal of meaningful work at its centre.","[Spencer, David A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Spencer, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",das@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,17,18,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Due to innovations new product varieties of a still higher quality enter the market every period rendering old varieties obsolete. For a given technology (variety) production costs decrease after an infant period due to learning. While all firms are assumed to be symmetric in a life-cycle perspective, at a given point in time firms of different ages differ in productivity, firm size, product quality, and export behavior. The model highlights a process of creative destruction, which allows firms to produce in a finite span of periods determined by the intensity of product and process innovations. The model predicts a wide range of export behavior of the individual firm during its life cycle depending on the structure of technological progress and trade costs. These predictions are consistent with empirical evidence on firm's internationalization in a dynamic perspective.","[Hansen, Jorgen Drud] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Kvedaras, Virmantas] Vilnius State Univ, Dept Econometr Anal, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Nielsen, Jorgen Ulff-Moller] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Vilnius University; Aarhus University,"Nielsen, JUM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Aarhus, Denmark.",jum@asb.dk,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

First, we identify marginal households whose debts are excessive and whose financial soundness is weak, and examine how much these household groups would grow should external shocks occur. This sensitivity analysis shows that the low-income brackets are highly exposed to rollover and default risks, and that a decline in housing prices is an important factor affecting the vulnerability of household debt. Furthermore, we employ a debt dynamics equation and a primary savings reaction function in order to derive the debt limit for each income quintile, and find that the sustainable debt ratio for each income quintile differs in line with the interest rate burden of the household sector, income fluctuations and savings capability. According to the results of this analysis, the first quintile at the bottom income level records debt ratios close to their debt limit, calling for urgent debt restructuring for this income class.","[Lee, Dongyeol; Lim, Hyunjoon] Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",dylee@bok.or.kr,"LIM, HYUNJOON/GVR-9115-2022; Lee, Dongyeol/N-3322-2016","Lee, Dongyeol/0000-0001-9359-8117",,,,,13,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The resources potentially available to address poverty may be measured by the total amount by which the incomes of the non-poor exceed the same poverty line. The ratio of the poverty gap to the resources potentially available is equal to the proportional tax rate on incomes in excess of the poverty line that would be required to fund a transfer sufficient to raise the incomes of all poor people to the poverty line.

Furthermore, this premium concentrates on low-skilled workers, while high-skilled individuals in the public sector suffer a pay penalty. Secondly, the gender gap is substantially larger in the private sector. Lastly, we analyse what happens in some specific activities, Education and Human health and social work, where both public and private sector coexist to a large extent.

To address the endogeneity of market structure we analyse the English public hospital sector where entry and exit are controlled by the central government. Because closing hospitals in areas where the governing party is expecting a tight election race (marginals) is rare due to the fear of electoral defeat, we can use political marginality as an instrumental variable for the number of hospitals in a geographical area. We find that higher competition results in higher management quality, measured using a new survey tool, and improved hospital performance. Adding a rival hospital increases management quality by 0.4 standard deviations and increases survival rates from emergency heart attacks by 9.7%. We confirm the robustness of our IV strategy to hidden policies that could be used in marginal districts to improve hospital management and to changes in capacity that may follow from hospital closure.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, NBER, Ctr Econ Performance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bloom, Nicholas; Propper, Carol; Van Reenen, John] CEPR, London, England; [Propper, Carol] CMPO Univ Bristol, Imperial Coll, Bristol, Avon, England; [Seiler, Stephan] Stanford Univ, Ctr Econ Performance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Van Reenen, John] NBER, Ctr Econ Performance, London Sch Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Imperial College London; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, NBER, Ctr Econ Performance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019; Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019","Propper, Carol/0000-0002-8257-431X; Seiler, Stephan/0000-0001-8636-1840","ESRC through the Centre for Economic Performance and CMPO; U.K. Department of Health through the HREP programme; National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/J023108/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J023108/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC through the Centre for Economic Performance and CMPO(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); U.K. Department of Health through the HREP programme; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This is an extensively updated version of Bloom et al.

Rather than shifts between low and high inflation, the nonlinearity arises when large swings in the exchange rate trigger market entries and exits of foreign firms. Switching regressions are used to distinguish between low and high pass-through regimes of the exchange rate into import prices. For the case of Switzerland, the corresponding results suggest that, though inflation has been low and stable, the ERPT still doubles in value in times of a rapid appreciation of the Swiss Franc.","Study Ctr Gerzensee, CH-3115 Gerzensee, Switzerland",Study Center Gerzensee,"Herger, N (通讯作者)，Study Ctr Gerzensee, Dorfstr 2,POB 21, CH-3115 Gerzensee, Switzerland.",nils.herger@szgerzensee.ch,,"Herger, Nils/0000-0003-2641-3412",,,,,25,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The ultimate objective is to develop a description of today's techno-productive paradigm and the differential role that the various sectors play in it. An analysis of export data from 113 countries and territories for 2005-2009 indicates that the key sectors in the world economy are: industrial machinery, scientific and medical instruments, and pharmaceuticals. The strong performance of sectors based on mature technologies suggests that key sectors originating in different stages in history can survive and overlap one another, much like geological strata, owing to the persistence of older technological systems.","Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Sch Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Revetria, FI (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Sch Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay.",fisabella@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,11,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2015,,115,,,,,23,39,,,,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CO9NA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359501300002,0

We study Markov-perfect insurance contracts in which neither party can commit beyond the current period. We show that the limited commitment assumption on the insurer's side is restrictive only when he is endowed with a rate of return advantage and the agent has sufficiently large initial assets. In such a case, the agent's consumption profile is distorted relative to the first-best.

As an exclusion restriction, we take advantage of differences in efficiency levels across administrative agencies that process subsidy applications and payments.

However, grandmothers' childcare availability depends highly on their LFP. When grandmothers work, intergenerational income transfers to their daughters may increase at the expense of time transfers (through childcare). Using a Two-stage Two-steps Least Squares estimation, we exploit changes in legal retirement ages in Italy to explore the relationship between mothers' LFP and daughters' LFP and fertility choices. We show that even though grandmothers who participate in the labor force provide less childcare, their daughters are more likely to have children and less likely to participate in the labor force. This can be explained by the increase in family income as a result of mothers' LFP offsetting the influence of the reduction in childcare.

We replicate these results but further demonstrate substantial heterogeneity by demographic group. In particular, the two groups that have most moved against income redistribution are the elderly and African Americans. We find little evidence that these subgroup trends are explained by relative economic gains or growing cultural conservatism, two common explanations. We further show that the trend among the elderly is uniquely American, at least relative to other developed countries with comparable survey data. While we are unable to provide definitive evidence on the cause of these two groups' declining redistributive support, we provide additional correlations that may offer fruitful directions for future research on the topic. One story consistent with the data on elderly trends is that older Americans worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular through cuts to Medicare. We find that the elderly have grown increasingly opposed to government provision of health insurance and that controlling for this tendency explains about 40 percent of their declining support for redistribution. For blacks, controlling for their declining support for race-targeted aid explains nearly 45 percent of their differential decline in redistributive preferences, which raises a further question: Why has support for race-targeted aid fallen during a period when black economic catch-up to whites has stalled?","[Ashok, Vivekinan; Washington, Ebonya] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kuziemko, Ilyana] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Yale University; Princeton University,"Ashok, V (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,47,43,55,0,24,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper explores the effects of two school-based management programs on parental investment in schools via voluntary contributions. One program provides both a cash grant and a matching scheme for privately raised funds. Difference-in-differences estimation shows that parents in richer schools increased voluntary contributions by 28%, while parents in poorer schools decreased voluntary contributions by 11%. This implies that a matching scheme results in higher inequality in resources available to schools. The second program provides only a cash grant to poor schools. Based on a randomized control, estimation shows that parents use 83% of the grant to substitute for voluntary contributions. A cash grant alone for poor schools results in an increase in resources available to the school in less than the cash grant transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier BAT.

These two features imply that it is in the owner's best interest that the driver exerts as little effort as possible while still leasing the motorcycle from him. The problem with low-effort implementation is that the motorcycle will not generate enough revenue. I analyse the contractual arrangements between owners and the drivers in this market using survey data from four cities in Togo and Benin. Evidence suggests that the quest for trust through kinship between owner and driver may explain the prevalence of a contract that induces drivers to exert excessive effort, leading to adverse outcomes like traffic accidents.","Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Blimpo, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",moussa.blimpo@ou.edu,,"Blimpo, Moussa/0000-0003-3168-9042",,,,,17,8,8,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

And why is the liberal, litigation-based, equal pay policy regime set up by the Gender Equality Act of 1996 much less effective than the neocorporatist 'accompanying measures' to the Bilateral European Union-Switzerland Agreement on Free Movement of Persons adopted in 1999 to ensure equal pay for workers of different national origins? The formation of two different policy regimes cannot be explained by different levels of political will. Equally, different 'varieties of capitalism' cannot explain the setup of the two different equal pay policy regimes within the very same country. Instead, our qualitative comparative analysis across time suggests that the differences can be best explained by a particular constellation of attributes, namely the use of different policy frames-i.e. 'anti-discrimination' in the EPG and 'unfair competition' in the EPN case- and the different setting of interest politics epitomised by the opposite stances adopted by Switzerland's employer associations in the two cases.","[Erne, Roland] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Imboden, Natalie] Unia, Bern, Switzerland",University College Dublin,"Erne, R (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Belfield 4, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Roland.Erne@ucd.ie,"Erne, Roland/AAC-2700-2021","Erne, Roland/0000-0003-2791-4454",Transnational Labour Group at the Centre for Advanced Study in Oslo; Natalie Imboden the School of Business at University College Dublin,Transnational Labour Group at the Centre for Advanced Study in Oslo; Natalie Imboden the School of Business at University College Dublin,"University College Dublin (RE) and Unia, Berne, Switzerland (NI).

Traditional measures of progress such as GDP have long been recognized as an incomplete picture of the state of the nation. Following a six-month National Debate that elicited 34,000 responses, ONS developed a framework for measuring national well-being consisting of 10 domains and 40 headline indicators. The indicators include a mixture of both subjective and objective measures. Through supplementing existing economic measures, such as GDP, with measures that reflect social and environmental well-being, national well-being looks at the state of the nation through a broader lens. The paper will describe the development of the framework of indicators, including developing subjective well-being measures, and the dissemination of this information using a range of interactive tools developed for this purpose. This is a long term development program and is still in its early days of measurement. How these data are used to improve policy design, delivery, and evaluation will be important to assess the success of the program. In particular, having a more complete picture of national well-being will lead to a better understanding of policy impacts on well-being; better allocation of resources; more informed decisions; assessment of government performance; and international comparisons.","[Everett, Glenn] Measuring Natl Well Being, Off Natl Stat, Newport, Gwent, Wales",,"Everett, G (通讯作者)，Govt Off, Off Natl Stat, Cardiff Rd, Newport NP10 8XG, Gwent, Wales.",glenn.everett@ons.gsi.gov.uk,,,,,,,5,14,15,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Under the social identity theory, women in managerial positions, that can affect the wage of their subordinates, are likely to evaluate female employees better than male employees. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the gender characteristics of middle managers on the wages of directly subordinated rank-and-file employees using a variation within the firm. We have used two methods to consider the effect of the manager gender characteristics on subordinates: the estimation of the wage function and the average treatment effect on the treated, both supplemented by a matching procedure. We concluded that women in middle management in comparison to their male counterparts have a lower tendency to apply wage discrimination against women. The presence of a female head of department led to a decrease in the gender pay gap by almost 7 percentage points.","Coll Polytech, Dept Econ Studies, Jihlava, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Hedija, V (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech, Dept Econ Studies, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",veronika.hedija@vspj.cz,"Hedija, Veronika/AFO-7966-2022","Hedija, Veronika/0000-0002-5353-1505",,,,,19,9,9,1,29,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Women's greater attraction to co-operative incentives results in part from their more optimistic assessments of their prospective teammate's ability. Women also respond differently to alternative rules for team formation in a manner that is consistent with advantageous inequity aversion.

In producing exports, they also use imported inputs disproportionately, which complicates the measurement of domestic content embedded in exports and the distribution of income generated from exports. In this paper, we extend the method developed by Koopman et al. (2012) to further distinguish between Chinese exports by FIEs and Chinese-owned enterprises (COEs), in addition to processing and normal exports. We propose an accounting framework and a detailed estimation procedure that separately account for the production and trade activities of FIEs and COEs. First, we decompose gross exports into domestic and foreign content by firm types. Then, we estimate factor ownership by firm types based on enterprise surveys. Finally, we compute the distribution of domestic content by factor ownership. Empirical estimation is based on China's 2007 benchmark input-output tables, supplemented by detailed trade and production statistics. Firm heterogeneity within each industry is identified by linking the NBS enterprises survey and the Customs' firm-level trade data. The empirical results from 2007 indicate the following: (1) domestic content accounted for around 59% of total exports; (2) FIEs operating in China created nearly 45% of the domestic content in Chinese exports, whereas processing COEs only contributed by less than 5%; (3) in terms of income distribution, about 52.6% of the value of Chinese exports was captured by foreign factor owners.

We find that contractionary monetary policy statistically significantly increases the firms' liquidity constraint. Especially, the smaller the firm size, the greater the effects of contractionary monetary policy. Therefore, our estimation results support the presence of a balance sheet channel. In addition, the firms' liquidity constraint decreases significantly during quantitative monetary easing policy (QMEP) period. Specifically, QMEP relaxes the liquidity constraint of large firms. Our evidence suggests that QMEP transmission works through the balance sheet channel and affects the real economy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Money-maximizing behavior in the experiment sorts subjects by academic ability, as measured by performance on verbal analogy questions, across two levels of question difficulty. Sorting behavior is publicly revealed in our audience treatment, facilitating social signaling. In the intrinsic only treatment, the signaling mechanism was explained but decisions were kept private. In the control, there was no discussion of the signaling mechanism and all decisions were private. We find that intrinsic only subjects were significantly more likely to choose the high-type action than the control. In comparison, subjects were significantly less likely to choose the signal in the audience treatment, when doing so was publicly observed. The effects are more pronounced in males. The results suggest that social observation can demotivate individuals when decisions signal intelligence, despite evidence that the underlying trait was privately considered desirable. Audience effects have a less predictable impact on behavior in this setting as compared to the near universally positive findings from the altruism and trust literature. Our experimental design can be easily adapted to study image motives in a broad set of environments using revealed preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[McManus, T.

To this end, I empirically chose a multinational pharmaceutical enterprise (MNE) as an illustrative example. The results reveal that Suzhou and Chongqing cities are in the best positions in the competition as a result of having external opportunities for development and internal competing strength. Moreover, the MNE could adopt a niche-focus strategy for the market by focusing on specific ailments to which people in Chinese communities are vulnerable to strengthen their competitive strengths.

The findings which have been claimed for some time now are upheld: production-related occupations will lose in significance, while further increases in employment particularly in occupations in the service sector are to be expected. Accordingly, the demand for personnel with a degree from a university or a university of applied sciences will go on rising, while the labour market opportunities for unskilled workers will continue to fall. However, vocational training or its academic counterparts still remain the dominant form of training in Germany.

During financial crisis periods, market volatility is relatively higher than IVOL - a plausible reason is high correlation between firms' returns.

We also examine how schools respond to bans on racial preferences and the effects these responses have on racial diversity at elite schools. With regard to majority students, we examine the evidence on the returns to attending a more racially diverse school, as well as how racial preferences affect friendship formation.

Comparing the performance of the models to the benchmark random-walk model by root mean-square errors, the two structural (theoretical) models, especially the nonlinear model, perform well on average across all forecast horizons in our ex post, out-of-sample forecasts, although at specific forecast horizons certain nonlinear atheoretical models perform the best.

While most of the previous literature uses the volatility of IPO initial returns to measure risk, we focus on different risk measures, namely firm-level systematic and idiosyncratic volatilities and the market-wide implied volatility index (VIX), to assess their role in the IPO cycle. Our results shed new light on (1) which risk measure is important in the determination of IPO cycles, (2) the temporal pattern of each risk component across issuing firms and (3) the relationship between market-wide uncertainty and IPO risk. Our findings reveal a lead-lag relationship between IPO waves, VIX and the IPO systematic risk measure. We also highlight the fact that market-level uncertainty predicts IPO activity and the level of idiosyncratic risk of the next-period-issuing firms. Issuing firms' systematic risk can only be predicted by the systematic risk of firms now proceeding to their offering. The main implication resulting from our study is that one can better anticipate hot-issue' markets, as well as the specific risk components of future new issues. This will help improve upon the regulatory environment, IPO investment decisions and IPO timing given market receptivity.","[Beaulieu, Marie-Claude; Bouden, Habiba Mrissa] Univ Laval, Ctr Interuniv Risque Polit Econ & Emploi, Dept Finance Assurance & Immobilier, Chaire RBC Innovat Financieres,Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Beaulieu, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ctr Interuniv Risque Polit Econ & Emploi, Dept Finance Assurance & Immobilier, Chaire RBC Innovat Financieres,Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Marie-Claude.Beaulieu@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,"Chaire RBC en innovations financieres; Centre interuniversitaire sur le risque, et les politiques economiques et l'emploi (CIRPEE); Institut de finance mathematique de Montreal (IFM2); Fonds quebecois de recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)","Chaire RBC en innovations financieres; Centre interuniversitaire sur le risque, et les politiques economiques et l'emploi (CIRPEE); Institut de finance mathematique de Montreal (IFM2); Fonds quebecois de recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","This work was supported by the Chaire RBC en innovations financieres, the Centre interuniversitaire sur le risque, et les politiques economiques et l'emploi (CIRPEE), Institut de finance mathematique de Montreal (IFM2), the Fonds quebecois de recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).",,39,5,5,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Both autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and vector error correction modeling (VECM) show that Chinese growth is led by all three energy sources. Economic growth also causes coal, oil and renewables consumption, but with negative own-price effects for coal and oil and a strong possibility of fuel substitution through positive cross-price effects. The results further show coal consumption causing pollution, while renewable energy consumption reduces emissions. No significant causation on emissions is found for oil. Hence, making coal both absolutely and relatively expensive compared to oil and renewable energy encourages shifting from coal to oil and renewable energy, thereby improving economic and environmental sustainability.

A cluster analysis is used to divide the nations into individual groups. The Feder-Ram model and multiple regression analysis with modified variables are then estimated for all groups based on the cluster analysis. The findings of the regression analysis mainly verified the hypothesis and showed a significant positive relationship between defence spending and economic growth in the case of more resource-abundant countries, and a significant negative relationship in the case of more resource-constrained countries.

We first show that, after the release of the WHIS findings, HRT use dropped sharply among postmenopausal women. We then estimate the spillover effects of the WHIS findings on preventive care by means of a difference-in-differences methodology comparing changes in preventive care use among 60 to 69 year-old women (who have high rates of HRT use) with the change among women aged 75 and above (who have much lower rates of HRT use). Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the period 1998-2007, we find that women aged 60-69 had statistically and economically significant declines in their annual mammography checks, checkups, cholesterol checks and blood stool tests, when compared to older women.","[Daysal, N.

Cases when self-image becomes an obsession may result in a body dysmorphic disorder named 'muscle dysmorphia' (MD). The combination of psychological, environmental and biological drivers determines the appearance and development of this disorder. In this article, we developed a discrete population mathematical model to forecast the rate of prevalence of males who are noncompetitive bodybuilders at risk of suffering MD in Spain in forthcoming years. Economic, emotional, sociological and psychological motivations were taken into account to quantify the dynamic behaviour of Spanish noncompetitive bodybuilders. The impact of the unemployment is reflected in the construction of two coefficients, alpha(u) and alpha(21), which explain subpopulation transits due to the economy. Sociological influences, such as human herding and social propagation, were also considered. Our results predict an increase in Spanish noncompetitive bodybuilders suffering MD from 1% in 2011 to around 11% in 2015. Our model can be applied to any other western country where data are available and to another study period when the hypotheses are applicable.","[De La Poza, E.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Fac Adm & Direcc Empresas, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Jodar, L.; Alkasadi, M.

In 2010, these firms accounted for about 47% of total Portugal's exports. Both the static and dynamic results of the estimated models confirm the positive influence of productivity on variations in exports. The dynamic estimations also suggest that exports in the previous period hold a positive effect on contemporaneous exports, confirming the Roberts and Tybout (1997) sunk cost hypothesis for exports. In the dynamic analysis, the labour costs and the size of the firm do not have a statistically significant effect on Portuguese exports with the findings also pointing to increased expenditure on research and development (R&D) generating no statistically significant effect on exports. The lagged R&D expenditure was also insignificant in explaining the change of Portuguese exports. Thus, these results suggest that applying a product or process innovation measure returns better results than indirect measures such as R&D expenditure.","[Faustino, Horacio C.] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, SOCIUS CSG, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Matos, Pedro Verga] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, ADVANCE CSG, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Faustino, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISEG, SOCIUS CSG, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",faustino@iseg.utl.pt,"Verga Matos, Pedro/M-6302-2013","Verga Matos, Pedro/0000-0002-6737-2656",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT Portugal); R&D Unit Multi-Year Funding Program [UID/SOC/04521/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT Portugal)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); R&D Unit Multi-Year Funding Program,The authors would like to thank Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT Portugal) for financial support to ADVANCE by the R&D Unit Multi-Year Funding Program UID/SOC/04521/2013.,,72,12,16,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The present paper examined unemployment hysteresis in five Estonian regions. It used two panel data methods, namely, the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IFS) test and the Fourier Im-Pesaran-Shin (FIPS) test. The originality and value of this paper is that this is the first study that uses the panel unit root tests to examine unemployment dynamics in the Estonian regions. The findings revealed that the unemployment rates in the Estonian regions could be best described as a stationary process. This result is in line with the natural rate hypothesis. A research implication is that this study has illustrated that nonlinear tests could be an appropriate approach to examine unemployment hysteresis because other methods may fail to reject the null hypothesis. A practical implication of this study is that it sheds light on the nature of unemployment dynamics in Estonia at the regional level. As the findings revealed, the unemployment rates in the Estonian regions had the mean-reversion property. Therefore, the higher-than-normal unemployment rates are likely to return to the natural level even in the absence of intervention policies initiated by the government or policy makers.","[Furuoka, Fumitaka] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Furuoka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"HABYARIMANA, CYPRIEN/I-3993-2016; Furuoka, Fumitaka/C-4197-2012","Furuoka, Fumitaka/0000-0003-1863-387X",,,,,31,3,3,0,10,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62.0,5,,,,,631,642,,10.2298/PAN1505631F,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CZ9JV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367414800005,0

The market is served by a duopoly of firms that choose both the quality and the price of their product. Consumers differ in their taste for quality and choose from which firm to buy. We compare four different treatments in which we vary the degree to which consumers are informed about quality. Contrary to theoretical predictions, firms do not differentiate quality under full information. Rather, both tend to offer products of similar, high quality, entailing more intense price competition than predicted by theory. Under no information, we observe a lemons outcome where quality is low. At the same time, firms manage to maintain prices substantially above marginal cost. In two intermediate treatments, quality is significantly higher than the no-information level, and there is evidence that prices become better predictors of quality. Taken together these findings suggest that information disclosure is a more effective tool to raise welfare and consumer surplus than theory would lead one to expect.

They obtained this result in a model where the asymmetry among regions translates into different gradients of the demand for capital but identical vertical intercepts. In this paper, we simply reverse the form of asymmetry by considering different vertical intercepts but identical gradients. The reason is that market power is typically related to the intercept and not to the slope of the demand function. We then show that leadership by the large region becomes the risk dominant equilibrium and can even become Pareto superior.

Indeed, in our view, the money, in the sense of M2, can constitute a long-run channel of growth transmission. Thus, this paper examines the long-term relationship among money supply (M2), income (GDP), and prices (CPI). The subprime crisis in 2007 has shown that the demand for money does not only meet motives of transaction, precaution, and speculation but also of fictional or quasi-fictional future demands due to the fact that they are created without real counterparts. The capacity of production systems in developed countries to respond to increases in money supply by creating more wealth, involves the assumption of money neutrality in the long-run. However, in developing countries, the excess of money supply may lead to inflation trends. The present study has confirmed the long-term non-neutrality of money supply in the USA, and its neutrality in Gabon and Morocco.","[Issaoui, Fakhri] Univ Manouba, Eco Super Econ Numer, Manouba, Tunisia; [Boufateh, Talel] Univ Manouba, Ecole Super Commerce Tunis, Manouba, Tunisia; [Guesmi, Mourad] Univ Jendouba, Fac Sci Jund Econom & Gest Jendouba, Jendouba, Tunisia",Universite de la Manouba; Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Jendouba,"Issaoui, F (通讯作者)，Univ Manouba, Eco Super Econ Numer, Manouba, Tunisia.",guesmimourad38@gmail.com,,"Boufateh, Talel/0000-0002-3816-3468",,,,,34,3,4,1,14,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62.0,3,,,,,287,320,,10.2298/PAN1503287I,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CM5WC,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357758700003,0

Significant negative effect can appear if the ratio of external funding to total assets is being uncontrollably increased over time.","[Janda, Karel] Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Inst Ekon Studii, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel; Zetek, Pavel] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Katedra Bankovnictvi & Pojistovnictvi, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Quang Van Tran] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Informat & Stat, Katedra Stat & Pravdepodobnosti, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Karlova, Fak Socialnich Ved, Inst Ekon Studii, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",karel-janda@seznam.cz; Tran@vse.cz; zetekpavel@centrum.cz,"janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022; Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022; janda, karel/A-3951-2008","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300",,,,,54,0,0,1,18,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We employ an error correction model in our analysis to test for short-run and long-run dynamics. We find no evidence of long-run relationship between crime and unemployment, when we look at both disaggregation by type of crime and disaggregation by region. Lack of evidence of a long-run relationship indicates we have no evidence of the motivation hypothesis. For selected types of property crimes, we find some evidence of a significant negative short-run relationship between crime and unemployment, lending support to the opportunity hypothesis.

Using nationally representative household survey data, the study systematically analyses the decentralised targeting performance of the FISP during the 2009-10 agricultural season. The analysis begins with a standard targeting assessment based on the rates of programme participation and the benefit amounts among the eligible and non-eligible populations and provides decompositions of the national targeting performance into the inter-district, intra-district inter-community, and intra-district intra-community components. This approach identifies the relative contributions of targeting at each level. The results show that the FISP is not poverty targeted and that the national government, the districts and the communities are nearly uniform in their failure to target the poor, with any minimal targeting (or mis-targeting) overwhelmingly materializing at the community level. The findings are robust to the choice of the eligibility indicator and the decomposition method. The multivariate analysis of household programme participation reinforces these results and reveals that the relatively well off, rather than the poor or the wealthiest, and the locally well-connected have a higher likelihood of programme participation, and, on average, receive a greater number of input coupons. Since a key programme objective is to increase food security and income among resource-poor farmers, the lack of targeting is a concern and should underlie considerations of alternative targeting approaches.","[Kilic, Talip] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Whitney, Edward] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Winters, Paul] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); American University,"Kilic, T (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, MSN MC3-306,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",tkilic@worldbank.org,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534; Whitney, Edward/0000-0002-4633-0844",,,,,49,25,30,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Given that most people obtain their information about the economy from the media, press coverage of the economy may exert an influence on peoples' attitudes. This paper tests for this influence by examining consumers' inflation perceptions in the aftermath of the euro cash changeover, which serves as a natural experiment. Using a new data set, that quantifies the intensity and tone of media reports, we document that media reporting has had a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact on inflation perceptions and contributed to their sharp rise in the aftermath of the euro cash changeover and to the divergence between inflation perceptions and actual inflation rates.

The analysis revealed that the entities' soundness became weaker immediately prior to the crisis, but this effect became insignificant after 2007. Securitization has facilitated a process of regulatory capital arbitrage leading to lower capital requirements while, at the same time, giving rise to a slight worsening of the quality of the originators' portfolios.

Countries with the greatest disparities in gender outcomes experience no significant impact of media freedom.","[Mitra, Aniruddha] Bard Coll, Econ Program, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Bang, James T.] St Ambrose Univ, Dept Finance Econ & Decis Sci, Davenport, IA 52803 USA; [Biswas, Arnab] Univ Wisconsin Stout, Dept Social Sci, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA",Saint Ambrose University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stout,"Mitra, A (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Econ Program, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",amitra@bard.edu,"Bang, James T./AAI-5922-2020","Bang, James T./0000-0002-7701-8220",,,,,62,6,6,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article analyses the financial and economic performance of the company in the 10 years before and after privatization. It finds that the change from public to private ownership was not strongly associated with improved financial performance and productivity as the company had experienced rapid growth and improvement in the pre-privatization period. These findings run counter to perspectives such as public choice theory that suggest a positive relationship between privatization and company performance. Performance in the post-privatization period was strongly influenced by greater exposure to market forces in the company's expanding food division; however, it is surprising that this greater competition did not translate into improved overall performance.","[Palcic, Donal; Reeves, Eoin] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Palcic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland.",donal.palcic@ul.ie,"Palcic, Donal/K-8682-2016; Ascasibar, Enrique/B-7498-2014; PEREIRA-LORENZO, SANTIAGO/M-3457-2018; Reeves, Eoin/K-8034-2016","Palcic, Donal/0000-0003-4726-9640; Reeves, Eoin/0000-0003-4674-3152",,,,,27,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We employ a dynamic correlation model on data from OECD countries for the period 1980-2010. Our findings demonstrate that international stock markets co-react in accordance with the underlying international economic forces. We also document three other results. First, the correlation among countries with respect to real economic activity is statistically positive, but the level of this correlation is lower than that of financial variables. Second, there is a significant increase over time in the international correlation level with respect to the financial variables. Finally, the creation of the Euro Monetary Union and the adoption of an inflation targeting policy in many countries have increased the international correlation of all of the financial variables tested.

This approach integrates various tools and methods into a single framework, which consists of five steps. In the Define step, problems and main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are identified. In the Measure step, the modified Failure Classifier (FC), i.e. DOE-NE-STD-1004-92 is applied, which enables to specify the types of failures for each operation during the production process. Also, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is used to measure the weight of failures by calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) value. In order to indicate the quality level of process/product the Process/Product Sigma Performance Level (PSPL) is calculated based on the FMEA results. Using the RPN values from FMEA the variability of process by failures, operations and work centres are observed. In addition, costs of the components are calculated, which enable to measure the impact of failures on the final product cost. A new method of analysis is introduced, in which various charts created in the Measure step are compared. Analysis step facilitates the subsequent Improve and Control steps, where appropriate changes in the manufacturing process are implemented and sustained. The objective of the new framework is to perform continuous improvement of production processes in the way that enables engineers to discover the critical problems that have financial impact on the final product. This framework provides new ways of monitoring and eliminating failures for production processes continuous improvement, by focusing on the KPIs important for business success. In this paper, the background and the key concepts of Six Sigma are described and the proposed Six Sigma DMAIC framework is explained. The implementation of this framework is verified by computational experiment followed by conclusion section.","[Sahno, Jevgeni; Shevtshenko, Eduard; Karaulova, Tatjana] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Tahera, Khadija] Open Univ, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Tallinn University of Technology; Open University - UK,"Sahno, J (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",jevgeni.sahno@gmail.com; eduard.sevtsenko@ttu.ee; tatjana.karaulova@ttu.ee; k.tahera@open.ac.uk,"Shevtshenko, Eduard/AAX-9827-2020; Shevtshenko, Eduard/AAH-4780-2019; Shevtshenko, Eduard/G-7337-2016; Karaulova, Tatjana/G-7354-2016","Shevtshenko, Eduard/0000-0002-1389-3245; Tahera, Khadija/0000-0001-8950-4173; Karaulova, Tatjana/0000-0002-4467-9161",Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [ETF9460],"Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",Hereby we would like to thank the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research for Grant ETF9460 which supports the research.,,33,12,17,3,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our empirical results indicate that lagged jump mean only explains around 16% of the weeldy convenience yield. Our best specification, including variation in inventories, 8-week realized variance and the 250-day jump mean is able to explain around 61% of the weekly convenience yield.

The analysis shows that income inequality is consistent with a smaller estimator of consumption and a greater estimator of investment. Second, the cycles of GDP, consumption and investment are dated separately to determine how the deepness and duration of cycles of those variables are correlated with the Gini indices of countries. The results show that income inequality leads to a deeper and longer decline of GDP, which causes a greater cumulative income loss of GDP during recession, and a somewhat faster speed of recovery during expansion. Likewise, the result of a correlation between Gini indices and the number of cycles in consumption, investment and GDP indicate that income inequality is associated with a greater number of cycles in consumption and GDP and a lower number of cycles in investment.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Sakarya, Cyprus",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Shahee, M (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Sakarya, Cyprus.",msshahee@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,8,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62.0,1,,,,,93,104,,10.2298/PAN1501093S,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF8QF,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352826300006,0

In this context, the main aim of the article is to analyse the influence and intensity of types of customer pressure on the innovative activity of a company. This article takes into account both the pressure from customers to introduce new products and the pressure from customers to lower the production costs. The research hypothesis allowing the attainment of the research goal is formulated as follows: The majority of innovations introduced by the companies from the countries of south-east part of the Baltic Sea are demand-driven, that is, they are a result of customer pressure. This means that the probability of occurrence of all the analysed attributes of innovative activity depends on the amount of pressure on the side of customers.

Published in 2012, Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st century became a worldwide sensation and best seller because of the depth of its analysis and the controversy created by its findings. In a nutshell Piketty claims that contrary to the neoclassical forecast, inequality in the world might grow, due to a shock between forces of convergence and forces of divergence. Furthermore, Piketty also claims that only redistribution policies can reduce the inequality trend, and calls for a new set of social policies. All this is very impressive but for us what matters the most is how to put IC in the analysis. In this context, we analyze Piketty's ideas using the concepts and theories on Intellectual Capital (Bonfour and Edvinsson 2005; Edvinsson and Malone, 1997; Kaplan and Norton, 1994), and we also recall what the main theories on inequalities are (Coleman, 1991, Atkinson 1983 or Stiglitz 2012), and about Welfare States (Esping Andersen, 1990). We find that in the history of socio-economic thought, Intellectual Capital and Inequalities have been marching in separate paths: not only the paradigms of analysis are totally different, but only a handful of empirical studies exist that bring together IC and inequalities. The fact is crucial for our paper because we believe that IC in fact increases inequality and explains growing inequality. We also found that Piketty almost does not address IC directly in his entire book, a fact that by itself speaks volumes about the position of IC in the world of socio-economic thought. Pikettys' analysis, for all its importance, and novelty, is traditional and surprisingly old fashioned when it comes to considering Intangibles. He never uses IC, he seems to be unware of IC analysis. However we also think that most of Piketty's analysis would gain strength if IC is considered (as we believe it certainly should be) as a major force of inequality in the economy of the 21st century. In the discussion of the paper we point out seven ways in which the inclusion of IC in the analysis could benefit Piketty's conclusions; the seven ideas relate to Human Capital, super-professionals, billionaires, social policies and development, taxes on wealth, modern slavery, and the rise of political oligarchies in the 21st century. The paper is of limited scope because it is basically theoretical. The paper is original because we don't know of any other previous study linking Piketty's book to IC analysis; in this context we believe further efforts should be done in this very relevant area of research.","[Tome, Eduardo] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal; [Tiulkova, Natalia] Univ St Petersburgh, St Petersburg, Russia",Universidade Europeia,"Tomé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal.",eduardo.tome@clix.pt; nathalie.tiulkova@gmail.com,"tome, eduardo/F-2308-2011","tome, eduardo/0000-0001-6335-5501",,,,,33,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,334,341,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600039,0

The dynamics of foreign exchange (forex) rate is a complex process that can be better understood through a study of its characteristics, such as for instance volatility. In this article the exchange rate fluctuation is analysed by calculating the sum of absolute differences (SAD) of a time series per hour. It has been shown empirically that a new time series constructed from SAD values is more suitable for predicting exchange rate volatility if it takes into account only the magnitude of the exchange rate fluctuation and ignores its direction. The analysis of EUR/USD exchange rate data at major financial centers has revealed that both exchange rates undergo periodical intraday variations; therefore, both additive and multiplicative versions of Holt-Winters exponential smoothing techniques have been applied in the analysis and predict of exchange rate volatility. These methods are appropriate for a time series with a linear trend and seasonal variations. Since a time series of SAD values does not have a clear trend, simplified versions (without changes in trend) of the Holt-Winters model were applied. Two different statistics - mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) - were applied to select the optimal parameters of four versions of the Holt-Winters model. The study showed that volatility is best predicted by a simplified version of the multiplicative Holt-Winters model.","[Valakevicius, Eimutis; Brazenas, Mindaugas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Valakevicius, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Studentu St 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.",eimval@ktu.lt; mindaugas.brazenas@gmail.com,"Valakevičius, Eimutis/Q-9444-2019","Valakevicius, Eimutis/0000-0003-1928-0631",,,,,28,7,7,0,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We further explore the relation between investment and returns over the 3 years around portfolio formation. The results show that the high investment firms earn higher returns than low investment firms before portfolio formation; however the high investment firms earn lower returns than low investment firms after portfolio formation, such evidence is supportive of investor's overreaction explanation. Additionally, the stock returns don't necessarily decrease after investment, and the stock returns don't significantly positively correlate with firm profitability or book-to-market, so the result don't support risk-based explanation. Overall, both our portfolio sort and two-stage cross-sectional regression analysis show that behavioral finance theories are better than risk-based theories in explaining the investment anomaly.

An important economic intuition in this context is that environmental degradation will be limited by human behaviour if costs and benefits of such degradation are local since economic agents will then be incentivized to choose appropriate corrective action. Therefore, we note the likelihood that regional economic development can help regions 'grow out of' environmental problems. Using a new data set from Yangtze River Delta of China, we find a strong confirmation of the intuition that human can and will resolve the environmental problem by altering the damaging behaviour of economic agents. A very interesting finding of this study is that the relationship between environmental quality and economic progress measured by per capita income can display a wave-like function in the case of water pollution, as opposed to the much dramatized environmental Kuznets curve, with significant policy implications.","[Zhang, Jingjing; Gangopadhyay, Partha] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Zhang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",njustzjj@gmail.com,"Zhang, Jing/HII-4294-2022","Gangopadhyay, Partha/0000-0001-6841-7791",,,,,26,12,13,4,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Prices have risen substantially in the last decade, especially in large urban cities, and some economists have expressed concerns about the affordability of residential housing for young adults. This phenomenon becomes a major concern for policymakers, in terms of managing policies to balance the residential needs of individuals and the transition to a market economy. Theoretically, house prices ought to be linked to economic factors such as disposable income, availability of land to build and credit policy. However, it appears that traditional economic theories fail to appropriately explain house prices in China. We provide an explanation from the perspective of capital inflows into China. In terms of per capita remittances, China receives the highest inflow of foreign capital, and this may have a significant impact on risk adjusted returns in the Chinese market. To investigate this relationship, we use the vector error correction model to assess the impact of capital inflows on house prices. We find that capital inflows have a significant positive effect on house prices. The study makes important contributions to understanding the relationship between house prices and foreign remittances after controlling for other economic factors. China is a large economy. Because the impact of economic development in China has not been consistent across the country, we address the regional differences in the house price changes to capital inflows. Using regional data, we show that capital inflows have an asymmetric effect on the housing market across different provinces and cities of China. This has important implications for the development of economic policies in China that aim to provide fair access to residential housing for everyone. These findings are also relevant to investors in the housing market, whether investing for a personal residential home or as part of their diversified investment portfolio. It will also be informative to see how a reversal of capital inflows associated with tighter financing conditions in advanced countries will affect house prices in China.","[An, Hui; Yu, Lijie] Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Gupta, Rakesh] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Dalian University of Technology; Griffith University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.gupta@griffith.edu.au,"Gupta, Rakesh/J-2793-2013","Gupta, Rakesh/0000-0001-6334-3420",,,,,44,4,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The models chosen for this empirical application are the herding model of Gilli and Winker (2003), its asymmetric version by Alfarano et al. (2005) and the more recent model by Franke and Westerhoff (2011), which all share a common lineage to the herding model introduced by Kirman (1993). In addition, standard ARCH processes are included for each financial series to provide a benchmark for the explanatory power of the models. The methodology provides a consistent and statistically significant ranking of the three models. More importantly, it also reveals that the best performing model, Franke and Westerhoff, is generally not distinguishable from an ARCH-type process, suggesting their explanatory power on the data is similar.

This crisis has been one of the defining economic events of the 1970s and has shaped how many economists think about oil price shocks. In recent years, a large literature on the economic determinants of oil price fluctuations has emerged. Drawing on this literature, we first provide an overview of the causes of all major oil price fluctuations between 1973 and 2014. We then discuss why oil price fluctuations remain difficult to predict, despite economists' improved understanding of oil markets. Unexpected oil price fluctuations are commonly referred to as oil price shocks. We document that, in practice, consumers, policymakers, financial market participants, and economists may have different oil price expectations, and that, what may be surprising to some, need not be equally surprising to others.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Baumeister, Christiane; Kilian, Lutz] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Notre Dame; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",cjsbaumeister@gmail.com; lkilian@umich.edu,,"putchakatla, venkateswarlu/0000-0002-5045-9819",,,,,52,250,278,6,144,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We explain market segmentation as a separating equilibrium in which finance premiums serve as a socially beneficial (although costly) signaling mechanism. Market segmentation under a uniform standard of Shariah compliance occurs when the Shariah Boards of two Islamic Finance Institutions (IFIs) use different degrees of stringency even though they agree on a common set of minimum requirements to comply with Shariah Law. Heterogeneous degrees of stringency chosen by different IFI Shariah Boards translate into different premiums paid by different customers. One IFI targets the moderately pious consumer segment while the other targets the highly pious segment. The IFI that targets highly pious consumers voluntarily offers a more limited set of investments and financing products. By allowing for multiple Muslim communities with distinct group identities and correspondingly variable willingness-to-pay to signal piety types, the model provides an explanation for market segmentation.

This creates an incentive for the physician to exploit patients' trust by recommending more services than necessary. Using data from Taiwan, which introduced a separating policy, that restricts physician ownership of pharmacies, we estimate that where the policy was binding, eliminating this incentive caused physicians to prescribe 7.1% less in drugs. Taking into account increases in complementary diagnostic services and that drugs are only a part of overall primary care spending, the policy reduced total expenditures by 1.8%. However, a large number of clinics exploited a loophole in the law and either had at baseline or integrated pharmacies into their practices post-policy making them exempt from the policy. As a result, the policy only reduced total drug expenditures by 2.1% and total primary care cost by 0.5%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Because inference on parameter ratios is associated with statistical issues, transforming the original utility maximization problem into a consumer surplus maximization model that provides direct inference on willingness to pay is thus desirable. Recent literature uses a parameter reparameterization from the original preference space to the desired willingness-to-pay space. However, we propose a slight variation to this reparameterization that is based on normalizing the marginal utility of income and that works particularly well for models with a general covariance matrix. (For logit-based models the normalization is equivalent to working with the standard reparameterization in willingness-to-pay space.) In fact, we show that Bayes implementation of the normalization of the marginal utility of income solves well-known problems of current multinomial probit samplers. The estimator that we propose effectively avoids defining proper priors on unidentified parameters as well as identification of priors for and making draws of a constrained covariance matrix, and improves the behavior of the predictive posterior of the choice probabilities. In addition, willingness-to pay estimates from previous studies can easily be used as proper priors in the proposed Gibbs sampler. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Aristotle developed a theory of human action, where we can find a place for agency'. His views on habits are linked to his theory of virtue and art (skill). Concerning institutions, Aristotle provides a sound social and political philosophy that encompasses the nature and role of institutions. The paper will subsequently present Aristotle's ideas on these three notions - agency, habits and institutions - and will finally establish which of the current accounts of institutions involved in the discussion sparked by Hindriks and Guala's recent paper (2005a) he would support. Given that some realities tackled in the paper are nowadays radically different from Aristotle's times, the paper tries to keep an Aristotelian-minded' point of view - that is, analysing current topics based on Aristotelian concepts.","[Crespo, Ricardo F.] IAE Univ Austral, Dept Econ, Pilar, Argentina; [Crespo, Ricardo F.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Pilar, Argentina",Austral University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Crespo, RF (通讯作者)，IAE Univ Austral, Dept Econ, Pilar, Argentina.;Crespo, RF (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Pilar, Argentina.",rcrespo@iae.edu.ar,"Crespo, Ricardo/AAF-3880-2020",,,,,,29,5,5,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Such policies are typically analyzed in their natural units such as jobs making comparison difficult across categories. An approach akin to a satellite national income and product account (NIPA) allows direct comparison of the relative importance and variability of these residual risks. Results are presented for an unusual geographic aggregate associated with coasts. Although this framing adds difficulties for integration into national accounts, precedents exist. The findings synthesize elements that would otherwise be separated or not reported in standard NIPA accounts. Some elements are found to be stable and large, while other elements exhibit high variability and a high level of damages potentially informing individual and policy choices.

In particular, we show that technical efficiency at the margin is crucial to determine whether the social responsibility of the non-profit firm increases or reduces welfare, assuming general demand and cost functions. This implies the paradoxical result that more social responsibility may reduce welfare. In addition, we introduce the concept of technical advantage in production and apply it to the study of a mixed duopoly considering convex quadratic cost functions. Interestingly, a firm may have a technical advantage in production and at the same time be technically less efficient than its rival at the margin. We show that the paradox eventually occurs as the non-profit firm exhibits more social responsibility if firms have quadratic cost functions. This can happen even if the non-profit firm has a substantial technical advantage over its rival. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Conversely, I find that total parental wealth does not have the same positive association for low-income black families, while home ownership may have negative associations with the likelihood of upward mobility for these families. However, for black families from the top half of the income distribution, home equity is associated with a decreased likelihood of downward mobility, suggesting a heterogeneous relationship between home ownership and mobility for black families.","[Fox, Liana E.] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Fox, LE (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",lef2118@columbia.edu,"Fox, Liana E/L-4398-2013",,,,,,29,9,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This generates a corrective argument for taxation: optimal marginal taxes are higher (lower) if individuals work too much (too little) from a well-being point of view. I allow for multidimensional heterogeneity and derive the optimal tax schedule in terms of measurable sufficient statistics. One of these statistics measures the degree to which individuals fail to optimize their labor supply. I empirically estimate this by using British life satisfaction data as a measure of well-being. I find that low-income workers tend to work 'too little' and high-income workers 'too much,' providing a motive for lower marginal tax rates at the bottom and higher marginal tax rates at the top of the income distribution.

We apply the NI/Mil queuing model to analyze the effect of mandated sharing of radio spectrum on the equilibrium connection quality, data volumes and prices. Our analysis shows that spectrum sharing can have adverse effects. First, it creates an incentive for the mobile operators to increase the load in their network in order to weaken the competitor. A higher network load leads to more network congestion and suboptimal equilibrium connection quality. Second, consumer surplus decreases and industry profit increases for a wide range of parameter values in the model. In other words, spectrum sharing could lead to a transfer from consumers to producers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to the analysis of the relationship between Islamic banking development and economic growth using a sample of 52 countries with data covering the period 1990-2010. The results illustrate that, notwithstanding its relatively small size compared to the economy and the overall size of the financial system, Islamic banking is positively associated with economic growth, even after controlling for various determinants of growth. The main channels of transmission include capital accumulation and improved financial inclusion, in particular a better access to deposits. Many Islamic countries that currently suffer from low growth should develop this segment of their banking sector further, through modernizing the legislative, regulatory, and infrastructural environment for instance. Similarly, non-Islamic countries that adopt some practices from Islamic banking to their banking regulations may help spur growth as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Controlling for a range of macro-economic and institutional country characteristics and accounting for endogenous relationships between the main variables of interest, we find a robust and sizeable positive effect of post materialism on stock markets. Legal, political and democratic institutions also promote the development of stock markets. Furthermore, we find that the effect of post materialism consists of a direct effect and a substantial indirect effect that runs via several types of institutions.

While income inequality stagnated or slightly rose over the past two generations, consumption inequality in fact declined. These antagonistic trends are likely due to better access of poorer households to financial markets as well as the gradual expansion of the welfare state.

The output measures were obtained through the answers to a questionnaire following a mock online exercise: one revealed the amount of personal information participants were willing to disclose, and the other whether they noticed a privacy policy link. The nudges appeared as changes in the design of a mock search engine (e.g. including an anthropomorphic character, highlighting prior browsing history or changing the look-and-feel to convey greater informality). The nudges did not lead to differences in the amount of personal information disclosed, but did affect whether participants noticed the privacy link or not. Socio-demographic factors were relevant. Compared to younger participants, older participants were less likely to reveal personal information but more likely to notice the privacy policy link. Men were more likely to reveal personal information than women, and more likely to notice the privacy policy link. Finally, significant differences were found between all countries. Participants from Italy chose to reveal least personal information (followed by those in Poland, Germany and the UK), and participants from the UK were significantly less likely to notice the privacy policy link. The implications for policy are that disclosure of personal information is resilient to small changes in the web environment, but this is not the case for awareness of a privacy policy link. Moreover, the fact that age, gender, and country of residence are relevant suggests that differentiated policy approaches depending on the target population may be warranted.","[Rodriguez-Priego, Nuria; van Bavel, Rene; Monteleone, Shara] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain",,"van Bavel, R (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",rene.van-bavel@ec.europa.eu,"Rodriguez-Priego, Nuria/ABG-4342-2021; Rodriguez-Priego, Nuria/ABD-9397-2021","Rodriguez-Priego, Nuria/0000-0002-4841-0135;",,,,,41,9,9,1,42,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The paper works on three analyses: the cycle turning points are identified; the main features of credit and business cycles are documented; and in both cycles the causal relationship is assessed. We find differences in the features of the business and credit cycle phases, which lead to a scant degree of synchronization over time. The lack of synchronization might be a sign that the cyclic interaction could be non-contemporaneous. Our results reveal that there is causation. A significant lagged relationship between business and credit cycles is found; specifically, fluctuations of the business cycle lead fluctuations of the credit to non-financial corporations and a lag exists with respect to the fluctuations of the credit to households. We also examine episodes of credit boom and credit crunch. In the period 1970-2014, Spanish credit booms did not involve deeper business cycle contractions and credit crunches were not associated with deeper and longer business cycle contractions. These differences are related with the great importance of the real estate sector in Spain.","[Sala-Rios, Merce; Torres-Sole, Teresa; Farre-Perdiguer, Mariona] Univ Lleida, Dept Econ Aplicada, 73 Campus Cappont, Lleida 25001, Spain; [Sala-Rios, Merce; Torres-Sole, Teresa; Farre-Perdiguer, Mariona] Univ Lleida, Dept Appl Econ, Lleida, Spain",Universitat de Lleida; Universitat de Lleida,"Sala-Rios, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Econ Aplicada, 73 Campus Cappont, Lleida 25001, Spain.;Sala-Rios, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Appl Econ, Lleida, Spain.",mercesa@econap.udl.cat,"Torres-Solé, Teresa/A-6130-2016; Sala-Rios, Mercè/A-6978-2016; Farré-Perdiguer, Mariona/K-5781-2016","Torres-Solé, Teresa/0000-0002-2861-5213; Sala-Rios, Mercè/0000-0001-7634-5951; Farré-Perdiguer, Mariona/0000-0002-2105-1101",,,,,66,6,7,1,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

We find that improved judicial efficiency is associated with higher levels of corporate cash holdings. This finding supports the managerial-fear hypothesis, where managers consider improvements in judicial efficiency as increasing the probability of bankruptcy and loss of their jobs, responding to this fear by hoarding extra cash as a buffer against bankruptcy. As added support to this conclusion, we find that the positive impact of judicial efficiency on cash holdings further increases for riskier firms (e.g., firms that are smaller, have less collateral, have greater research and development expenditures, and are faster-growing). The results also show that strengthening creditor rights increases corporate cash holdings, subject to the availability of efficient enforcement through the judicial systems. Our results are robust when using different estimation techniques, alternative measures of cash holdings and judicial efficiency, changing the sample period, and different samples, such as excluding countries with a higher density of observations.

The proposed AMH copula ML estimation is compared with the well-known bivariate ML estimation and Heckman's two-step estimation. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to compare their performance in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) depending on the following 2 conditions: (i) whether the imposed distributional assumption is correct, and (ii) whether some regressors of the participation and outcome equation are correlated. The results of the experiments show that the estimation results for the proposed method can be better than those of the two well-known methods, particularly when the imposed distributional assumption is incorrect and some regressors of the two equations are correlated. Hence, the proposed method can be a practically useful alternative for the sample selection model.","[Song, Hosin] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Song, H (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",hsong@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,3,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The weighted aggregate-efficiency technique, based on a group-wise heterogeneous subsampling bootstrap approach, is employed to compare efficiency levels during the periods 2007-2009 and 2010-2013. This technique allows for heterogeneity in environmental and regulatory conditions between the two periods while assuming homogeneity within each period. Our results reveal that the banking sector experienced a significant efficiency improvement post-conflict even with unprecedented branch expansion. The findings, therefore, controvert the mainstream view that bank efficiency declined with rapid industry expansion. Further, we conclude that geographical expansion of the banking sector is a viable and effective policy tool to achieve broad-based and inclusive growth for emerging economies like Sri Lanka, particularly in a period of post-conflict recovery.

The 2008-2009 crisis has forced a deleveraging process, leading to a prolonged recovery due to further demand cuts. The protracted economic problems and the inadequate management of economic policy in the EU increased social discontent that may have eventually contributed to Brexit. The short-and long-run impacts of the decision are difficult to judge, given that the details of the exit process cannot yet be known. Currently, there is a consensus among analysts that the negative economic effects could be greater in the UK in the short term. However, in the longer term, the UK may benefit from a potentially more flexible economic policy framework, while socio-political and economic risks are imposed on the European economy by the secondary effects due to its structural problems and the uncertain future of its institutional system. As a small open economy, Hungary highly depends on the economic performance of its foreign trade partners. We have found that the economic impact of Brexit on Hungary remains moderate. Among the direct channels, the foreign trade channel may be the dominant. Meanwhile, the reduction of EU funds and remittances will affect the Hungarian growth only modestly. Hungary's vulnerability has improved substantially since the 2008-2009 crisis. Accordingly, potential second-round effects of Brexit may remain subdued and be mitigated through substantial room for manoeuvre for economic policies.","[Varadi, Balazs H.; Varnai, Timea; Virag, Bamabs] Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Budapest, Hungary",,"Váradi, BH (通讯作者)，Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Budapest, Hungary.",varadib@mnb.hu; varnait@mnb.hu; viragb@mnb.hu,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,,,,,25,1,1,0,30,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The technology's ability to cut costs depends on a use for it being discovered and the patentee has the option of trying to discover the use before licensing the technology to the firms. Should the patentee try? To answer this question, we model the interaction between the patentee and the firms as a game in extensive form. The first move in the game belongs to the patentee, deciding whether to carry a trial. Next, there is a licensing stage, followed by Cournot competition involving licensees and nonlicensees. We show that if a failure leads to the belief that the technology is most likely useless to the firms, then not trying to discover the use is optimal, even if a trial is free of pecuniary costs.

Applying the model to 21 countries, we investigate the 29 percent drop in world trade in manufactures during the period 2008-2009. A shift in final spending away from tradable sectors, largely caused by declines in durables investment efficiency, accounts for most of the collapse in trade relative to GDP.

First, a Rosen-Roback model is employed to estimate implicit values of amenities including climate, clean air and other natural attributes, which are used to generate QOL indices. Second, QOL, human capital represented by the share of college graduates, and their interaction serve as key variables in the wage growth model. An instrumental variable approach and location fixed effects are used to address endogeneity of human capital and control for location-specific unobservable characteristics. Results suggest that human capital and QOL significantly contribute to economic growth and the growth effects are even larger in nonmetropolitan counties. Importantly, we find that the effect of human capital on growth is larger in high-QOL counties and QOL enhances the effect of human capital on growth. Our results provide empirical support for community development strategies through providing utility-enhancing amenities that improve QOL and retain human capital.","[Fan, Qin] Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Dept Econ, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.; Liang, Jiaochen] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",California State University System; California State University Fresno; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Fan, Q (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Dept Econ, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",qfan@csufresno.edu,,"Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X","Shuster Family Research Fellowship at the Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno; Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno","Shuster Family Research Fellowship at the Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno; Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno","This work is supported by the Shuster Family Research Fellowship at the Craig School of Business, California State University, Fresno.

In this regard, we extend the findings of non-empirical studies dealing with this issue for the case of African countries and complement the literature on the methodological side by investigating this relationship using wavelet analysis. This frequency approach is appropriate, as it takes into account investor heterogeneity and the time-variant characteristic of the studied relationship. Further, it explains the lead-lag relationship between the studied series. First, we observe that credit and commodities are strongly related over long timescales, suggesting that the credit market reacts strongly to long-term change in commodity markets and thus tends to be sensitive to persistent commodity shocks. Second, for medium and short timescales, the interaction is high and significant only during periods of turmoil. In terms of the lead-lag relationship, our results also show that the commodity market causes fluctuations in the credit market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An application of this methodology to the 2011-2015 EUR/CHF minimum exchange rate regime shows that the Swiss National Bank presumably intervened only at (or very close to) the floor level of EUR/CHF 1.20 and not at a level significantly above that boundary. Hence, contrary to previous studies, the reported results accord with the predictions of the Krugman (1991) target zone model about the behavior of exchange rates, allowing investors to gain insights about the central bank's policy function in extraordinary monetary situations and with important consequences for the descriptive validity of theoretical one-sided target zone models.","[Hertrich, Markus] Univ Basel, Dept Finance, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland; [Hertrich, Markus] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Basel; Deutsche Bank,"Hertrich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Finance, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland.;Hertrich, M (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",markus.hertrich@unibas.ch,,"Hertrich, Markus/0000-0001-7239-6137",,,,,27,2,2,1,6,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We study an axiom capturing a liberal non-interfering view of society, the Weak Harm Principle, whose roots can be traced back to John Stuart Mill. We show that liberal views of individual autonomy and freedom can provide consistent foundations for welfare judgements. In particular, a liberal non-interfering approach can help to adjudicate some fundamental distributive issues relative to intergenerational justice. However, a strong relation is established between liberal views of individual autonomy and non-interference, and egalitarian principles in the Rawlsian tradition.","[Veneziani, Roberto] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Glasgow; Waseda University,"Veneziani, R (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England.",r.veneziani@qmul.ac.uk,,"Lombardi, Michele/0000-0002-8613-053X",JSPS KAKENHI,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Special thanks go to Geir Asheim, Francois Maniquet, Marco Mariotti, Peter Hammond, Martin Cripps (the Editor in charge) and an anonymous referee, whose comments and suggestions have led to substantial improvements in the article.

The results suggest that higher (lower) aggregate uncertainty increases (reduces) non-response to the survey. This effect is statistically and economically significant. Therefore, the assumption that individual ECB's SPF data are missing at random may not be appropriate. Moreover, the forecasters that perceive more individual uncertainty seem to have a lower likelihood of replying to the survey. Consequently, measures of uncertainty computed from individual ECB's SPF data could be biased downwards.","[Lopez-Perez, Victor] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"López-Pérez, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena, Spain.",victor.lopez@upct.es,,,,,,,36,3,4,0,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 19,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201625.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-25,0.0,,,47,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EA0PB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386288300001,0

If incentive mechanisms must satisfy conditions of robust coalition-proofness as well as robust incentive compatibility, the participants' contributions to public good provision can only depend on the level of the public good that is provided and that level can only depend on the population shares of people favouring one level over another. For a public good that comes as a single indivisible unit the outcome depends on whether or not the share of votes in favour of provision exceeds a specified threshold. With more provision levels for the public good, more complicated mechanisms can be used but they still involve the counting of votes rather than any measurement of the participants' willingness to pay. The article thus provides a foundation for the use of voting mechanisms.","[Bierbrauer, Felix J.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Hellwig, Martin F.] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of Cologne; Max Planck Society,"Bierbrauer, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",,"Bierbrauer, Felix J/L-4129-2015",,,,,,43,15,18,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Those who are forced to sell typically must take action within the span of a day, while those who are providing liquidity do not face similar urgency. Indeed, the flurry of activity and increased volatility of prices during the liquidity shocks might actually reduce the speed with which many liquidity providers come to the market. To analyze these dynamics, we build upon previous agent-based models of financial markets, and specifically the Preis et. al (Europhys Lett 75(3):510-516, 2006) model, to develop an order-book model with heterogeneity in trader decision cycles. The model demonstrates an adherence to important stylized facts such as a leptokurtic distribution of returns, decay of autocorrelations over moderate to long time lags, and clustering volatility. Consistent with empirical analysis of recent market events, we demonstrate the impact of heterogeneous decision cycles on market resilience and the stochastic properties of market prices.","[Bookstaber, Richard] US Treasury, Off Financial Res, Washington, DC USA; [Foley, Michael D.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT USA; [Tivnan, Brian F.] Mitre Corp, 7525 Colshire Dr, Mclean, VA 22102 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; University of Vermont; MITRE Corporation,"Tivnan, BF (通讯作者)，Mitre Corp, 7525 Colshire Dr, Mclean, VA 22102 USA.",rbookstaber@gmail.com; mikefoley37@gmail.com; btivnan@mitre.org,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We develop a simultaneous three equation model in order to investigate the existence of a 'virtuous circle' between industries' R&D, share of product innovators and export market shares. We investigate empirically - at the industry level - three key relationships affecting the dynamics of innovation and export performance: first, the capacity of firms to translate their R&D efforts in new products; second, the role of innovation as a determinant of export market shares; third, the export success as a driver of new R&D efforts. The model is tested for 38 manufacturing and service sectors of six European countries over three time periods, from 1995 to 2010. The model effectively accounts for the dynamics of R&D efforts, innovation and international performance of European industries. Moreover, important differences across countries emerge when we split our sample into a Northern group - Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom - and a Southern group - France, Italy and Spain. We find that the 'virtuous circle' between innovation and competitiveness holds for Northern economies only, while Southern industries fail to translate innovation efforts into export success.","[Guarascio, Dario] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy; [Pianta, Mario] Univ Urbino, Ctr Linceo Interdisciplinare Beniamino Segre, Rome, Italy; [Bogliacino, Francesco] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Urbino; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Guarascio, D (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy.",dario.guarascio@sssup.it,"Guarascio, Dario/AAF-4189-2019","Bogliacino, Francesco/0000-0001-8874-8846; Guarascio, Dario/0000-0002-2748-6472",,,,,68,21,22,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A network model,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTERACTION AND COORDINATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Business angel investment; Trust; Reciprocity; Agent-based simulation,CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; COMMITMENT; EVOLUTION,"Trust is an important determinant of start-up financing. In a simple agent-based model it is determined what the best trusting strategy is for a collective of investors and whether it is rational for an individual investor to deviate from this collective optimum. Trust depends on a measure of social distance and is the precondition for investment. Trust increases and decreases based on whether an investor is satisfied with the interest payments received from an entrepreneur. If an investor is dissatisfied, he terminates the relation with the entrepreneur. For assessing the quality of their own investments, investors communicate with other investors in a network-like structure. I find that, as a collective, it is best for investors to compare their returns critically in order to identify unproductive entrepreneurs, but to be tolerant regarding existing links to entrepreneurs in order not to terminate profitable relations because of minor productivity drops. However, it is optimal for an individual investor to deviate from this strategy and to be less easily disappointed, but to decrease trust in larger steps. In a sense, an individual investor can free ride on the others' critical assessment. If all investors behave according to this latter strategy, too many unproductive firms remain in the market and the average investor's return is lower than in the collective optimum.","[Klabunde, Anna] Max Planck Inst Demog Res, Konrad Zuse Str 1, D-18057 Rostock, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Klabunde, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Demog Res, Konrad Zuse Str 1, D-18057 Rostock, Germany.",klabunde@demogr.mpg.de,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,74,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Survey replies reveal a low percentage of firms changing prices with frequency higher than annual and staggering of price changes during the year. As to firms' reactions to unexpected shocks, prices appear to adjust sluggishly to cost shocks with asymmetries in price adjustment across positive and negative shocks. Adjustments to increases in costs appear speedier than those to reductions in demand. The data confirm a result found for other countries: the existence of cross-sectional variations in price setting strategies and in the extent to which prices are adjusted in reaction to unexpected shocks. The results suggest a positive association between, on the one hand, product market competition and, on the other hand, state-dependent pricing, frequent price changes and the likelihood of a price adjustment following an adverse demand shock.","[Nicolitsas, Daphne] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Gallos Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece",University of Crete,"Nicolitsas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Gallos Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece.",nikolitsa@uoc.gr,"Nicolitsas, Daphne/ABI-2845-2020","Nicolitsas, Daphne/0000-0003-3903-5027; Nicolitsas, Daphne/0000-0003-1397-5387",,,,,30,1,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The idea is to identify equilibrium prices for the housing market given the prerequisite that a tenant can buy any house on the housing market, including the one that he is currently possessing, or continue renting the house he is currently occupying. The main contribution is the identification of an individually rational, equilibrium selecting, and group non -manipulable price mechanism in a restricted preference domain that contains almost all preference profiles.

We compare alternative institutions that allocate enforcement rights to the different parties to a credit transaction: either lenders, borrowers, or judges.

In our model agents choose their peers and have to pay a connection cost for each member added to the group. After groups are formed, each agent selects a public project to make a costly contribution to, and all members of the group experience the benefits of these contributions. Since agents differ in how much they value one project relative to the other, the group's preferences affect the generated profile of public goods. We characterize mutually optimal groups, groups that are optimal for all their members. When contribution costs are low relative to connection costs, mutually optimal groups must be sufficiently homogeneous. As contribution costs increase relative to connection costs, agents desire more connections, which in turn raises the risk of free riding. Extreme peers are then more appealing, since they are more willing to contribute, and polarization arises. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We conduct a critical review of the overconfidence literature to bridge this gap, identify future research directions for the study of overconfidence in real estate markets, and suggest strategies to handle technical issues, such as the robustness of overconfidence measurement and data availability.

Commons tried to save capitalism by making it good. His career was characterized by a sustained attempt to reduce social inequality by promoting collective action. Thanks to his proximity to the terrain, Commons often found himself close to authentic examples of corruption. Indeed, in his published works, corruption was treated exclusively from this perspective. His analysis reveals that collective action is not only the cause, but also the consequence of corruption, and that, in addition, the struggle against corruption is dependent on collective action for its success. I argue that Commons's position is diametrically opposed to the theses developed later by Nathaniel Leff and Samuel Huntington. For Commons, the main issue is not that there is too much control over individual actions, but that there is too little.","[Broda, Philippe] Novancia Business Sch, Dept Econ, Econ, Paris, France",,"Broda, P (通讯作者)，Novancia Business Sch, Dept Econ, Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,55,1,1,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We established a theoretical model and derived a theoretical mechanism from this model revealing two distinctive patterns of the impacts determined by the profitability of financial derivatives: the impacts of financial innovation and systematic risk on banks' stability in China are linear under the circumstances of a positive expected risk premium of financial derivatives; conversely, the impacts can be linear, U-shaped or cubic when the expected risk premium is negative. We make three propositions to analyse the patterns and conditions of these impacts in detail. In the empirical analysis, we do not focus only on the banking industry but also on individual commercial banks. The empirical results demonstrate that the impact of financial innovation on both the banking industry's and most individual commercial banks' stability are U-shaped, and the impact of systematic risk on the banking industry's and on only one commercial bank's stability are significantly linear, which confirms certain conditions mentioned in the theoretical propositions.

To contribute to this effort, we use data from the 2008-10 survey of China's high-tech firms, conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, to estimate the determinants of Chinese firm outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). In our analysis, the primary independent variables include high-tech intensity, human capital acquisition, and institutional factors. We also controlled for various firm characteristics such as firm age, total value of fixed assest, and firm ownership. Estimation from our fixed-effects model uncovers a number interesting patterns in OFDI outcomes. Most notable among the significant determinants of OFDI, the number of Chinese returnees employed by a firm seems to be more important than tax reduction policies. Further, the influence of the Chinese returnees have a stronger effect on non-state-controlled firms than they do for state-controlled firms. This finding is intuitive, because the Chinese returnees who were trained in the West have an understanding of product markets, labor markets, financial markets, language and business culture, and trade laws in both China and the West. Their unique skill sets and knowledge appear to serve as an important catalyst in the growth of OFDI and internationalization by Chinese firms.","[Chen, Zhao] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Fang, Tony] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, Arts & Adm Bldg,Room AA-3077, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Fang, Tony] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Fang, Tony] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Fudan University; Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Toronto; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Chen, Z (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhaochen@fudan.edu.cn; TFANG@mun.ca,,,Stephen Jarislowsky Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); National Natural Science Funds of China (NSFC) [71203143],Stephen Jarislowsky Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Natural Science Funds of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to thank Kerri Neil for her research assistance on the case studies.

This is a highly topical issue, given that many industrialized countries are increasingly becoming service economies and firms become increasingly more globalized. In an analysis of rich firm level data for France we find evidence that the availability of services in the home country indeed has a positive impact on firms' decisions to become multinationals. This is robust to endogeneity concerns. The result can be interpreted in a simple set-up where the local availability of business services improves firm efficiency and, hence, allows firms to overcome sunk costs of investing abroad more easily.","[Goerg, Holger] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Jabbour, Liza] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Goerg, Holger] Aarhus Univ, Tuborg Ctr Globalisat & Firms, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Jabbour, Liza] Univ Nottingham, Kiel Inst World Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jabbour, Liza] Univ Nottingham, Globalisat & Econ Policy Ctr GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Birmingham; Aarhus University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",holger.goerg@ifw-kiel.de,,"Jabbour, Liza/0000-0003-4262-2919",,,,,26,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using implications from a standard Ramsey growth model augmented for anticipation and implementation effects, we pool cross section and time series data to estimate ex post the effects of trade liberalization on a set of Arabic Southern Mediterranean Partner countries (SMPCs). We find significant and robust evidence for positive effects on major macro variables and discuss the appropriate policies. Second, we review a number of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies which aimed at assessing the macroeconomic impacts for the same countries ex ante. CGE projections are very much at odds with the econometric findings and the biases seem to be systematic for all macro variables. Third, we use ANOVA techniques to identify possible shortcomings both with respect to design and target country of the CGE study. We find that even well-designed CGE studies targeted to an average type of country do not seem to yield reliable results. Overall, our analysis suggests that there is no sound statistical evidence to believe that CGE analysis has been useful in assessing the macroeconomic effects of trade liberalization in the Mediterranean. But we find considerable econometric evidence to support the view that free trade policies have enhanced growth in the MENA region. (C) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling.

The empirical results show that, by applying long and short strategies during the bubble formation and a short strategy after the bubble burst, it not only produces returns that are significantly greater than buy and hold strategies, but also produces greater wealth compared with TA strategies without trading rules.

The main purpose of this study is to simulate the optimal extraction policy of coal mining with and without the internalization of the environmental and social monetary costs that occur in the Mining District (located in the central part of the Department of El Cesar) using discrete dynamic programming (backward recursion, discrete state Markov decision model and Bellman equation). Results indicate that the private optimal of the overproduction policy for the terminal phase of the resource extraction program can be reduced once the negative externalities produced by mining practices are internalized into the cost function of the mining investment companies in Colombia. This means that if there is an increase in the total cost of extraction to offset the environmental and social impacts generated, the negative externalities would be less than or equal to the current level. Likewise, profits would continue being positive for the mining firms at the Mining District. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Complexity seems to be broad enough to accommodate very different positions and it has been seen as a unifying approach for evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian streams. This pluralism is reflected in the fact that many authors that draw upon complexity ideas from neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary theory, make contrasting policy recommendations in terms of if it should be vertical or horizontal or if it should promote bottom-up process or direct interventions. This is possible because the complexity approach has not yet been fully developed and its limits are still somewhat blurred. In this paper, we propose to explore this idea by identifying the theoretical backgrounds and the policy recommendations of different groups of neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary authors. We propose that backgrounds focused on different attributes of complexity lead to different development policies recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We allow for a structural break when testing for a break in persistence to avoid a change in the stochastic properties of prices being confounded by an unaccounted-for deterministic shift in the price series. We find that coal prices are trend stationary throughout their evolution and that oil prices change from stationarity to non-stationarity in the decade between the late 1960s to late 1970s. The result on gas prices is ambiguous. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for a possible structural shift when testing for breaks in persistence, while being robust to the exact date of the structural break. Based on our analysis we caution against viewing long-run energy commodity prices as being non-stationary and conclude in favor of modeling commodity market fundamentals as stationary, meaning that speculative storage will tend to have a dampening effect on prices. We also cannot reject that long-run prices of coal and, with some hesitation, gas follow a Hotelling-type rule. In contrast, we reject the Hotelling rule for oil prices since the late 1960s/early 1970s. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The period under study includes episodes of volatility and instability in financial markets, incorporating the Global Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis. This implies a challenge in portfolio optimization strategies since the methodologies are restricted to the assignment of positive weights. We have taken for asset allocation the daily returns with an estimation window equal to 1 year and we hold portfolio assets for another year. This article attempts to influence the discussion over whether the naive diversification proves to be an effective strategy as opposed to portfolio optimization models. For that, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of 15 strategies for asset allocation in the Ibex 35, before and after of the Global Financial Crisis. Our results suggest that a large number of strategies outperform to the 1/N rule and to the Ibex 35 index in terms of return, Sharpe ratio and lower VaR and CVaR. The mean-variance portfolio of Markowitz with short-sale constraints is the only strategy that renders a Sharpe ratio statistically different from Ibex 35 index in the 2001-2007 and 2008-2014 time periods.","[Adame, Victor M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez-Rodriguez, Fernando] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sosvilla-Rivero, S (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",sosvilla@ccee.ucm.es,"Fernández-Rodríguez, Fernando/ABC-9584-2021; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Fernandez-Rodriguez, Fernando/0000-0002-8808-9286; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640",Government of Spain [ECO2011-23189],Government of Spain(Spanish Government),This work is supported by the Government of Spain [grant number ECO2011-23189].,,69,3,3,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We provide empirical evidence documenting the existence of such a trade-off in the period characterized by the financial crisis and by the sovereign debt crisis. Then, we conclude that the intense fiscal rules that have been introduced in the Eurozone after the emergence of the debt crisis can reduce the capacity of national governments to deal with asymmetric shocks and can be incompatible with either free capital mobility and/or financial stability.

The objective of the oeuf-lait-orange (eggs-milk-oranges) (OLO) program is to reduce the incidence of prematurity and low birth weight by providing a specific food basket and nutritional guidance to pregnant women in situations of poverty. Our identification strategy exploits exogenous variations in access to the program caused by the progressive implementation of the program. Using detailed administrative birth records for over 1.5 million newborns, we find that the program significantly increased the birth weight of treated children by 69.8 g and reduced the probability of low birth weight by 3.6 percentage points. W also find that prematurity decreased by 2.2 percentage points and gestation increased by 1.5 days, but these effects are generally not significant.

Time-varying parameters will be estimated for nonparametric dependence by using copula functions with United States stock market data. We compare our model with Kim et al.'s (2016) linear time-varying regression (LTVR) with DCC-GARCH in the ex-post volatility forecast evaluations. Empirical study shows that our proposed volatility models are more efficient than the LTVR model. We also use the superior predictive ability and the reality check for data snooping. Evidence can be found supporting that our proposed model with copula functions provides superior forecasts for volatility over the LTVR model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Financial markets have been dominated by extraordinary central bank policies that were created to deal with challenging market conditions reflecting heightened risk aversion and illiquidity. Markets in the future will have some characteristics that look more like the market conditions observed in the pre-crisis period, which I call the new-old normal' and other conditions that differ from the past, which I call the new-new normal'. I first review what happened during the financial crisis in terms of developments in three asset classes, equities, fixed income and currencies, to place the forward-looking view in proper context. Then the transition period from the quantitative easing (QE) era of exceptional monetary policy to post-QE markets is discussed. Post-transition, we will see some features of the post-QE world that will resemble pre-crisis market conditions, the new-old normal' with higher policy interest rates, wider cross-country interest differentials, lower cross-asset return correlations and a resurgence of the importance of cross-country differences in fundamentals in international investing. However, some features of the post-QE investment environment will be unlike anything observed in the past: the new-new normal' with reduced liquidity and more days of exceptionally large volatility and asset price moves due to regulatory effects resulting in a reduced ability of market-makers to provide inventory buffers for counterparties and electronic trading venues that shut down trading in high volatility periods; low inflation; flatter yield curves; and emerging markets providing less opportunity for diversification gains as they converge to developed financial market characteristics.","[Melvin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Melvin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mmelvin@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The ECB statute is consistent with a view of the economy that was predominant in the 1990s, that postulates a very limited role for discretional policies in managing the business cycle. The ECB had therefore to stretch its mandate in several occasions, during the crisis, to avoid severe outcomes. It was unable to avoid a slow but inexorable slide of the Eurozone towards deflation and a liquidity trap. To restore robust growth, fiscal policy should be used, and institutions should be redesigned away from the Berlin-Washington Consensus framework that shaped the Maastricht Treaty. Better rules for fiscal governance and a wider ECB mandate are proposed.","[Saraceno, Francesco] OFCE Sci Po, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75007 Paris, France; [Saraceno, Francesco] LUISS SEP, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy",,"Saraceno, F (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75007 Paris, France.;Saraceno, F (通讯作者)，LUISS SEP, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",francesco.saraceno@sciencespo.fr,,"Saraceno, Francesco/0000-0003-0121-4329",ILO,ILO,Financial support from the ILO is gratefully acknowledged.,,50,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The purpose of this article is to indicate the factors affecting growth of managed futures transactions. Another research goal is to answer the question: Does the increase of wealth on a global scale affect the value of the managed futures transactions? The article will also present short-term forecasts of the transactions on the managed futures market for the years 2015-2017. The forecasts which will be constructed are meant to present possible scenarios of the market's further development. Evolution of the alternative investment segment leads to development of those categories, which fulfil the expectations of market participants and meet the requirement and expiration of the remaining investments which do not attract investors and are no longer accepted by them.","[Sokolowska, Ewelina] Univ Gdansk, Dept Corp Finance, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Sokolowska, E (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Dept Corp Finance, Gdansk, Poland.",ewelina.sokolowska@ug.edu.pl,"Sokolowska, Ewelina Edyta/C-6173-2015","Sokolowska, Ewelina Edyta/0000-0002-0470-9530",,,,,38,0,0,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The findings strongly support an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita CO2 emission (PCE) and urban development. However, the realization of this relationship depends on stringent governmental policy interventions. The regression analysis in this paper shows that city size is positively correlated with CO2 emission efficiency, but negatively correlated with PCE. This result suggests that population restrictions in large cities tend to increase CO2 emission. It is also shown that regional development programs are likely to encourage economic activities in regions with low CO2 emission efficiency and may have significant environmental consequences in the future.","[Wu, Jianxin; Wu, Yanrui; Wang, Bing] Jinan Univ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Res, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianxin; Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",Jinan University; University of Western Australia,"Wu, YR (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Res, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wu, YR (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia.",yanrui.wu@uwa.edu.au,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459","National Natural Science Foundation [1333007, 71473105]; National Social Science Foundation [15ZDA054]; Jinan University's Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Project [13JNIRESD01]","National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation; Jinan University's Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Project","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation [grant number 1333007], [grant number 71473105]; National Social Science Foundation [grant number 15ZDA054]; Jinan University's Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Project [grant number 13JNIRESD01]",,38,5,5,4,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

An important empirical question is whether the Chinese energy firms tend to misallocate resources due to growing free cash flows. In this paper, we test whether they make some sub-optimal investment decisions following the well-established free cash flow problem in the finance literature, originally identified by Jensen (1986) for the US oil sector. Using a dynamic panel model for the period 2001-2012 for the Chinese energy-related public listed firms, we find evidence supporting the free cash flow hypothesis, suggesting overinvestment problems in the Chinese energy sector. In addition, we observe that firm size and corporate governance structure are important determinants of the Chinese energy firms' investment decisions.

These studies predict a premium on the matching of mission preferences between a worker and employer. This paper uses data from the Dutch LISS panel to examine this prediction for government workers. Results show that government workers report higher satisfaction with the type of work they do when their political preferences match those of the political parties in office as compared to when their political preferences do not match.

He is internationally known as the founding father of the theory of monetary circuit. His contributions to economic theory went beyond the circuit, especially in the early part of his career. They included both other theoretical areas (for example, a critical review of Walras's general equilibrium model) and the analysis of the 'uneven development' of the Italian economy. Even his approach to 'circuitism' was quite original and cannot be reduced to a special branch of post-Keynesianism. This introduction to the symposium on 'The Economics of Augusto Graziani' highlights some key points of his heretical thinking, and gives a quick summary of the papers that follow.","[Bellofiore, Riccardo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Passarella, Marco Veronese] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bergamo; University of Leeds,"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",,,"Veronese Passarella, Marco/0000-0001-7652-5952",,,,,27,3,3,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Privately informed managers exert surplus enhancing effort that generates an externality on the rival. Asymmetric information on imperfectly correlated shocks creates a two-way distortion of efforts under strategic substitutability in effort and a double downward distortion under strategic complementarity in effort. In the first case, as with contracts for R&D activity or small contractual spillovers for quantity and price competition, increasing the correlation of types reduces the polarization of contracts and the differentials in managerial compensations between efficient and inefficient managers. In the second case, as with large contractual spillovers, the opposite occurs.","[Cella, Michela] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, Milan, Italy; [Etro, Federico] Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fondamenta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Cella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, Milan, Italy.",michela.cella@unimib.it; federico.etro@unive.it,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Based on a novel researcher-level panel database that includes a control group not affected by the policy change, we find no evidence that the new infrastructure resulted in an increase in start-up companies by university researchers.

In general, the results show a high degree of persistence in the series along with a component of non-linear behaviour. In general, if we assume uncorrelated errors, non-linearities are observed in both nominal and real prices, but this hypothesis is rejected in favour of linear models for the log-transformation of the data.

Examining a balanced panel of 1143 municipalities shows that employment levels increase in the two pre-electoral quarters and drop sharply in the two quarters following elections. Further results are consistent with the cycles being generated by incumbents' attempts to increase their chances of re-election. Cycles are stronger in sectors that incumbents are more able to influence, and when they expect stronger electoral competition. Evidence suggests that these cycles are detrimental to development.

The response of growth to savings is first estimated using instruments to generate exogenous variation in savings rates. The residual variation in growth that is not driven by savings is then used as an instrument to estimate the effect of growth on savings. The estimates show that the spectacular saving rates in the Asian miracle economies have been fuelled by growth, and not the other way around.","[Madsen, Jakob B.; Mamun, Iqtiar] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Madsen, JB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",Jakob.Madsen@monash.edu,,"Madsen, Jakob/0000-0002-4952-3043",,,,,64,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We investigate whether or not these new rules led to an increase in the Medicaid exit rate among enrollees using state administrative data from Georgia. We do this by comparing the exit rate for children enrolled in Medicaid whose first coverage recertification occurs just after implementation of the DRA (which we refer to as a high impact first recertification) with those whose first recertification occurs just prior (which we refer to as a low impact first recertification). Our analysis suggests that children in the high-impact first recertification group were about 2 percentage points more likely to exit Medicaid than those in the low-impact group. Furthermore, these additional exits occurred in racial and ethnic groups more likely to be citizens than noncitizens and prereform estimates suggest that there were very few (roughly 0.10%) noncitizen Medicaid enrollees to begin with. Taken together, our results suggest that the DRA-enhanced citizenship verification rules led to an increase in Medicaid disenrollment, and thus a reduction in coverage, among citizens.","[Marton, James] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Snyder, Angela; Zhou, Mei] Georgia State Univ, Georgia Hlth Policy Ctr, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Zhou, M (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Georgia Hlth Policy Ctr, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",marton@gsu.edu; angiesnyder@gsu.edu; mzhou1@gsu.edu,"Snyder, Angie/HLW-3551-2023; Marton, Johann/H-2668-2012","Snyder, Angela/0000-0002-5149-6355",,,,,24,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

For this purpose, we built a general equilibrium heterogeneous-agent model capable of exploring the relationship between fiscal policy variables and the endogenous cross-section distribution of income and wealth. Using a utilitarian welfare criterion, results show that different strategies yield different outcomes. Despite the positive welfare gains observed, transition costs affect all episodes and are determinant in sorting among the welfare-enhancing strategies. Our results confirm the superiority of adjustments partially based on the reduction of unproductive expenditures over those based on tax raises or on the reduction of social transfer. Welfare is further enhanced when consolidation strategies involve an equilibrated mix between expenditure and transfer cuts and tax increases, because debt consolidation processes mostly or exclusively based on social transfers cuts have a strong negative effect on welfare inequality. Moreover, shock volatility and persistency (also shaping inequality) help explain different results across countries: under high income inequality, consolidation processes are expected to yield smaller inequality effects on welfare, whereas a worse consumption-leisure trade-off may arise.","[Viegas, Miguel] Univ Aveiro, DEGEI, GOVCOPP, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Paula] CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Paula] Univ Porto, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Viegas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, DEGEI, GOVCOPP, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",mlbv@ua.pt,,"Viegas, Miguel/0000-0003-1390-4992; Ribeiro, Ana Paula/0000-0002-8974-7420",Portuguese Public Funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [PEst-OE/EGE/UI4105/2014],Portuguese Public Funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia),"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees, the editor of this journal, Vincenzo Quadrini, Ricardo M.

An incentive-feasible trading protocol is derived to minimize the welfare loss subject to frictions rendering money essential. The welfare cost of inflation under this optimal protocol is the lower bound over all pairwise trading protocols of monetary exchange. In general, the first-best is not implementable, even under the Friedman's rule, patient agents and the optimal mechanism. Thus, the lower bound depends on fundamentals like preferences and technology. Finally, I estimate the irreducible cost of 10% inflation with the U.S. data from 1900 to 2000.

At ages beyond infancy, the correlation between cognitive outcomes and marital surplus is robust to the inclusion of the parental characteristics that generate the match, suggesting that the correlation represents effects of the match itself. High marital surplus is associated with assortative mating on education and age, suggesting complementarity in parental inputs in child production. Our results suggest that marital surplus is an important input for child quality above and beyond its indirect effects on marital stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such issues are central to assessment and targeting of policies such as social welfare and taxation. We apply the ratio to 21,144 South African households. South Africa employs various taxation-funded social grants and subsidized services. A central question is how such transfers affect real household income and consumption. We find that the constitution of social transfers as a function of tax adjusted earned income significantly augments household buying power. Furthermore, we hypothesize and find a negative curvilinear shape which has implications for design of taxation and welfare. This constitution and distribution of this ratio may be useful for international benchmarking and household planning, and as an economic predictor of outcomes such as job seeking, entrepreneurial behavior, family planning, migration, and tax evasion.","[Lee, Gregory John] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rees, Gareth] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Lee, GJ (通讯作者)，Wits Business Sch, 2 St Davids Pl, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa.",gregory.lee@wits.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,"This paper is based on work supported by the National Research Foundation.

Our model features trade in fiat money, real assets and a monetary authority which injects money into the economy through short-term and long-term loans to agents. Short-term loans are riskless, but long-term loans are collateralized by a portfolio of real assets and are subject to credit risk. The private monetary wealth of individuals is zero, i.e., there is no outside money. When there is no default in equilibrium, there is indeterminacy. Positive default in every state of the world on some long-term loan endogenously creates positive liquid wealth that supports positive interest rates and resolves the aforementioned indeterminacy. Hence, a non-Ricardian policy across loan markets can determine the equilibrium allocations, while it allows the central bank to earn profits from seigniorage in order to compensate for any losses.","[Lin, Li] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.] Univ Oxford, St Edmund Hall, Oxford, England; [Vardoulakis, Alexandros P.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",International Monetary Fund; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Vardoulakis, AP (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",llin@imf.org; dimitrios.tsomocos@sbs.ox.ac.uk; alexandros.vardoulakis@frb.gov,,"Vardoulakis, Alexandros/0000-0003-0048-1791",,,,,36,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The, objective of this paper was to demonstrate a new forest sector approach for incorporating price uncertainties in order to improve our assessment of investment decision making alternatives. Methodologically, we linked a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (mGARCH (1,1)) with three global land use scenarios that are of strategic importance to the forest bioeconomy. The three scenarios were formulated as i) a business as usual scenario, ii) a high biomass usage scenario and iii) a no-growth scenario. Our results indicate an upward trend in prices over time for all three scenarios and for most woody biomass commodities. Under all scenarios, price volatility in the forest sector would be smaller than that for the fossil fuel energy (i.e. oil and natural gas). Price volatilities from fossil fuel markets are positively influencing woody biomass price volatility and positively influencing pulp volatility. These results are discussed in the context of a case study describing investment alternatives for a district heating facility with options for: woody biomass, natural gas, or heating oil.

In the model, we show the following results. Fewer asset sales, lower financing, debt renegotiation, and running costs, a lower premium to the debt holders, a lower cash flow volatility, and a higher initial coupon increase the shareholders' incentive to choose debt restructuring to avoid full liquidation. In the debt renegotiation process, the shareholders arrange the coupon reduction and use equity financing to retire a part of the debt value to the debt holders. The timing of debt restructuring always coincides with that of liquidation without debt renegotiation. Most notably, the shareholders do not prefer asset sale in debt restructuring even if they face high financing costs. The possibility of debt renegotiation in the future increases the initial leverage ratio in the optimal capital structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a framework involving vertical linkages through resource-based inputs as well as international fiscal linkages between the two types of countries. Our analysis shows that capital market integration causes capital flows from resource-poor to resource-rich countries and improves global production efficiency. However, such gains accrue only to resource-poor countries, and capital mobility might even negatively affect resource-rich countries. Furthermore, we show that resource-rich countries can exploit the gains when taxes on capital are available.","[Ogawa, Hikaru] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Oshiro, Jun] Okinawa Univ, Dept Law & Econ, 555 Kokuba, Okinawa, Japan; [Sato, Yasuhiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan",Nagoya University; Osaka University,"Ogawa, H (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.;Oshiro, J (通讯作者)，Okinawa Univ, Dept Law & Econ, 555 Kokuba, Okinawa, Japan.;Sato, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan.",ogawa@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; j-oshiro@okinawa-u.ac.jp; ysato@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Sato, Yasuhiro/0000-0001-9947-1539","Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI); JSPS KAKENHI [25245042, 25516007, 24-1393, 24730208, 22530228]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730208, 22530228, 25516007, 15K17064, 25245042] Funding Source: KAKEN","Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the editor, John P.

Furthermore, this paper presents an examination of environmental R&D of four types in a Coumot duopoly in a setting where a regulator has no precommitment ability for an emission tax. Results reveal that if the environmental damage is slight, or given severe environmental damage and large inefficiency in environmental R&D costs, then social welfare under environmental research joint venture (ERJV) cartelization is higher than in the other three scenarios: environmental R&D competition, environmental R&D cartelization, and ERJV competition. However, if environmental damage is severe, and if a firm's R&D costs are limited, then, in stark contrast to results of previous studies, environmental R&D competition is socially superior to any of the other three scenarios, although R&D competition is a case without information sharing and R&D coordination.

We discuss sources and causes of observed persistence in caregiving arrangements including inertia/state dependence (confounded by unobserved heterogeneity) and costs of changing caregivers. We comment on causes of dynamics including learning/human capital accumulation; burnout; and game-playing. We suggest how to deal with endogenous geography; dynamics in discrete and continuous choices; and equilibrium issues (multiple equilibria, dynamic equilibria). We also present an overview of commonly used longitudinal data sets and evaluate their relative advantages/disadvantages. We also discuss other data issues related to noisy measures of wealth and family structure.

This paper builds on this theme by recourse to two important concepts in science, namely the assimilative capacity of nature and the entropy of law of thermodynamics. These concepts enable the formulation of an alternative conceptual framework for the explanation of national income (Y) in terms of factor-utilization. In this framework, environmental capital (KN) is an explicit factor besides manufactured capital (KM) and labor (L). A simple methodology that permits the estimation of the volume of KN utilized is used towards demonstrating that economic growth is an entropic process. Empirical illustration of KN utilization as point-estimates is made for Australia and South Korea.","[Thampapillai, Dodo J.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Thampapillai, DJ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",spptj@nus.edu.sg,,"Thampapillai, Jesuthason/0000-0002-9042-4581",,,,,19,1,1,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

(2012), we examine an unconventional Cournot model of the European Union natural gas market with three major suppliers: Russian Gazprom, Norwegian Statoil, and Algerian Sonatrach. To reflect Russia's other strategic consideration besides profit, we incorporate a relative market share into Gazprom's objective function. We prove that when Gazprom pursues the control of market share along with profit, it will be good news for consumers but bad news for its pure profit maximising rivals. We further show that by seeking a proper market share, Gazprom can achieve the same profit of a Stackelberg leader in a simultaneous move model as in the standard sequential move leader follower model. Compared with Jansen et al.'s, our approach makes both the analysis considerably simpler and more transparent, and the model more applicable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Attending a job fair matters: though it does not facilitate direct matches with a job fair employer, attendance leads to a large increase in reported formal sector employment and in the likelihood of looking for any work outside the region in the months following the job fair. Several overseas recruitment agencies participated in the job fair, and attendance affects individuals' overseas labor market perceptions but does not encourage them to take steps to migrate. These results suggest that job fairs can be important tools for encouraging individuals to move to the formal sector and for conveying information about labor market prospects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We examine how policy governing the liner shipping sector affects maritime transport costs and seaborne trade flows. Using a novel dataset of services trade policy information, we find that restrictions, particularly on foreign investment, significantly increase maritime transport costs. The cost-inflating effect ranges from 26% to 68%, and the resultant reduction in trade flows from 48% to 77%, depending on the level of restrictiveness. We estimate the elasticity of seaborne trade flows with respect to distance to be nearly unity, and are able to disentangle the direct effect of distance from the one that is operating indirectly through higher maritime transport costs. Since the bulk of global merchandise goods trade is seaborne, the magnitude of frictions identified in this paper and their spatial distribution have ramifications for connectivity and growth.

Using a fixed effects Tobit model for a 17-state sample of the westernmost states in the contiguous United States, the findings indicate that regulatory shifts played a significant role in determining the type of leasing. In particular, the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 led to an increase in competitive leasing and a decline in non-competitive leasing. Unexpectedly, the party and ideology of relevant federal political actors did not consistently have a significant influence on leasing. More conservative U.S. Senate leadership led to increased competitive leasing, but did not have a significant effect on non-competitive leasing. While for the House of Representatives, Democratic alignment, between the U.S. Congressional leadership and the state delegation to the House, led to decreased leasing. The effects of Federal politics on leasing varied by the branch of Congress and the type of lease issued.","[Maguire, Karen] Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, 327 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Maguire, K (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, 327 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",karen.maguire@okstate.edu,,"Maguire, Karen/0000-0002-4514-3342",PERC Graduate Fellowship Program,PERC Graduate Fellowship Program,"I am grateful for the suggestions that I received from the seminar participants at the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) and the financial support provided through the PERC Graduate Fellowship Program, summer 2010.",,32,1,1,1,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We examine how financial frictions affect companies' choice between processing and ordinary trade implicitly a choice of production technology and position in global supply chains and how this decision affects performance. We exploit matched customs and balance sheet data from China, where exports are classified as ordinary trade, import-and-assembly processing trade (processing firm sources and pays for imported inputs), and pure assembly processing trade (processing firm receives foreign inputs for free). Value added, profits, and profitability rise from pure assembly to processing with imports to ordinary trade. However, more profitable trade regimes require more working capital because they entail higher up-front costs. As a result, credit constraints induce firms to conduct more processing trade and pure assembly in particular and preclude them from pursuing higher value-added, more profitable activities. Financial market imperfections thus impact the organization of production across firms and countries and inform optimal trade and development policy in the presence of global production networks.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; CO2 EMISSIONS; REGIONAL ENERGY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY,"This study discusses the concept of natural and managerial disposability from their economic and methodological implications on social sustainability development. Then, it explores their analytical linkages to a concept on congestion. The concept is classified into Undesirable Congestion (UC) under natural disposability and Desirable Congestion (DC) under managerial disposability. Considering the two disposability concepts, this study compares between Returns to Damage (RTD) under UC and Damages to Return (DTR) under DC Conceptually, UC and DC are conceptually different from RTD and DTR although they are closely related to each other group. An occurrence of the former measures is identified by a single negative multiplier (i.e. dual variable). In contrast, the latter measures are associated with multiple negative multipliers and an intercept of a supporting hyperplane on a production and pollution possibility set. Thus, an occurrence of UC and DC is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition on RTD and DTR, respectively, in terms of the number of negative multipliers on production factors. To document the practicality of the proposed, approach, this study applies it to Chinese economic and environmental assessment for its economic and energy planning for social sustainability development. This study identifies four important findings: First, the Chinese government has historically paid attention to the economic prosperity, but not paying serious attention on the environmental pollution (e.g., air pollution). Second, there was an increasing trend in improving the two components (Le., economic and environmental performance measures) regarding social sustainability. Third, China's economic and energy policy concerns have been focused upon well-developed municipalities (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai) and large provinces. Therefore, it is an important strategy for the government to allocate economic and energy resources to other provinces so that China can reduce the industrial and regional imbalances. As a result, China can enhance the level of social sustainability. Finally, the municipalities need strict regulation on traffic control in these metropolitan areas and a fuel mix shift from coal combustion to natural gas and renewable energies (e.g., solar, water, and nuclear generations). The fuel mix strategy, along with the structure change (e.g., from manufacturing to service and from public to private energy firms), will be a major industrial policy issue for China in near future.

The 2001 reform liberalized divorce in favor of women and secured women's property rights after separation. The paper applies a regression discontinuity analysis on the child sex ratio and finds that the likelihood of having a son after a firstborn daughter decreased by 8.1 percentage points, amounting to a reduction of 11.7% compared with the prior proportion of male children. Further analyses provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that improved divorce options empower women within marriage, and enable them to avoid health-damaging sex selective abortion. The effect of the divorce reform is stronger in provinces where divorce is comparatively viable because of more lenient family planning policies governing fertility in the next marriage. The effect is also stronger among women who face higher health costs of abortion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, these goals are at odds with recent energy and emission trends in the country. Both energy use and GHG emissions in Mexico have grown substantially over the last two decades. We investigate how Mexico might reverse current trends and reach its mitigation targets by exploring results from energy system and economic models involved in the CLIMACAP-LAMP project. To meet Mexico's emission reduction targets, all modeling groups agree that decarbonization of electricity is needed, along with changes in the transport sector, either to more efficient vehicles or a combination of more efficient vehicles and lower carbon fuels. These measures reduce GHG emissions as well as emissions of other air pollutants. The models find different energy supply pathways, with some solutions based on renewable energy and others relying on biomass or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. The economy-wide costs of deep mitigation could range from 2% to 4% of GDP in 2030, and from 7% to 15% of GDP in 2050.

For the purpose of empirically testing this hypothesis, the present paper explores how the degree of conflict between rich and poor people is associated with individual preferences for income redistribution and perceptions regarding income differences. This paper used cross-country individual-level data covering 26 countries. The key findings are as follows: (1) an individual is more likely to prefer income redistribution policy in countries where people perceive conflict between rich and poor to be high; (2) an individual is more likely to consider the income difference to be too large in countries where people perceive conflict between rich and poor to be high; and (3) after dividing the sample into high- and low-income earners, the above two findings are only obtained for high-income earners and not for low-income earners.","[Yamamura, Eiji] Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawaraku Nishijin, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawaraku Nishijin, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,15,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Such informativeness of short selling disappears when the bid test rule was temporarily suspended for pilot stocks.

Households respond by delaying retirement and Social Security benefit collection, by working more hours, and by also saving more. In general equilibrium, these effects lead to a natural expansion of Social Security's tax base and generate significant delayed retirement credits, which the actuarial estimates completely overlook.","[Bagchi, Shantanu] Towson Univ, Towson, MD USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Bagchi, S (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",sbagchi@towson.edu,,,,,,,48,8,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Moreover, tattooed images are permanent unless the individual opts for expensive, time consuming, and painful removal procedures. Given the increasing popularity of tattooing, and the permanent nature of this action, it is of interest to know whether tattooed workers are more or less likely to be employed and, conditional on employment, if they receive wages that are different from the wages of their non-tattooed peers. To investigate these questions, we analyze two large data sets-from the United States and Australia-with measures of tattoo status, employment, earnings, and other pertinent variables. Regardless of country, gender, specific measures, or estimation technique, the results consistently show that having a tattoo is negatively and significantly related to employment and earnings in bivariate analyses, but the estimates become smaller and nonsignificant after controlling for human capital, occupation, behavioral choices, lifestyle factors, and other individual characteristics related to labor market outcomes. Various robustness checks confirm the stability of the core findings. These results suggest that, once differences in personal characteristics are taken into account, tattooed and non-tattooed workers are treated similarly in the labor market. We offer suggestions for improving future surveys to enable a better understanding of the relationships between tattooed workers and their labor market outcomes.","[French, Michael T.] Univ Miami, Dept Sociol, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [French, Michael T.] Univ Miami, Dept Hlth Sect Management & Policy, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [French, Michael T.; Robins, Philip K.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [French, Michael T.] Univ Miami, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Maclean, Johanna Catherine] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Sayed, Bisma] Univ Miami, Sociol Res Ctr, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Shiferaw, Leah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Miami; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"French, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Sociol, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.;French, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Hlth Sect Management & Policy, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.;French, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.;French, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 5202 Univ Dr,Merrick Bldg,Room 121F,POB 248162, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",mfrench@miami.edu; catherine.maclean@temple.edu; probins@miami.edu; bsayed@miami.edu; lshiferaw@berkeley.edu,,"French, Michael/0000-0002-2812-916X",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.

Opponents of liberalization argue that because food crop production is subject to high variability, over-reliance on imports would be risky. To assess the risks to Japan with and without trade liberalization, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations of productivity shocks within a computable general equilibrium model for the four crops of greatest significance in the Japanese diet - rice, wheat, maize, and oilseed. Our results indicate that productivity shocks for rice and maize have a substantial effect on welfare. Liberalizing trade for these crops would both raise expected welfare and reduce welfare fluctuations. This double dividend was forecast even when we limited the simulation to cases of extremely poor crop yields in Japan's major source countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Then, it empirically investigates the impact of U.S. unconventional monetary policies (UMPs), implemented in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis, on U.S. capital flows to developing economies and non-UMP advanced economies. The results suggest that the use of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve has been associated with increased net portfolio flows to developing countries and, to a lesser extent, non-UMP advanced economies. An exit from these UMPs is likely to cause capital flow reversals in U.S. capital-importing countries.

The first is: Can natural gas futures prices predict natural gas spot prices? The second is: Are natural gas spot and futures prices weak form efficient or can they be predicted based on examination of historical data? To answer these questions, we use daily data for Henry Hub natural gas spot and futures prices. Our answer to the first question is that natural gas futures prices do not predict the magnitude of future natural gas spot prices any better than what would be predicted by a random walk model. This result has important implications for many financial analysts and policy institutions that have used commodity futures prices to predict movements in spot prices. The answer to the second question is that when we apply a unit root test that allows for heteroskedasticity and two structural breaks, natural gas spot and futures prices are predictable.

In this model, the dynamics of inequality are driven by the accumulation of human capital. The two redistributive policies are determined by voting, while private education, which supplements public education, is purchased individually. The model, which includes two-dimensional voting, yields the following two types of stable, steady-state equilibria: a high-inequality equilibrium with government expenditures favoring lump-sum transfers or a low-inequality equilibrium with such expenditures favoring public education.","[Ono, Tetsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Ono, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",tono@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Ono, Tetsuo/0000-0002-9838-828X","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [24530346]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530346] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank Andreas Haufler (editor-in-chief) and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions, and Yuki Uchida for his assistance in researching this topic.

We estimate the association of resident grandchildren on transitions in food insecurity using longitudinally linked two-year panels of the Current Population Survey from 2001 to 2010. We find that rates of food insecurity in families with a grandchild present are at least twice as high in a typical year compared with families without a resident grandchild, and the extent of very low food security increased substantially faster among these households over the past decade. The rise in food insecurity during and after the Great Recession is due to both increased entry into food insecurity and decreased exit out of food insecurity. A similar trend accounts for the rise in multigenerational households during the recession-grandchildren were more likely to move in with their grandparents, and once there, were less likely to move out. Our transition models show that whether grandchildren remain, or in periods of transition, multigenerational families are at heightened risk of entering food insecurity and remaining in this state. However, the entry of a grandchild may not always be a negative for the family's food security, nor the exit of the child a positive. Entrance of a child seems to buffer the family from extreme forms of food insecurity while exit exposes the family to risk of deeper food insecurity.","[Ziliak, James P.] Univ Kentucky, Ctr Poverty Res, 550 S Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Ziliak, James P.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, 550 S Limestone St, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 324 Mumford Hall,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Kentucky; University of Kentucky; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gundersen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 324 Mumford Hall,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jziliak@uky.edu; cggunder@illinois.edu,,,Merck Foundation,Merck Foundation(Merck & Company),"Funding for this research was made possible by a generous grant from the Merck Foundation.

We consider a sample of households with a dependent elderly person cared for either at home or in a residential home, extracted from a survey representative of the population of Italy's Emilia-Romagna region. We investigate the determinants of a household's decision to opt for one of the following three alternatives: the institutionalisation of elderly family members, informal home care, or paid home care. We estimate two model specifications, based on a simultaneous and a sequential decision process respectively, the results of which are fairly consistent. Disability related variables, rather than family characteristics, emerge as the main determinants of institutionalisation. On the other hand, household characteristics and socio-economic variables are more influential when it comes to choosing between informal and formal home care provisions.","[Bruni, Matteo Lippi; Ugolini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Ugolini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.",cristina.ugolini@unibo.it,"Lippi Bruni, Matteo/AAI-2496-2019","UGOLINI, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8453-674X; Lippi Bruni, Matteo/0000-0002-1575-0352",,,,,57,4,4,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In employing the assumption that firm CSR increases consumer willingness to pay for the firm's products while consumer willingness to pay decreases for non-CSR firm products, some interesting conclusions are achieved. First, CSR spillover effects increase CSR firm outputs and prices, while CSR spillover has the opposite effect on competitors. Second, CSR spillover decreases total outputs and total social welfare levels. Third, competition effects increase CSR expenditures, and CSR firms' CSR policies are the most robust when non-CSR firms assume a leading position. It is found that total outputs and consumer utilities are highest when CSR firm acts as leader, while the relationships of social welfare among different cases are ambiguous depending on product substitution and spillover effects.","[Chen, You-Hua; Wen, Xiao-Wei; Luo, Ming-Zhong] South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University,"Wen, XW (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wen, XW (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wxwen@126.com,"Luo, mingzhong/HHN-2209-2022; Chen, You-hua/M-4136-2013","Luo, mingzhong/0000-0002-3973-3717; Chen, You-hua/0000-0001-5697-9295","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401057, 71271100, 71333004]; Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD13YLJ02]; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province [2014A070704008, 2012B070300046]; National Social Science Fund of PRC [14AJY020]; China Scholarship Council Foundation [201508440104]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province; National Social Science Fund of PRC; China Scholarship Council Foundation(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71401057, 71271100), the Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD13YLJ02), the Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province (2014A070704008, 2012B070300046), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333004), the National Social Science Fund of PRC (14AJY020) and the China Scholarship Council Foundation (201508440104).",,26,27,28,1,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We design the backward recursion algorithm such that the result is guaranteed to converge to a solution, which is at least as good as the one generated by the multi-stage strategy.

This paper examines a workfare program that was a key part of Germany's active labor market policy for over 30 years. Fixed effects panel estimates suggest that participation in the workfare program offset most, though not all, of the negative effect of unemployment on subjective life satisfaction. Robustness tests find no evidence that this estimate is due to non-parallel time-trends, unobserved shocks in the pre-treatment period, adaptation to unemployment or differences in regional unemployment rates. These results suggest that active labor market policies can help reduce the negative psychological effect of unemployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We exclude individuals who were exposed to high levels of radiation about 4% of the population. Instead, we focus on the remaining majority of Ukrainians who received subclinical radiation doses; we find large and persistent psychological effects of this nuclear disaster. Affected individuals exhibit poorer subjective well-being, higher depression rates and lower subjective survival probabilities; they rely more on governmental transfers as source of subsistence.

On the theoretical side, we prove the existence of both a flip and a Hopf bifurcation locus in the corresponding parameter space. We also show that local indeterminacy can be obtained under any labor supply elasticity or under an arbitrarily low elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption.

The recession provides a sudden change in the employment opportunities of men relative to women in the United States. Using the American Time Use Survey and the linked Current Population Survey, I show that this lopsided shock to employment opportunities was accompanied by an increase in the average amount of time men spent on childcare. In particular, men's average time on physical care for children increased during the recession; this is an element of childcare that men perform less than women. I decompose the total change in average time on childcare into behavioral, compositional, and between group change. A behavioral change among employed men accounted for the majority of the total increase in the average time spent on childcare; among men who are out of the labor force, the increase is entirely due to compositional changes.","[Gorsuch, Marina Mileo] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Rubenstein Hall 235,Box 90315, Durham, NC USA",Duke University,"Gorsuch, MM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Rubenstein Hall 235,Box 90315, Durham, NC USA.",Marina.Gorsuch@duke.edu,,,,,,,36,11,12,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The estimation method takes into account both the simultaneity of time use decisions, by allowing for correlation of residuals across time uses, and unobservable family heterogeneity, through the inclusion of household fixed effects. Importantly, this improved estimation method leads to different results than when applying the methods previously used in the literature. Girls suffer significantly from the absence of their mother with a reduction in time spent in school that is equivalent to dropping out completely. This effect is substantially larger when controlling for household unobservables than when not. Boys increase time spent working on market related activities in response to an absent father, although this time appears to come out of leisure rather than school or doing household chores. Land ownership substantially increase the time boys spend on school activities, whereas renting land reduces the time girls spend on school. Finally, there does not appear to be a substantial trade-off between time spent on school and work, either in the market or at home.","[Portner, Claus C.] Seattle Univ, Albers Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 901 12th Ave,POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Portner, Claus C.] Univ Washington, Ctr Studies Demog & Ecol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Seattle University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Portner, CC (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, Albers Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 901 12th Ave,POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",cportner@seattleu.edu,,"Portner, Claus/0000-0001-8052-9462",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [5R24HD042828],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"I would like to thank Robert E.

The results reflect a deterioration in the level of multidimensional poverty in Spain between 2007 and 2010, as well as an increase in poverty measures calculated using the mentioned thresholds for both the national aggregate and most of its regions, without important changes in the position of the communities in poverty orderings. This worsening is mainly caused by the deterioration of the indicators related to the labor market.","[Prieto Alaiz, Mercedes; Gonzalez Gonzalez, Yolanda] Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Garcia Perez, Carmelo] Univ Alcala, Minist Econ & Competitividad, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Spanish Ministry of Economy & Competitiveness; Universidad de Alcala,"Alaiz, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain.",,"García Pérez, Carmelo/L-5490-2014; Mercedes, Prieto-Alaiz/ABG-5270-2021; Prieto-Alaiz, Mercedes/H-9314-2015","Mercedes, Prieto-Alaiz/0000-0001-5890-3278; Prieto-Alaiz, Mercedes/0000-0001-5890-3278",,,,,61,0,0,0,7,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

In this new model, an increase in long-term unemployment as a share of total unemployment creates short-term trade-offs for optimal monetary policy and a wedge in the dual mandate.

We analyze the joint determination of the non-linear monitoring and tax schedules, and the conditions under which these can be implemented. Monitoring of labor supply reduces the distortions created by income taxation and raises optimal marginal tax rates, possibly above 100%. The optimal intensity of monitoring increases with the marginal tax rate and the labor-supply elasticity. Our simulations demonstrate that monitoring strongly alleviates the trade-off between equity and efficiency. Welfare gains of monitoring are around 2.8% of total output. The optimal intensity of monitoring follows a U-shaped pattern, similar to that of optimal marginal tax rates. Our paper can explain why large welfare states optimally rely on work-dependent tax credits, active labor-market policies, benefit sanctions and work bonuses in welfare programs.

UK banks were subject to both time varying capital requirements and changes in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The differences in the responses of small and large banks identify important distributional consequences within the financial system of these two policy instruments. Finally, our findings do not corroborate theoretical models that raise concerns about complex interactions between monetary policy and macro prudential variation in capital requirements.

The elderly do not sell financial assets or do not liquidate their housing but still can keep the consumption despite the lower consumption expenditure. The related literature could not generate these empirically reported patterns simultaneously. Our paper complements the previous literature by explaining, at least partially, all the puzzling elderly decisions simultaneously. We develop a life-cycle model with housing and non-market time where non-market time denotes the time spent at home for household activities. We use a distinctive and intuitive approach which is modeling non-market time as a substitute for consumption expenditures and as a complement to housing. Our models explain the elderly decisions better than the standard life-cycle model. Our setting could be useful for policy evaluation and future studies related to elderly. Our model could be extended with health shocks to explain wealth holdings completely. Retirees produce more at home by increasing their non-market time. Higher home production allows retirees to maintain their consumption with lower spending and without liquidating most of housing and wealth. Time allocation affects retiree decisions considerably.

A border carbon adjustment (BCA) is often presented as an attractive policy option for countries that wish to go ahead without waiting for a global climate agreement We used the computable general equilibrium model MIRAGE to simulate the impact of the introduction of a BCA on imports of energy-intensive products in EU and EFTA countries and to evaluate the exports their main trade partners would lose. Given that a BCA is a trade measure, it might cause disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO). If the BCA is considered illegal, the losses suffered by some partners may justify trade retaliations. At that point, it would be likely that prohibitive retaliatory tariffs target sensitive products in the EU, which are often related to the European agricultural sector. These trade measures would limit the drop in production in the energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) sectors, but at the expense of the other sectors. Nevertheless, neither the BCA nor retaliation would have sizeable impacts on real income or GDP in the EU or on the retaliators, while leading to a small decrease in global emissions.

We propose that individuals overweight inflation experienced during their lifetimes. This approach modifies existing adaptive learning models to allow for age-dependent updating of expectations in response to inflation surprises. Young individuals update their expectations more strongly than older individuals since recent experiences account for a greater share of their accumulated lifetime history. We find support for these predictions using 57 years of microdata on inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers. Differences in experiences strongly predict differences in expectations, including the substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation, such as the 1970s. It also explains household borrowing and lending behavior, including the choice of mortgages.","[Malmendier, Ulrike] Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Michigan, Natl Bur Econ Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Malmendier, U (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Malmendier, Ulrike/0000-0002-2786-4365",,,,,45,311,359,13,131,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The prospect of future, uncertain productivity shocks on the returns on the firm's effort creates an option value of delaying efforts, a course that exacerbates agency costs. Contracts and organizational forms are drafted to control this cost of delegated flexibility. The possibility for the agent to delay investment in response to uncertainty and irreversibility also elicits preference for unbundling different stages of the project through short-term contracts. Our analysis is relevant to infrastructure sectors that are sensitive to changing weather conditions and sheds a pessimistic light on the relevance of public-private partnerships in this context.","EHESS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; IDEI, ARQADE, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; IAST, Toulouse, France",Paris School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Straub, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne,Bat F, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",stephane.straub@tse-eu.fr,,,PPIAF,PPIAF,"We are extremely grateful to Marianne Fay and Daniel Benitez for initiating this research and providing much detailed comments on a previous version and to PPIAF for providing financial support.

Using a sample of ASEAN commercial banks for the period 2007-2014, this study decomposes their banking performance into managerial and profitability efficiencies. An efficiency analysis reveals that Singaporean banks obtained the highest overall and profitability efficiencies, while Bruneian banks had the lowest rates of banking performance. In the stage of managerial efficiency, the most inefficient banks are those of the Philippines, whereas the greatest level is related to Malaysian banks. A frontier projection analysis suggests that Singaporean banks and Malaysian banks are generally more efficient in managing their expenditures and long-term assets in generating income in the long run. With respect to the con, a regression analysis indicates that loan loss provisions are negatively related to banking performance. Overall, it is advisable that policy makers with oversight function should promote performance evaluation from a multidimensional perspective, and keep an eye on estimates of loan loss provisions at banks over years because increases/decreases in loan loss provisions mean decreases/increases in net income or return on assets.

In a capital-scarce economy, capitalist oligarchs striving for import substitution industrialization (ISI) initially shelter the economy from trade, while promoting industrial policies that promote total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. This gradually shifts the comparative advantage toward manufacturing and renders the economy attractive to foreign investors. Allowing for trade and foreign capital inflows are thus complementary policies that spur growth in the capital oligarchy. By contrast, landed oligarchs in a capital-scarce economy favor openness to trade at an early stage of development, neglect industrial policies, and block foreign capital to maximize extractable rents. The policy mix causes the economy to stagnate. Consistent with the experiences of South Korea and Argentina in the postwar era, the model predicts that the success of ISI policies depends crucially on the conditions governing the incentives for capital accumulation.

It is claimed that such success was achieved by strong support from government expenditures. This study examines the relationship between government expenditures and GDP growth for China within the context of Adolph Wagner's Hypothesis. It covers the most recent time period between 1982 and 2011 and use advanced static and dynamic econometric models to test validity of the Hypothesis for Chinese economy. After determining the stationarity of the series and confirm the existence of the long term relationship between the variables by using the Bounds test approach, we examine the long and short run relationship between government expenditures and GDP using an ARDL model. The ARDL (1, 2) model suggests that 1 percentage point increase in GDP will lead to 1.63 percentage points surge in government expenditures. Finally, we use the Kalman filter to investigate the dynamic relationship between government expenditures and GDP. According to the Kalman filter model, the income elasticity of government expenditures remains between 1.32 and 1.38. Since the elasticity is found larger than 1 in both static and dynamic models, we conclude that Wagner's Hypothesis is valid for China during the 1982-2011 period.","[Atasoy, Burak Sencer] Undersecretariat Treasury, Ankara, Turkey; [Gur, Timur Han] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ministry of Customs & Trade - Turkey; Hacettepe University,"Atasoy, BS (通讯作者)，Undersecretariat Treasury, Ankara, Turkey.;Gür, TH (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Atasoy, Burak Sencer/GRX-0749-2022; Gur, Timur Han/AAD-2627-2019","Atasoy, Burak Sencer/0000-0001-8680-7531;",,,,,68,4,5,0,13,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,1,,,,,45,60,,10.2298/PAN1601045A,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DJ3DL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374084900003,0

The world trends are changing and market is more competitive as ever. These changes are visible in several ways: increased competition from emerging economies, economic structure of countries is changing concerning the importance of manufacturing and services sectors, strategies of positioning in global value chains, geopolitical centers of power, as well as policy initiatives to foster competitiveness and economic growth and development. This paper empirically tested the Granger causality between R&D expenditure and gross domestic product growth in the period 2003-2013. We defined two variables: (1) gross domestic expenditure on research and development as percentage of gross domestic product and (2) gross domestic product (GDP) per capita annual growth rates on the sample of European Union countries. Unidirectional causality from GDP per capita annual growth rate to gross domestic expenditure on research and development with lag two has been confirmed at 5% significance level. Following Granger causality test results in our model we took GDP per capita annual growth rate as an independent variable and R&D expenditures as the dependent one. Afterword we used dynamic panel data and panel generalized method of moments as an estimator. Gross domestic expenditure on research and development on average depends on gross domestic expenditure on research and development previous year with coefficient 0.77 and on annual GDP per capita growth rate with coefficient -0.0073. Even though the sample countries are heterogeneous in terms of GDP per capita level statistically significant effects has been confirmed. The empirical results confirm that most developed European Union countries invest less, measured in relationship to the GDP per capita growth rate, but invest more in absolute terms. It is obvious that the European Union as an integration of rather heterogeneous countries faces many challenges with maintaining and strengthening its position on the world market. Also, the paper gives some overviews of fostering these activities in Croatia.","[Bilas, Vlatka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Bosnjak, Mile] SKDD CCP Smart Clear Inc, Zagreb, Croatia; [Cizmic, Tomislav] Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zagreb; University of Mostar,"Bilas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",bilas.vlatka@gmail.com; mile.bisnjak76@gmail.com; tomislav.cizmic@euroherc.hr,"Bošnjak, Mile/K-7237-2019; Bošnjak, Mile/T-3085-2018; Bilas, Vlatka/I-9372-2018","Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X; Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X; Bilas, Vlatka/0000-0002-9021-6651",,,,,22,6,6,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,223,230,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100025,0

In order to capture volatility clustering and the asymmetric property of various realized volatilities, the HAR and ARFIMA models are extended with asymmetric GARCH threshold specification. In addition, the asymmetric innovations of various realized volatilities are characterized by a skewed student-t distribution.

Subjective expectations, in particular about mortality risk but not the risk of living with HIV, play an important role in determining the decision to have multiple sexual partners. Using our estimated parameters, we simulate the impact of various policies that would influence expectations. An information campaign on mortality risk would decrease risky sexual behaviour on average, whereas an information campaign on HIV transmission risks, which tend to be overestimated by respondents, would actually increase risky behaviour. Also, the expansion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) treatments to all individuals infected with HIV would increase risky sexual behaviour for a quarter of the HIV-negative individuals or those who have not been tested because they are aware that ART increases life expectancy, and thus reduces the cost of becoming HIV positive.","[Delavande, Adeline] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Delavande, Adeline] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Kohler, Hans-Peter] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Essex; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Pennsylvania,,,"Kohler, Hans-Peter/HNP-6421-2023","Kohler, Hans-Peter/0000-0003-0639-4349; Delavande, Adeline/0000-0001-8691-6359","National Institute of Child Health and Development [R03HD058976, R21 HD050652, R01 HD044228, R01 HD053781]; Nova Forum; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social Change; Population Aging Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania [NIA P30 AG12836]; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania [NICHD R24 HD-044964]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute of Child Health and Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Nova Forum; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social Change; Population Aging Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Charles Bellemare, Iliyan Georgev, Alberto Holly, Erik Meijer, Chuck Manski, Steve Pudney, Joao Santos Silva, Olivier Sterck, and Luis Vasconcelos for comments.

In most European countries, mainstream financial institutions are scantly able to provide affordable credit facilities to small firms. Thus, these firms are forced to finance their growth almost exclusively through retained earnings. We estimate a dynamic version of Gibrat-law, incorporating cash flow as a measure of financial constraints, for two different size classes within small and medium size enterprises and for several industries in manufacturing and service sectors. The findings show that, in general, small manufacturing firms have higher growth-cash flow sensitivities with respect to medium firms. Conversely, our results highlight, for the services, a significant heterogeneity in the impact of liquidity constraints on firm growth. In particular, the sensitivity of growth rates to the cash flow appears relatively high for small firms belonging to Knowledge Intensive Business Services. Validation of Gibrat-law in the services suggests that an important group of industries, with a superior capacity of encouraging firm's competitiveness, need more financial resources to promote their growth and that of the manufacturing sectors with whom they are connected.","[Donati, Cristiana] Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Capua, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Donati, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Capua, Italy.",cristiana.donati@unina2.it,,,,,,,44,16,16,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, we systematically examine how different modeling assumptions affect the results. We find little support for some widely used assumptions in the literature (e.g., population weights), but find that allowing for the effect of the law to be heterogeneous across both counties and over time is important for explaining the observed patterns of crime. In terms of model uncertainty, we find that there is substantial variation in the estimated effects for each model across all dimensions of the model space. This suggests that one should be cautious in using the results from any particular model to inform policy decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a macroeconomic environment with a relatively high degree of uncertainty, decisions to accumulate capital rely heavily on retained earnings and are negatively affected by the persistent high level of interest rates. Our econometric exercise reveals that the interest rate is the most important variable to explain the investment rate, and that financialization negatively impacts physical capital accumulation.","[Feijo, Carmem; Lamonica, Marcos Tostes; Albuquerque Bastos, Julio Cesar] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Feijó, C (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"FEIJO, CARMEM/G-6950-2019","FEIJO, CARMEM/0000-0002-6376-4599",,,,,45,7,10,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This concept which is in general scrutinized personally, regionally and globally and which is neglected by the sectors and the enterprises is one of the major factors affecting the sectoral and economic structure. Thus, determining the inequality level which results from the intensifying digital divide along with developing technology gains importance. In general the computer and internet usage rates are used as indexes for determination of the digital divide levels and the analyses are carried out with statistical methods according to the demographic variables. Gini method, one of the standard tools of inequality measurement, is rarely encountered in the digital divide studies. The purpose of this study is to determine the intersectoral digital divide by Gini method. The usage differences of the Turkish and Lithuanian sectoral information systems were analyzed in order to determine the digital divide by Gini method. The data was obtained from the reports published by Tuik and Eurostat between 2010 and 2013 based on the studies of the usage of the information systems by the enterprises. Gini values, which show the sectoral digital divide, were calculated using the data regarding the computer, internet, social media usages, having web page and selling over web which belong to the sectors classified according to the Nace Rev. 2 system. The analysis revealed that both Turkey and Lithuania have low levels of sectoral digital divide. The highest level of digital divide was observed in the case of the selling over web and an increasing trend of the sectoral differences has been identified. Although Lithuania had high rates of information systems usage, it has been determined that the intersectoral differences are more than those in Turkey, in terms of usage of the information systems.","[Fidan, Huseyin] Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, Istiklal Campus, Burdur, Turkey",Mehmet Akif Ersoy University,"Fidan, H (通讯作者)，Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, Istiklal Campus, Burdur, Turkey.",hfidan@mehmetakif.edu.tr,"Fidan, Hüseyin/AAC-1630-2019",,,,,,89,7,7,2,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this paper, I relax this assumption, developing a framework in which to analyze the role of interactions among countries' patterns of comparative advantage in determining the aggregate effects of trade barriers. My model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account. After fitting my model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of trade barriers. A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed in favor of low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firms permanently differ in productivity levels, their production function features constant returns to scale, and search costs are convex in search intensity. Wages are determined in a competitive manner, as firms advertise wage contracts (expected discounted incomes) so as to balance wage costs and search costs (queue length). Firms are assumed to sort out their coordination problems with their employees in such a way that the on-the-job search behavior of workers maximizes the match surplus. Our model has several novel features. First, it is close in spirit to the competitive model, with a tractable and unique equilibrium, and is therefore useful for empirical testing. Second, on-the-job search is an efficient response to firm heterogeneities and convex search costs. Third, the equilibrium leans towards a job ladder, where unemployed workers apply to low-productivity firms offering low wages, and then gradually move on to more productive, higher-paying firms. With a continuum of firm types, the job ladder is strict, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the productivity of the current employer and that of the firms she searches for. The paper also contributes methodologically, as the existence proof requires a version of Schauder's fixed point theorem that is not commonly used by economists. Finally, our model offers different implications for the dynamics of job-to-job transitions than existing models of random search. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines the trends in students' mobility within the EU and its potential effect on employment of university graduates in the EU countries. We assume that more international experience of students during their studies could improve their practical skills which could further lead to better employability of graduates on average. We are focused especially on countries' openness to the international mobility of students expressed as the sum of students arriving in the country and those studying in another EU country. The paper is mostly empirically oriented using panel data for 28 EU member states in the period 2000-2012. We firstly applied fixed effects regression in order to capture potential short-run effects. In the second stage we used panel cointegration techniques in order to test potential causality between selected variables in the long-run. We found relatively strong evidence that the openness of the country with respect to students' exchange (both inward and outward) could have a positive effect on employment of graduates. This seems to be especially true in the long run. Thus, the international mobility of students seems to be beneficial in respect of increasing overall employment rate of university graduates in the long-run.","[Hunady, Jan; Orviska, Marta; Pisar, Peter] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Hunady, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",jan.hunady@umb.sk; marta.orviska@umb.sk; peter.pisar@umb.sk,"Pisar, Peter/ABE-4019-2020; Orviska, Marta/U-5000-2019; Hunady, Jan/B-9678-2019","Hunady, Jan/0000-0002-7075-2289",Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV) [APVV-14-0512],Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV)(Slovak Research and Development Agency),"This research was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (APVV), APVV-14-0512 Universities and regional development.",,21,1,1,0,8,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,702,710,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800087,0

Special attention is mostly paid on financial support for LAG activities in the period 2009-2015 within these activities was also significantly supported rural tourism. In this paper, we identify the position of Nitra selfgoverning region in terms of the importance of tourism, comparing the position of Nitra self-governing region with other regions in Slovakia on the basis of selected capacity and performance indicators of tourism. We analyze the volume, the focus of support (subsidies) within rural tourism sector, the main beneficiaries of these resources and spatial distribution of subsidies within the region. Results of the analysis point to favorable conditions for the development of rural tourism in Nitra self-governing region, but at the same time the underutilized potential of the region. In order to support the development of rural tourism, Nitra self-governing region implemented in the period 2007-2015 two own financial instruments whose purpose was to promote the creation of tourism products, building and reconstruction of tourism infrastructure, protection and management of natural and cultural resources and so-called soft projects focusing on education, marketing, management of free time and cooperation among the stakeholders in tourism.","[Jarabkova, Jana; Majstrikova, L'ubica] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Dept Reg & Rural Dev, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Jarábková, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Dept Reg & Rural Dev, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",jana.jarabkova@uniag.sk; l.majstrikova@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,7,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,1016,1024,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-131,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500132,0

First plum orchards were planted in the 3th and 4th century near the river Sava and Drava by Roman emperors. Plum brandy has been produced for 300 years and made with traditional varieties of plums. The production of plum brandy Slavonska sljivovica has significantly contributed to the preservation of traditional plum cultivars in Slavonia, whereas the fruits of these genotypes are used for distillation. It is believed that these traditional cultivars provide characteristic aroma and authenticity of traditional plum brandy. In Slavonia between the years of 1885 and 1890, average plum yield was 672,631 metric cents (1 m.c. = 100 kg). In 1885 production of plum brandy was 27,163 hl, and in 1890 4 453 hl. This long-term production and the traditional way of plum cultivation have resulted with high genetic and morphological diversity of plums that have been grown in Slavonia. In the experimental orchard of the Institute of Pomology (Croatian Centre for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs), located in Donja Zelina, Croatia, 18 of analysed varieties have been planted.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of ROOs on the equilibrium FTA regime and the welfare effects. Design/methodology/approach - The authors determine the impact of ROOs on the equilibrium FTA regime based on an oligopolistic model where there are asymmetry in production technologies of intermediate goods and the capacity of outsourcing intermediate goods. Findings - The authors demonstrate that ROOs are used as a protective trade policy against the FTA member country with an outsourcing option for technologically dominant intermediate goods. Practical implications - The non-cooperative features of ROOs found in this paper necessitates the introduction of an international coordination mechanism to avoid the prisoners' dilemma-type implementation of ROOs. Originality/value - This paper provides a theoretical frame to analyze the protective effects of ROOs under PTAs.,"[Kim, Young-Han; Ha, Eui-Hyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, YH (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kimyh@skku.edu,,"Kim, Young-Han/0000-0002-4071-5751",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"Many insightful comments and suggestions by two anonymous reviewers and the participants of ETSG Conference at Munich in 2014 have greatly improved this paper, and are deeply appreciated.

These phenomena are studied through the perspectives of critical geopolitics' two sub disciplines: popular geopolitics and anti-geopolitics. Urban movements represent a type of social movements devoted mostly to the resistance of urban population towards changing of the cities under the influence of neoliberalism i.e. capital and private interests. Urban movements that were studied were mostly the ones resisting the privatization of public space as an expression of neoliberalisation of the cities, which has been going on for the last three decades in the West, and for about two decades in the former socialist countries and various emerging economies, such as P.R. China. Studying of urban movements has a tradition of a little more than quarter of a century, since critical geopolitics as a geopolitical perspective exists. It is mostly tied with the geopolitics of resistance i.e. anti-geopolitics that is an expression of challenges to the cultural, political, moral and economic dominance of the elites in various societies. Social movements represent the ties that bind the individuals involved in resistance, hence they articulate individual actions into comprehensive, socially visible and tangible actions that attract and keep the attention of the society as well as the authorities. In the era of social media, social movements have much more diverse ways of transmitting messages and coordinating actions. The main conclusion is that we live in the era of social movements (and therefore urban movements as well), in which social media have become a very important means of the social movements' actions.","[Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,49,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,63,73,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500006,0

There is quite strong support for impression management in banks' graph use in the context of selectivity. Weaker support was found for the existence of favourable measurement distortions. Still, compared to previous research, weaker links exist between KFV graph use and banks' profit performance.

This study examines professional scepticism among fraud auditors in the forensic accounting profession in China (CN) and the United States (US). Data are collected from 373 and 401 CN and US auditors, respectively, in two economies with cultural differences. The multinomial logistic regression results indicate that both CN and US fraud auditors have higher levels of professional scepticism than general auditors do. There are no significant differences in traits between CN and US fraud auditors. High-ranking fraud auditors have higher levels of professional scepticism than junior-ranking fraud auditors for both CN and US auditors. The results of our sensitivity analysis validate the main results and indicate the findings' robustness. Results support the normative pillar of the institutional theory (Scott 1995) that asserts actors (fraud auditors) of institutions would share common norms and beliefs in a social system because they are rooted in professional affiliations (accounting bodies) (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Our findings contribute to the literature in the arena of the interests of the public and the economy.","[Law, Philip; Yuen, Desmond] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Dept Accounting, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Law, P (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Dept Accounting, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",PLaw@umac.mo,,,,,,,53,2,5,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These include mechanical, electromechanical and computer devices. Due to the passage of time, which causes systems aging and wearing, these devices are in different technical condition. The quality and safety of railway traffic depends on how well they operate. A crucial element of the international railway lines in terms of smooth and safe traffic management are crossovers, which allow to change the tracks. The replacement of crossovers involves installing new switch machines, while the modernisation of the whole station involves construction of new rail traffic control systems. These upgraded systems are built mainly using computer technology. Therefore, all over the Europe, to ensure an adequate level of safety and reliability they require uninterruptible power supply, so these power supply devices must be sufficiently reliable, stable and safe. In the article, the authors will present both older as well as modern solutions of the power supply railway traffic control systems, that are used by international railway companies. These solutions will be analysed taking into account the quality of the power supply and the costs of obtaining the appropriate level of reliability. Their advantages and disadvantages will be summarised and prospects for development of safe power supply railway traffic control systems will be discussed.","[Lukasik, Leszek; Ciszewski, Tomasz; Wojciechowski, Jerzy] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Wojciechowski, J (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",l.lukasik@uthrad.pl; t.ciszewski@uthrad.pl; j.wojciechowski@uthrad.pl,"Wojciechowski, Jerzy/L-7324-2019; Ciszewski, Tomasz/AAB-4766-2021","Ciszewski, Tomasz/0000-0002-5493-2116",National Centre for Research and Development [PBS3/A6/29/2015],"National Centre for Research and Development(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)",This material is based upon work supported by National Centre for Research and Development under Grant No. PBS3/A6/29/2015 entitled The system for maintenance data acquisition and analysis of reliability and safety of traffic control systems.,,17,9,9,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1212,1219,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800150,0

The level of membership to the separated classes was estimated for each region in particular years of the adopted research period 2000-2010, which facilitated analyzing the directions of their location changes in the European area divided into classes. The obtained results allowed for the positive verification of the proposed hypotheses about the usefulness of fuzzy classification in the identification of areas and directions for smart specialization changes in regions establishing the European regional area.

The multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods and multivariate methods (cluster analysis) can be considered as a suitable and useful tool. The aim of the paper is to evaluate and compare the development of regional disparities in the Visegrad Group in the years 2004 and 2014 by the selected MCDM and multivariate methods. The selected weighting method (CRITIC method) is used to derive the weights of the regional indicators. Based on TOPSIS method and cluster analysis, ranking of NUTS 2 regions and homogeneous clusters of regions are determined.

There are many theoretical ways to treat public debt as inter-generation burden.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effects of shifts in public debt structure on economic growth of 18 EU countries, these countries are also the OECD members. Results should be used to optimization of debt management. The empirical analysis employs a dynamic panel regression in period from 2000 to 2015 making use of the GMM estimator. According to results there is an evidence that changes of public debt structure affect the economic growth. It seems to be important to linkage the structure with debt cost if one look at the maturity structure of public debt. Debt shift from long-term instruments to short-terms should promote the growth. From the point of view of debt residency of creditors, the public debt shift from domestic creditors to external creditors is harmful to growth. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Hausman origin sin hypothesis affects economic growth of surveyed sample, as one can expect because of Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.","[Murin, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Murín, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",murin.martin@mail.muni.cz,"Murin, Martin/S-8419-2019","Murin, Martin/0000-0003-0070-4270",,,,,21,1,1,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,481,489,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200051,0

With globalisation intensifying countries are becoming increasingly for international exchange of goods, services, economic growth and sustainability. SMEs are very vulnerable to fluctuations and unexpected changes of global business environment despite of their special features such as dynamics, flexibility and narrow specialization. The outbreak of the global financial and economic crisis was an external shock that seriously threaten existence of SMEs in European Union. SMEs were affected by the rapid decline in demand for goods and services and by tightening in credit conditions. Confronted with worsening access to credit, SMEs were forced to use alternative source of finance such as the mobilisation of reserves or self-financing. Access to financing continues to be one of the most significant challenges for the creation, survival and growth of SMEs in a globalising environment. According to European Commission and European Central Bank surveys access to finance for SMEs is not such significant problem as it was during the crisis period. SMEs are currently facing significant problems as finding customers, availability of skilled staff or experienced managers. The aim of this paper is to briefly summarize the views of selected authors and results of surveys about the access to finance for European SMEs and present the results of an own empirical survey about financing of SMEs in Slovakia.","[Musa, Hussam; Strokova, Zuzana; Musova, Zdenka] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Stroková, Z (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",hussam.musa@umb.sk; zuzana.strokova@umb.sk; zdenka.musova@umb.sk,"Musa, Hussam/C-9944-2019",,,,,,16,13,13,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1458,1465,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800180,0

Comparing methods has been demonstrated that the potential use of corporate accounting is possible for the metallurgical industry analysis. In the case of the metalworking industry it would be appropriate to add data for smaller companies. Analysis showed that more balanced results presented metalworking industry during the crisis period. The metallurgical industry showed declines of performances after 2011.

We found the primary mover of CO2 emissions to be energy intensity effect (52%) followed by activity effect 25%) and economy structure effect (16%). The combined contribution of energy mix effect, emission factors effect and population effect reached only approximately 7%, which implies that as much as 93 % CO2 emissions were determined to large extent by exogenous impetuses.

Buying behaviour seems to be connected with level of education and net income, but both factors are not relevant for cluster analysis.","[Olsavsky, Frantisek] Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Olsavsky, F (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",frantisek.olsaysky@fm.uniba.sk,,,[VEGA 1/1051/11],,This article has been elaborated as one of the outcomes of research project VEGA 1/1051/11 Analysis of the strategic process of brand building and brand management in the context of homogenization and individualization of consumer needs.,,17,3,3,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-636-0,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2016,6.0,,,,,,756,762,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000539487200091,0

The results suggest that the exchange rate of the three selected countries behavior is different in the event of an oil price shock, not only before and after the oil peak of July of 2008, but also between each other. Therefore, no general rule can be made for net oil importing sub-Saharan countries, such as Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania.

This paper examines the intensity, quality and other parameters of the interaction from the perspective of Croatian businessmen. The subject scores on a national level are then compared with the evaluation scores obtained by the examined business entities from eastern Croatia (including five Croatian counties: Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Pozega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Srijem). In this paper the results of an empirical research are presented. The research is conducted on a sample composed of 120 Croatian companies from all Croatian counties. The highly structured questionnaire is the applied survey instrument and the research was conducted online. Results of the conducted research indicate that there are some differences regarding the intensity of science-business collaboration in eastern Croatia compared to the national average. As the average score of all the collaboration indicators are rather low in general, both at national and regional level, it is necessary to use the potential of the science-business collaboration more significantly to advance the regional economic development of the Republic of Croatia.","[Raguz, Mirjana Jelec] Polytech Pozega, Social Dept, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia; [Mehicic, Nihada Mujic] Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Raguz, MJ (通讯作者)，Polytech Pozega, Social Dept, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",mjelecraguz@vup.hr; nmujic@pravos.hr,"Raguz, Mirjana/JUU-9537-2023; Raguž, Mirjana Jeleč/R-9417-2019",,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,624,634,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600063,0

Accordingly, the following research hypothesis was formulated: there is a relationship between the type of own revenue identified with respect to fiscal autonomy and the size of investment expenditures. Revenues characterized by low or no fiscal autonomy are more likely to be earmarked for current expenditures. The study encompasses the 2003-2011 period. Two groups of local government entities were analyzed: cities with county rights and communes (with the exception of city communes that are cities with county rights, constituting the first group). The calculations carried out demonstrated that in both analyzed groups the revenues characterized by extensive fiscal autonomy (EFA), such as revenues from the property tax, had the greatest impact on investment expenditure: in communes, an increase in revenue in this group by PLN 1,000,000 resulted in an increase in investment expenditure by PLN 2,180,000, while in cities with county rights it increased by PLN 1,320,000. The general conclusion is that local government entities should be granted the type of own revenues that they are allowed to structure to the greatest extent, since this is the type of revenues that most fully translates into investment activity, thus ensuring the strongest stimulus for development.","[Sekula, Alicja; Basinska, Beata] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Sekula, A (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",,"Sekuła, Alicja/ABC-4539-2020; Basinska, Beata A./L-2835-2013","Sekuła, Alicja/0000-0003-4396-3811; Basinska, Beata A./0000-0002-6532-7093",,,,,33,3,3,0,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Under this circumstance, the purpose of this study is to analyse the socio-economic value of developing assistive technologies with the potential to improve the quality of social life, especially for disabled and elderly individuals. Based on a survey of 400 respondents, the spike model, a special form of the contingent valuation method (CVM) is applied to assess the value of assistive technologies. In Korea, a household's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the development of assistive technologies is US$4.26 per year, on average, in the form of a government-levied tax; although many people express zero WTP for the development of these technologies, people with higher household savings, higher levels of education and higher levels of charity donations have a higher WTP for the development of assistive technology. We conclude that although assistive technologies have considerable economic value many people express zero WTP for the development of these technologies. Therefore, political and social educational efforts are necessary to reach social consensus on the government investment in such technologies.","[Shin, Jungwoo] Korea Environm Inst, Environm Policy Res Grp, Sejong Si, South Korea; [Kim, Yeunjoong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea; [Nam, Heekoo; Cho, Youngsang] Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Yeunjoong] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Ind & Strategy Dept 1, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University; Samsung,"Cho, Y (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",y.cho@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Shin, Jungwoo/0000-0002-7772-8636",,,,,57,7,7,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The thesis focuses on two research questions, specifically (1) if there is a link between targets set on the national level and the local targets and (2) whether the locally set targets correspond to the actual local situation, monitored on the issues connected with environmental protection. Methodologically, the thesis has made use of an analysis of a randomly selected set of strategic development documents of towns and municipalities in the Czech Republic and a comparison of their results with the national level documents, and secondly it was an observation with a relatively objective indicator of the environmental situation in the municipalities, which is the ecological stability coefficient (ESC). The findings indicate the fact that almost one third of strategic plans on the local level pay no attention whatsoever to one of the major strategic priorities of the country environmental protection. Therefore, in response to the research question if there is a link between targets set on the national level and the local targets, one can give only an ambiguous answer, because clearly there is some link, but its strength is considerably smaller than expected and furthermore quite evidently there is no correlation between the real quality of the environment in a municipality and the quantity of targets focusing on these issues in the municipal strategy.","[Silhankova, Vladimira; Pondelicek, Michael] Coll Reg Dev, Dept Reg Dev, Zalanskeho 68-54, Prague 16300, Czech Republic",AMBIS University,"Silhánková, V (通讯作者)，Coll Reg Dev, Dept Reg Dev, Zalanskeho 68-54, Prague 16300, Czech Republic.",vladimira.silhankova@vsrr.cz; mpondelicek@gmail.com,"Silhankova, Vladimira/J-5000-2015",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,641,647,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-82,0.0,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500083,0

It seems important to seek factors that underlie business intentions and that go beyond Ajzen's theory when adapting the model to business-related behaviour. This study aims to determine the predictive value of Snyder's hope of success for start-up intentions. The study was conducted at the University of Finance and Management in Warsaw (Poland) with 347 students of various majors using the Start-up Intentions Questionnaire (SuIQ), the Hope Scale (HS), and the Multidimensional Personal and Business Data Sheet. Potential entrepreneurs displayed stronger start-up intentions than people who did not plan to start a business. Positive correlations were found between start-up intentions and the scores in the HS subscales. The scores in Pathways were the only variables in the regression model that were significant predictors of start-up intentions. The other independent variables - the score for Agency, the total HS score, age, and sex - did not achieve the required significance level. Deepening one's convictions, especially about one's skills and persistence in solving problems, may be considered one of the factors underlying start-up intentions.","[Staniewski, Marcin] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland; [Awruk, Katarzyna] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland",,"Staniewski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",staniewski@vizja.pl,"Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/AAE-1854-2021","Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/0000-0003-1913-6007; Awruk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3068-6309",,,,,66,12,12,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using survey data from Uganda with both hypothetical and incentivized choices over different goods, we elicit time preferences from about 2400 subjects. We reject the null of equal discount rates across goods: the average person in our sample is more impatient about sugar, meat and starchy plantains than about money and a list of other goods. We review the assumptions to recover discount rates from experimental choices for the case of good-specific discounting. Consistently with the theoretical framework, we find convergence in discount rates across goods for two groups expected to engage in or think about arbitraging the rewards: traders and individuals with large quantities of the good at home. As an application, we evaluate empirically the conditions under which good-specific discounting could predict a low-asset poverty trap. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

China's monetary expansion has significant effects on Japan's economy that are quite different from those of the U.S. and Euro area. In line with the implications of the Mundell-Fleming model when there are capital controls in place, Chinese monetary expansion is found to primarily affect Japan through trade. The income absorption effect of China's monetary expansion is substantial for Japan. China's monetary expansion results in significant increases in Japan's industrial production, exports and inflation, and decreases in the trade-weighted yen. After 24 months, monetary shocks in China forecast 20% of the variation in Japan's real trade balance. In contrast, U.S. monetary expansion results in contraction in Japan's industrial production, exports and trade balance (expenditure-switching). Monetary expansion in the Euro area does not significantly affect Japan. Structural vector error correction models and a factor-augmented model are estimated to establish robustness of results.

We modify the standard beta-convergence model to incorporate undesirable outputs such as CO2 emissions. The bootstrap method is subsequently applied to estimate the values of ETFP, and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator is employed to test for convergence. The results indicate that there is imperfect interregional economic convergence in China, which is supported by gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 emissions. However, the convergence process is inefficient due to the 'catching up' convergence trend of per capita CO2 emissions in China. This paper also finds that the variation in the capital stock and labour does not support the hypothesis that all of the provinces can converge to a steady state. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to examine the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth from the perspective of public debt for Indonesia and Malaysia between periods of 2000 - 2013 via the threshold regression analysis. Our empirical results indicate that there are significant relationship between energy consumption and economic growth from the public debt threshold perspective for both countries. The analysis of Indonesia shows that higher level of public debt will lead to greater impact on energy consumption and economic nexus. In contrast, the impact of the energy consumption on economic growth for the case of Malaysia indicates a diminishing trend in the energy and economic growth nexus when the public debt is above the threshold level. Important policy implication from this study suggests that Indonesia and Malaysia should be more careful in formulating the energy consumption related policy by considering different perspectives such as public debt level of the nation. Moreover, both countries should consider reducing their dependence on the non-renewable energy resources and shifting to renewable energy resources such as solar, hydro, landfill gas for their economic development in the future.","[Yong, Sze Wei] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Lean, Hooi Hooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Kueh, Jerome] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Sains Malaysia; University of Malaysia Sarawak,"Yong, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Sarawak, Malaysia.",yongszewei@sarawak.uitm.edu.my,"Kueh, Jerome/T-1092-2018; Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010","Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-11473-6-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,9,16,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000449461100002,0

This paper examines the consumption smoothing benefit of the UI program over the last 40 years, finding strong evidence of heterogeneity in this effect over time. In particular, the effects of UI are smaller in the 1990s compared with the 1970s. The 1990s were unique because of the long period of low unemployment rates as well as relatively low UI program generosity, thus we test whether the consumption smoothing effects vary by the state unemployment rate and average program generosity. We find suggestive evidence that the effects are larger when the state unemployment rate and average generosity are high. Together, these two dimensions can explain around 30-46% of the differential effect that we find in the 1990s. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that when banks diversify from interest-only income, they achieve higher market-to-book valuations and improved solvency, but only up to a point, beyond which these performance indicators are negatively associated with higher levels of diversification. It appears that a continued diversification of assets bases away from traditional loan assets does not of itself imply an improved market performance.

Increased relations with Russia, eastern partners or Asia provide opportunities for Baltic cities and ports to become a crossroads between western Europe and the economically and culturally thriving hinterland.","[Escach, Nicolas] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Geog, Versailles, France; [Escach, Nicolas] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, EVS UMR 5600, Lyon, France; [Serry, Arnaud] Univ Havre, Geog, UMR IDEES 6266, Le Havre, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Le Havre Normandie,"Escach, N (通讯作者)，Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Geog, Versailles, France.",nicolas.escach@uvsq.fr; serryarnaud@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This question was at the center of the historical debate between Keynes and White in 1944 and is being debated increasingly these days for the Eurozone. Should consolidation by deficit countries be complemented by higher spending in surplus countries in order to avoid a downward bias in the level of consumption? We investigate the associated disequilibrium behavior experimentally, letting our experimental subjects act as heads of state who repeatedly seek to coordinate their policies. If only deficits are punished, as proposed by White, we observe that consumption is persistently reduced and adjustment is slower than in a treatment in which a surplus is also punished, as suggested by Keynes. We find support for the fact that underconsumption occurs for behavioral but not for rational reasons.","[Giamattei, Marcus; Lambsdorff, Johann Graf] Univ Passau, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Passau,"Giamattei, M (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Innstr 27, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",marcus.giamattei@uni-passau.de; jlambsd@uni-passau.de,"Giamattei, Marcus/GZK-6602-2022","Graf Lambsdorff, Johann/0000-0002-5713-6991; Giamattei, Marcus/0000-0002-5908-286X",,,,,55,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The results confirm the existence of price dispersion, although the importance of it differs according to the type of product analyzed.

CB is a financial mechanism that allows market participants, including electricity suppliers, consumers and virtual traders, to arbitrage price differences between the day-ahead (DA) market and the real-time (RT) market without physically consuming or producing energy. In this paper, market efficiency is defined in terms of trading profitability, where a zero-profit competitive equilibrium implies market efficiency (Jensen in, J Financial Econ 6(2):95-101, 1978). We analyze market data in the CAISO electric power markets, and empirically test for market efficiency by assessing the performance of trading strategies from the perspective of virtual traders. By viewing DA-RT spreads as payoffs from a basket of correlated assets, we can formulate a chance constrained portfolio selection problem, where the chance constraint takes two different forms as a value-at-risk constraint and a conditional value-at-risk constraint, to find the optimal trading strategy. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is further proposed to capture the presence of the time-varying forward premium. This is meant to be a contribution to the modeling of regime shifts in the electricity forward premium with unobservable states. Our backtesting results cast doubt on the efficiency of the CAISO electric power markets, as the trading strategy generates consistent profits after the introduction of CB, even in the presence of transaction costs. Nevertheless, by comparing with the performance before the introduction of CB, we find that the profitability decreases significantly, which enables us to identify the efficiency gain brought about by CB. Convincing evidence for the improvement of market efficiency in the presence of CB is further provided by the test for the Bessembinder and Lemmon (J Finance 57(3):1347-1382, 2002) model.","[Li, Ruoyang; Oren, Shmuel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Svoboda, Alva J.] Pacific Gas & Elect Co, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E),"Oren, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ruoyang@berkeley.edu; ajsh@pge.com; oren@ieor.berkeley.edu,,,Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh; Directorate For Engineering [0969016] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),,,37,36,44,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This ambiguity can be investigated by observing the role of the underground economy in shaping the productivity of firms. Indeed, unemployment may be absorbed by underground firms, which adopt backward technology, at the cost of reduced economic growth. Alternatively, unemployment diminishes because productivity grows by employing workers who prefer to become skilled, and thus not to work in underground firms. This paper develops these arguments by using a matching model with underground firms and heterogeneous entrepreneurial ability, and by assuming skills-driven growth. Economic growth thus becomes endogenous, and both the underground sector and unemployment become persistent. The main result is that, under conditions of strict monitoring of the regularity of firms, the underground economy is squeezed, unemployment is reduced, and growth is high, whereas in the case of lax monitoring, the underground economy expands, unemployment is absorbed, and growth is low.","[Lisi, Gaetano; Pugno, Maurizio] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Cassino,"Lisi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, FR, Italy.",m.pugno@unicas.it,"Pugno, Maurizio/AAG-5669-2019",,,,,,62,5,5,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

This paper examines the impact of child-care costs on the employment rates of mothers with children younger than 12 years. Using data from the 1995 and 2002 Austrian Microcensus, combined with administrative wage data from Austrian tax records, we estimate the impact of net wages and child-care costs on mothers' employment probabilities. In line with theoretical considerations and most of the empirical literature, we find a negative elasticity of mothers' employment rates to child-care costs as well as positive elasticity with regard to net wages. The point estimates for the impact of net wages and child-care costs are of similar absolute size. Additionally, the empirical results indicate that higher family income reduces the employment probability of mothers.","[Mahringer, Helmut; Zulehner, Christine] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Zulehner, Christine] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Mahringer, H (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",helmut.mahringer@wifo.ac.at; christine.zulehner@jku.at,,"Zulehner, Christine/0000-0002-5591-3830",Jubilaumsfonds of Osterreichische Nationalbank [12975]; Statistik Austria,Jubilaumsfonds of Osterreichische Nationalbank; Statistik Austria,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Jubilaumsfonds of Oster-reichische Nationalbank (grant 12975).

The microeconomic reforms of the 1990s left behind numerous regulated private service oligopolies that contribute one-quarter. Using an economy-wide modelling approach that represents service oligopoly behaviour explicitly, the extent of sectoral interactions and the potential economy-wide gains from price cap regulation are assessed. Non-linear interaction between oligopoly industries is shown to support economy-wide over sectoral analysis.

The main aim is twofold. Firstly, the authors report regression results indicating that firms that both export and import are the most productive, followed by importing-, exporting-only firms and non-traders. Secondly, they estimate the determinants of the extensive and intensive margins of exports and imports using dynamic panel-Probit and panel-Tobit models in combination with the method proposed by Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (Avoiding biased versions of Wooldridge's simple solution to the initial conditions problem, 2013) to tackle the initial conditions problem. The results show that both activities present a high degree of hysteresis, which is higher for imports than for exports pointing to the existence of sunk costs in both activities. Moreover, past productivity does affect the extensive margin of imports, but not of exports and the initial condition status is also only relevant for the import side. Similar outcomes are obtained for the intensive margin of trade.","[Dolores Parra, Maria] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ CREIP, Res Grp Ind & Terr, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain; [Dolores Parra, Maria; Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37001 Gottingen, Germany",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Jaume I; University of Gottingen,"Parra, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ CREIP, Res Grp Ind & Terr, Reus 43204, Catalonia, Spain.",mparra@eco.uji.es,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557","Universitat Jaume I [P1.1B2013-06, PREDOC/2009/55, E-2012-09]",Universitat Jaume I,"We would like to thank Antonello Maruotti for his comments and useful suggestions and we acknowledge the financial support obtained from the Universitat Jaume I, P1.1B2013-06, PREDOC/2009/55 and E-2012-09.",,47,1,1,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 12,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201538.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-38,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY6ZK,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366557100001,0

We construct a new proxy of shocks to international banks' balance-sheets using credit ratings and the structure of their international assets. This allows us investigating the effect of (foreign) bank balance-sheet shocks on domestic financial turmoil in a large sample of 146 developed and emerging economies from 1984 to 2011. Our proxies of shocks towards bank balance-sheets are strong predictors of systemic banking crises in their debtor countries. Confirming these results, bilateral bank flows significantly decrease when creditor banks' assets are hit by negative shocks, as measured by credit rating downgrades from third-party countries. Short-term liabilities towards global banks appear to increase roll-over and funding risks, thereby amplifying the impact of shocks to foreign lenders' balance-sheets. Domestic banking sectors vulnerabilities, such as illiquid assets and a low deposit-asset ratio, are found to increase crisis contagion risk. In contrast, a high level of global liquidity attenuates the transmission of shocks to international banks' assets to debtor countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To test this hypothesis we conducted 10 male-only, 10 female-only and 10 mixed-gender experimental asset markets, and compared the effects of gender composition, confidence, risk attitude and cognitive skills. Male and female markets have comparable volatility and deviations from fundamentals, whereas mixed-gender markets are substantially more stable. On the other hand, higher average cognitive skills of the group are associated with reduced market volatility. Individual-level analysis shows that subjects with higher cognitive skills trade at prices closer to fundamental values and earn significantly higher profits; similarly, mixed markets exhibit lower mispricing, particularly for traders with lower cognitive skills. Our results are demonstrated to hold in other experimental asset market studies, suggesting that a mixed-gender composition reduces mispricing across different types of asset markets.

The new channel arises in a standard dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model composed of small-open economies that take international output prices as given. Within this framework, a more capital-intensive primary sector implies that natural-resource abundant economies grow more slowly along the adjustment path. This effect might be only temporary because the natural input also affects long-run income, and not necessarily in the same direction as transitional growth. We produce quantitative results that show that the new mechanism can account for a significant fraction of the observed output growth gap between resource rich and resource poor U.S. states.

Not so Unconventional!,METROECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY; CENTRAL BANK,"The European Central Bank's balance sheet has expanded notably, without banks granting more credit, and the overnight interest rate has stayed close to the deposit facility level for long periods of time since the onset of the financial crisis. This appears to go against the logic implicit in the post-Keynesian Horizontalist approach to monetary macroeconomics, which links reserves to credit and holds that a central bank accommodates the demand for reserves in order to control the overnight interest rate. In this article, we analyze the monetary policy implemented by the ECB since the third quarter of 2008, with a view to studying its implications for monetary theory, concluding that this approach can still explain much of what has happened in the Euro Zone in the last troubled years, despite paradoxically, there being excess reserves and simultaneously accepting that reserves are demand led, and that the ECB has lent them at the official rate while the overnight interest rate has been close to the deposit facility rate. Further, this analysis reveals that mainstream monetary theory has not been very useful, because neither the link between reserves and loans nor the relation between reserves and inflation have worked. This leads us to believe that some transmission channels of the monetary policy implemented by the ECB since late 2014, which can be deemed unconventional, will not perform well.","[Febrero, Eladio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Cuenca 16071, Spain; [Uxo, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Talavera De La Reina 45600, Spain; [Dejuan, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Febrero, E (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Av Alfares 44, Cuenca 16071, Spain.",eladio.febrero@uclm.es; jorge.uxo@uclm.es; oscar.dejuan@uclm.es,"Febrero, Eladio/AAB-5335-2019; Uxó, Jorge/AAB-3357-2019; Dejuan, Oscar/E-9203-2017","Febrero, Eladio/0000-0002-0722-9487; Uxó, Jorge/0000-0002-2218-1004; Dejuan, Oscar/0000-0002-9319-6609",,,,,37,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2015,66.0,4,,,,,715,739,,10.1111/meca.12088,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CS8YL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362375700006,0

Our contribution is twofold: firstly, we use the indices provided by the Center for Global Development (CGD) to construct indicators of overall donors' policies performance and donors' policies consistency at the recipient level. Secondly, we assume that the growth-consistency nexus is dynamic and our results suggest that an increase in consistency by one standard deviation increases growth on average by 1,1 percentage point. This result holds for different instrumentation strategies and robustness checks.

The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the IMF literature that identifies the effects of IMF bailouts from the 1970s to the present. We investigate significant elements and consequences of the IMF's bailout policies and implementation approaches such as bailout effectiveness, moral hazard, conditionality, leadership, governance and the sustainability of IMF policy. Based on our review, we develop the 'Spiral of Doom' framework and argue that the effectiveness of the austerity package attached to bailout funds is questionable because the design of the package overlooks the recipient country's unique economic status and cultural background. We then propose financial engineering solutions as an alternative to IMF bailouts which it is envisaged may minimize the moral hazard problem associated with bailouts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Third, although a sufficiently high seizure rate is required to enhance economic growth, such a policy reform would deteriorates welfare in both the North and South.

We focus on the determinants of growth inclusiveness and suggest options for reform. A cross-country empirical analysis suggests that fiscal redistribution, monetary policy aimed at macro stability, and structural reforms to stimulate trade, reduce unemployment and increase productivity are important determinants of inclusive growth. The main policy implication of our analysis is that there is still room to strengthen such policies in Asia to better achieve growth with shared prosperity. In particular, scenario simulations based on our results suggests that the effect of expanding fiscal redistribution on inclusive growth could be sizeable in emerging Asia, since the estimated improvement in our proxy of inclusive growth-a measure of growth in average income corrected'' for the equity impact-ranges from about 1% to about 8% points.

One common explanation is that CSR forces schools to hire low-quality teachers. Prior studies of this hypothesis have been hindered by poor data. Using different data, we find that hiring quality did fall with state-wide CSR. However, this drop was temporary due to attrition by the lowest performers. Furthermore, the drop was similar for schools classified as treated and control for prior evaluations of CSR. Therefore, differences in the quality of incoming teachers cannot explain the estimated performance of CSR. This is consistent with hiring spillovers in connected markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conditional lending provides explicit incentives for fiscal adjustment but immediate liquidity provision is more effective in reducing liquidation costs. For some parameters, immediate liquidity provision induces fiscal adjustment and debt repayment, while conditional lending does not (and vice-versa). Incentives for fiscal adjustment are concave in the fraction of lending provided under conditionalities. A large cost of tight fiscal policy shifts the balance toward immediate liquidity provision.","[Guimaraes, Bernardo; Iazdi, Oz] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Guimaraes, B (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",bernardo.guimaraes@fgv.br,,"Iazdi, Oz/0000-0002-2027-4426; guimaraes, bernardo/0000-0003-0098-2174",CNPq; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the editor Andreas Haufler, Enlinson Mattos, Mauro Rodrigues Jr, Andre Portela Souza, two anonymous referees and seminar participants at the ANPEC Meeting 2013 (Iguacu) and the Sao Paulo School of Economics - FGV for helpful comments.

Specifically, we first confirm whether real consumption in Hong Kong and mainland China satisfies the permanent income hypothesis, at least in a weak form. We then identify the permanent and transitory components of income of each economy using a simple state-space model. We use structural vector autoregression models to analyze how permanent and transitory shocks originating from mainland China and the US affect the Hong Kong economy, and how such influences evolve over time. Our main findings suggest that transitory shocks from the US remain a major driving force behind Hong Kong's business cycle fluctuations.

The importance of basic education coverage offers policymakers an opening toward diversifying exports, at least in the long run.

Existing studies measure the strength of competition based on the number of firms, and show that the optimal degree of privatization is higher in more competitive markets. We introduce an interdependent payoff structure into a mixed oligopoly and revisit this problem. Here, we assume that firms consider their own and other firms' profits. In the model, competition increases when firms are negatively affected by rivals' profits. We find that under the assumption of quadratic production costs, which is popular in mixed oligopolies, the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition. This finding contrasts with those of prior studies. However, this result may be reversed when we adopt alternative model formulation. Furthermore, in the constant marginal cost case, the optimal degree of privatization is always lower when there is less market competition, which is opposite to the result in the quadratic cost case. Our results suggest that the relationship between an optimal privatization policy and the strength of competition crucially depends on the market structure, including the cost conditions.","[Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Okamura, Makoto] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398525, Japan",University of Tokyo; Hiroshima University,"Okamura, M (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, 1-2-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398525, Japan.",andrew-uf@galaxy.plala.or.jp,"Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010","Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516","Murata Science Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI [15k03347]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380340, 15K03436, 15K03492, 24530332, 15K03347] Funding Source: KAKEN","Murata Science Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are indebted to two anonymous referees and the editor for their valuable and constructive suggestions.

It is an important source of income, foreign exchange and workforce for a large number of economies. The most studies dealing with the international migration consider it as efficient instrument for developing countries, because inflow of money (through remittances) has a positive impact on their economy. However, on the other hand, economically developed countries are threatened by outflow of money abroad. From this perspective, remittances may have negative consequences on the economy. This issue connected with remittances is very often neglected. The Czech Republic and most developed European countries are the immigration countries. It means that many foreigners come here because of work or study, especially from non-EU countries. The paper focuses on rarely discussed issues of migration standing on the border between demographics and economic statistics. It deals with positive and negative aspects of labour immigration with the specific focus on foreigners' behaviour incomes, expenditures, savings and remittances.

The Planner's endogenous rankings of human distributions are characterized. These Planner rankings are then used to develop sufficient conditions for positive assortative matching to be dynamically efficient. One lesson that emerges is that complementarity assumptions alone are insufficient for a robust sorting theory the curvature of the static production function is also critical to determine optimal sorting patterns. In addition, the Planner's ranking of distributions over human capital yield characterizations of individual attitudes toward human capital gambles in an associated market equilibrium.

In this case study of farmers in Maine, we identify patterns in their perceptions of the macro-energy environment, adaptation strategies, and anticipated energy challenges. We segment the farms into groups representing small diversified farms and larger commodity farms, and investigate within and across farm sectors to understand farmer strategies for responding to changing energy prices. Significant differences in customs and beliefs, perceptions, and intended institutional changes are found between the small diversified and the larger commodity farms.

The literature in this area is very scant. Earlier studies find that the wife outearns the husband in roughly one of every four dual-earner couples in North-American countries. According to our estimates, the wife earns a higher hourly wage than the husband in one of every six French households, including couples with an inactive partner, and, moreover, this proportion is almost the same considering partners' monthly earnings. Economic models of marriage would predict that the wife's earnings dominance be compensated by the husband being younger or possibly more attractive than the wife. Using a large dataset of couples, drawn from the French Labor Force surveys, we find that larger spousal age differences correlate positively with the occurrence of couples in which only the wife works but negatively with dual-earners in which she outearns the husband. Therefore, a marriage selection type of story may explain the occurrence of female solo-earner households while the emergence of power couples'' may provide a rationale for dual-earners in which the wife outearns the husband.","[Bloemen, Hans G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.; Stancanelli, Elena G.

The paper's objectives are as follows. First, we seek to examine whether we can detect possible insider trading and stock manipulation and react in almost real time, even though insider trading activity is intended to be evasive. Second, we also estimate the extent of illicit profits (or loss avoidance) that might have been earned. Finally, we analyze, if detection is possible, the appropriate response for regulators and other market participants. We do not restrict our study to cases where corporate events have materialized, as we hope to capture insider trading surrounding market rumors and failed corporate events. Because insider trading is executed with the aim of being evasive and undetected, it is impossible to conclude with certainty. Nevertheless, using a hypothesized model based on how insiders and stock manipulators trade, we detect price patterns that are consistent with their objective to maximize profits and at the same time be evasive.","[Dissanaike, Gishan; Lim, Kim-Hwa] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Lim, Kim-Hwa] Penang Inst, George Town 10350, Malaysia",University of Cambridge,"Dissanaike, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",g.dissanaike@jbs.cam.ac.uk; kh.lim@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,33,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Renminbi appreciation has no significant impact on the valuation of firms in sectors exporting to China on average. But this non-result confounds a positive effect on firms in sectors exporting final goods to China with a negligible effect on those providing inputs for China's processing exports. We also find no significant effect on firms in sectors competing with China at home and in third markets. But again this non-result confounds the positive effect on firms competing with China in final goods with an insignificant effect on firms competing with China's processing exports.

We find large differences across the two groups: forecasts for advanced economies are much more accurate than for emerging economies and much less subject to a bias towards optimism (i.e. they are less likely to forecast a bigger budget balance than the realization). Forecasts for both groups, however, exhibit a tendency toward forecast smoothing: forecasts are revised slowly so that revisions to forecasts can be systematically predicted based on past revisions. This tendency proves costly around turning points in the economy when the budget balance moves sharply but the corresponding forecasts only adjust very slowly to the reality of the situation.

In the proposed model, the farms which consume resources (i.e., fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides) to produce cotton are assumed to be the DMUs. Inputs not consumed during a planning period are carried over to the next period in the planning horizon. Initially, a DMS-DEA model is used to determine the overall efficiency of the DMUs with dynamic inputs. Next, the efficiency score of each DMU is calculated for each time period in the planning horizon. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms with a real-life case study of energy consumption in the cotton industry.

J,"Lim, Y; Kim, JY; Berg, N",,,,"Lim, Yoonsung; Kim, Jeong-Yoo; Berg, Nathan",,,Price asymmetry revisited from a marketing perspective,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Asymmetric price adjustment; Marketing; Promotion; Inventory cost,CRUDE-OIL PRICE; GASOLINE PRICES,"Price asymmetry is a longstanding issue in economics that pre-dates Keynes' introduction of the term, price rigidity. Many theories provide possible explanations of price asymmetry. This paper demonstrates that asymmetric marketing decisions based on the inherent asymmetry of inventory costs over the business cycle can generate price asymmetries that match at least one important empirical regularity. The theoretical mechanism we propose follows from the observation that firms face inventory costs proportion to excess supply during recessions, which fall to zero in periods of excess demand. This asymmetry of inventory costs gives firms two incentives during recessions. First, a firm facing excess supply has an incentive to reduce price, seeking to sell larger quantities and thereby reduce inventory costs. The firm may increase its intensity of promotional activity, again seeking to sell larger quantities but with the counterintuitive effect of increasing consumers' willingness to pay which pushes prices higher. If the latter effect dominates the former effect, then prices may not fall much during recessions. A similar phenomenon occurs when the macroeconomic business-cycle faces a cost-side shock.

In a unionized duopoly downstream firms face a trade-off. They choose either to differentiate production to relax final market competition (this pushes wages up), or to reduce it to induce a fiercer upstream competition (pushing wages down). In this way, the degree of product differentiation becomes a valuable tool for downstream firms. When upstream market power is weak, downstream firms do not care about wages and differentiate their products. But as soon as unions' bargaining power increases, wages also increase and downstream firms choose less quality differentiation to reduce them. Thus, the higher the bargaining power of trade unions, the lower the quality gap. This result emerges more strongly when downstream firms merge, and it is robust to the type of competition and the nature of costs.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Mesa-Sánchez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.",franciscoborja.mesa@uc3m.es,,,IVIE; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [2011-30323-C03-03],IVIE; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government),"Department of Economics, Carlos III University of Madrid, Getafe, Madrid, Spain.

By calculating the so-called Thirlwall equation, the main contribution of our research is to examine whether Brazil has been catching up or falling behind. We show some empirical evidence based on both descriptive statistics and econometric regressions for Brazil between 1970 and 2010. Some important indicators of descriptive statistics reveal that Brazil has entered into a process of early deindustrialisation. In addition, since our econometric estimates also show that there was a dramatic increase in the income elasticity of demand for imports between 1980-98 and 1999-2010 (from 1.97 to 3.36) and a small decrease in the income elasticity for exports during the same periods (from 1.36 to 1.33), we conclude that Brazil not only has already embarked on a trajectory of falling behind relative to the world economy and the international economic frontier, but also that it might show, in the absence of appropriate policies, lower growth rates in the long run. However, if the opposite occurs, it would face major long-term external constraints to growth.","[Nassif, Andre; Feijo, Carmem] Univ Fed Fluminense, BR-24230540 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Araujo, Eliane] Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Nassif, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, BR-24230540 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",andrenassif27@gmail.com,"FEIJO, CARMEM/G-6950-2019","FEIJO, CARMEM/0000-0002-6376-4599",,,,,59,34,46,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The analysis is based on a somewhat unconventional approach that refers to concentration curves in the Gini regression framework. It allows identification of ranges in the explanatory variables where local slopes change sign and/or size, i.e. the components that make up a regression coefficient. Gender is a crucial factor differentiating participation among workers, although employment-age profiles do not substantially differ. Relevant differences in age profiles concern working-hours patterns: some countries are characterized by an almost specular behavior in men and women; other countries instead show similar patterns. Generally, earnings increase with age for both men and women. However, local regression coefficients are not monotonic over the entire age range and can even be locally negative in some countries.","[Pittau, M.

All variables were found to be nonstationary and cointegrated based on recent panel data unit-root tests and cointegration techniques. On applying fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOIS), the long-run results suggest the presence of an environmental Kuznets curve. In turn, foreign direct investment increases environmental degradation, thus confirming the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH). Moreover, the bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and foreign direct investment is observed globally. The findings are sensitive to different income groups and regional analyses. In particular, these empirical findings aid sound economic policymaking for improving environmental quality and sustainable economic development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rapid growth of LGFV has triggered concern about local government indebtedness, banks 'asset quality and, more broadly, China's medium-term financial stability and sovereign risk. This paper constructs a unique firm-level dataset to evaluate the country's local government debt. We find an uneven distribution of LGFV, which are concentrated in the coastal areas, and a deterioration of their debt repaying ability from 2010 to 2012. We use principal component analysis (PCA) along with multivariate discriminate analysis (MDA) to identify the credit risk of LGFV based on conventional financial variables as well as local governments 'fiscal status. We also estimate the safe boundaries of debt bearing at the provincial government level. The estimations reveal more severe local government debt risks in the middle-western provinces and higher risks associated with LGFV at the municipal and county levels. Although it is very unlikely that there will be a national debt crisis in China, the high risk of LGFV should be noted and effectively controlled by improving the fiscal transparency of local governments and reforming the fiscal system.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Tao, K (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tina_taokunyu@163.com,,,"US Government Fiscal and Debt Crisis and Its Impacts on China's Economy under the Ministry of Education Social Science Key Research Base China Center for Economic Research, National School of Development, Peking University [12JJD790041]","US Government Fiscal and Debt Crisis and Its Impacts on China's Economy under the Ministry of Education Social Science Key Research Base China Center for Economic Research, National School of Development, Peking University","Kunyu Tao, Assistant Professor, School of Finance, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China.

Indeed, Orcutt (Rev Econ Stat 32:117-132, 1950) conjectures that they respond faster to exchange rate changes than to changes in relative prices. Previous studies tested the hypothesis by imposing lag structure on both the exchange rate and relative prices and judged Orcutt's conjecture by identifying significant lag lengths. In this paper, we rely upon impulse response analysis as an alternative method to test the hypothesis.

The theory predicts that higher aggregate effort will be reached when variation in ability between groups is lower, i.e., by a more balanced sorting. In the experiment, we assign subjects to four types - A, B, C, and D - ranked by their cost of effort, with A having the lowest and D having the highest cost, and conduct contests between two groups of two players each. In the Balanced treatment, (A,D) groups (i.e., groups comprised of a type A and a type D player) compete with (B,C) groups, whereas in the Unbalanced treatment, (A,B) groups compete with (C,D) groups. We find substantial heterogeneity and overinvestment of efforts by all types in both treatments, including the underdog (CD) group which surprisingly is not demoralized by the unbalanced matching.

In this paper, we use variations in the spread and intensity of Somali piracy to estimate its effect on the volume of international trade. By comparing trade volume changes along shipping routes located in pirate waters to those that are not, we estimate that Somali piracy reduced bulk commodities trade passing through the Gulf of Aden by 4.1% per year from 2000 to 2010. We find smaller reductions in total trade, consistent with the fact that not all goods are shipped by sea or are targets of pirate attacks. While our estimates suggest that the trade costs of piracy are much lower than what has been suggested in the existing literature, we find that they remain significant and unevenly distributed, with five countries and the EU shouldering 70% of the total costs.","[Burlando, Alfredo; Cristea, Anca D.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lee, Logan M.] Grinnell Coll, Dept Econ, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA",University of Oregon,"Burlando, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cristea@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,34,14,16,3,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The independence principle, the prominent feature of a demand guarantee, provides certainty of payment, but has brought significant problems into international transactions. Therefore, many jurisdictions recognize the fraud exception as well as the independence principle in a demand guarantee. There have been only two cases decided by the Supreme Court of Korea as to the independence principle and the fraud exception in a demand guarantee in international transactions.

It develops an analysis of demand for certain products during a recent economic recession in Spain by showing the behaviour of some of them as Giffen goods in some years. According to the theory of Giffen demand, there is a direct (positive) relationship between price and the quantity demanded. Thus, the income effect outweighs the substitution effect. The main contributions of this work can be summarized in the next three points: 1) This paper studies the consumer behaviour from a Giffen perspective, beyond a traditional and rational utility approach; 2) It also suggests a framework to analyse several socioeconomic proposals and theories related to the sustainability and Human Rights-based ethic level (intrinsic to Giffen behaviour); 3) Finally, this theory is a significant contribution to design better economic policies. The analysis of Giffen phenomenon has greater explanatory power than the classical theory of Marshall. It also helps to reveal a number of important effects that are usually ignored and that could contribute to clarify some current economic phenomena.","Univ Extremadura, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Caceres 10004, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Franco, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Law, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Caceres 10004, Spain.",franco@unex.es,"Martínez, J.

To that end, we present a spatially augmented stochastic growth model with technological interdependence among economies. Spatial externalities are used to model technological interdependence, which ultimately implies that the economic growth rate of a particular region is affected not only by its own degree of volatility but also by the output fluctuations experienced by the remaining regions. In order to investigate the empirical validity of this result, we examine the link between volatility and economic growth in a sample of 272 European regions over the period 1991-2011 using spatial econometric techniques. Our estimates show the existence of a negative and statistically significant relationship between volatility and economic performance in the European regions. This is partly due to the role played by spatial spillovers induced by volatility in neighbouring regions. The observed relationship is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of different explanatory variables that may affect both regional growth and business cycle fluctuations. We also check that our results do not depend on the measure or volatility used in the analysis or the econometric specification employed to capture the nature of spatial spillovers.","[Ezcurra, Roberto; Rios, Vicente] Univ Publ Navarra, Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Ezcurra, R (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",roberto.ezcurra@unavarra.es; vicente.rios@unavarra.es,"Rios, Vicente/GPP-4330-2022; RIOS, VICENTE/ABE-8312-2020","RIOS, VICENTE/0000-0002-9678-1379",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-29314-C02-01],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and participants at the ERSA 2013 conference, and the 6th Seminar Jean Paelinck for their useful comments and suggestions to earlier versions of the article.

By examining the case of Taiwanese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), this paper is marked out from existing studies in the following three respects. First, it examines the extent to which the relationship between OFDI and domestic investment varies with the location of investment. Second, this research allows the results to vary between Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) industries and Schumpeter industries. Finally, its breakdown of data will reveal sub-relationships in the data that up to now have remained hidden within the aggregate relationships reported in most studies. This study suggests that OFDI in China has a positive impact on domestic investment in H-O industries, while OFDI in other countries (OFDIO) has a negative impact on domestic investment in the same industries. These findings are in marked contrast to Schumpeter industries where a positive effect is observed only for OFDIO. Our findings also suggest that the Taiwanese government should design policies to adjust the level of liberalisation for overseas investment through legislation on an industry-by-industry basis in order that OFDI stimulates domestic investment in relevant industries more effectively.","[Hsu, Wen Chung] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli 54561, Nantou, Taiwan; [Wang, Chengqi] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Clegg, Jeremy] Univ Leeds, Ctr Int Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",National Chi Nan University; University of Nottingham; University of Leeds,"Hsu, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, 470 Univ Rd, Puli 54561, Nantou, Taiwan.",wchsu@ncnu.edu.tw,"Wang, Chengqi/AAS-5055-2021",,,,,,26,7,7,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The empirical findings show that a larger pool of migrants in the skilled professions is associated with higher levels of knowledge creation. Skilled migrants contribute both to the creation of private knowledge, measured by the number of patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty, and to more public basic research, measured by the number of citations to published articles. This finding is robust, in that it uses both an occupation-based and an education-based index of skilled migration, as well as an instrumental variable estimation accounting for the endogeneity of the skilled migrants indicator and to a number of robustness checks. Our results suggest that policy efforts aiming at attracting skilled migrants to Europe and employing them in skilled professions, such as those put forward in the Europe 2020 Strategy, will indeed foster EU competitiveness in innovation.

Several recent papers, using different estimators and different data sets, conclude that the Zipf Law, in particular, provides a good fit, implying that the fraction of firms with size above a given value is inversely proportional to the value itself. In this article we compare the asymptotic and small sample properties of different methods through which this conclusion has been reached. We find that the family of estimators most widely adopted, based on an OLS regression, is in fact unreliable and basically useless for appropriate inference. This finding raises doubts about previously identified Zipf behavior. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we recommend the adoption of the Hill estimator over any other method when individual observations are available.","[Bottazzi, Giulio; Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, IE, Pisa, Italy; [Bottazzi, Giulio; Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy; [Pirino, Davide] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, IE, Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020; Pirino, Davide/A-7096-2012","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; PIRINO, DAVIDE ERMINIO/0000-0001-6062-1800",Italian Ministry of University and Research [prot. 2009H8WPX5],"Italian Ministry of University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was partially supported by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, grant PRIN 2009 The growth of firms and countries: distributional properties and economic determinants, prot. 2009H8WPX5.",,33,23,24,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Second, we investigate the direction of the causality. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we investigate if the relationship between fiscal decentralization and income inequality is conditional on income in each state.

The confidence sets are valid for the broad setting of a system of multivariate linear regression equations under fairly general assumptions about the error and regressors, and allowing for multiple breaks in mean and variance parameters. In our asymptotic analysis, we determine the critical values for a likelihood ratio test of a break date and the expected length of a confidence set constructed by inverting the likelihood ratio test. Notably, the likelihood-ratio-based confidence sets are more precise than other confidence sets considered in the literature. Monte Carlo analysis confirms their greater precision in finite samples, including in terms of maintaining accurate coverage even when the sample size or magnitude of a break is small. An application to postwar U.S. real gross domestic product and consumption leads to a shorter 95% confidence set for the timing of the Great Moderation in the mid-1980s than previously found in the literature. Furthermore, when taking co-integration between output and consumption into account, confidence sets for structural break dates become even shorter and suggest a productivity growth slowdown in the early 1970s and an additional large, abrupt decline in long-run growth in the mid-1990s.","[Eo, Yunjong] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Morley, James] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Eo, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",yunjong.eo@sydney.edu.au; james.morley@unsw.edu.au,"Eo, Yunjong/J-4319-2012; Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Eo, Yunjong/0000-0002-9172-2265; Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,30,26,30,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Competition in only one price component (the fee or the rate) may allow both firms to enjoy positive profits if the other price component has been set at levels different enough between firms. Fixing one price component alters the nature of competition, indirectly introducing an element of product differentiation. Endogenous market segmentation emerges, with the heavier users choosing the lower rate firm and the lighter users choosing the lower fee firm. When no price component can be negative, competition becomes softer, profits tend to be higher but there is also a disadvantage for the firm that starts with a higher fee than that of its rival.

The expected welfare of the mechanism is, approximately, at least that of the algorithm on the agents' true preferences. The construction is based on a maximum weight matching in the type space of each agent that be calculated quickly when the type spaces are reasonably sized. Furthermore, the computation can be performed independently for each agent and, therefore, scales well with the number of agents.

Given the presence of a financial crisis such as the one that struck the global economy from 2007 onward, did the underlying institutional structure of a country help to mitigate the effects of the crisis on banks? Utilizing a new database of 1600 banks across 30 transition economies, this paper applies Bayesian model averaging, fixed-effects, and IV-GMM methodology to test the effect of institutions on bank profitability in a crisis period. Results are conclusive across models that investor-specific property rights aided bank profitability during the crisis. The effect of democracy on banks is much more ambiguous but appears to negatively influence profitability indirectly through interest group channels and bank concentration. These results hold across a variety of specifications and robustness tests.","[Hartwell, Christopher] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Hartwell, Christopher] CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Hartwell, C (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",chartwell@kozminski.edu.pl,"Hartwell, Christopher A./J-1542-2019","Hartwell, Christopher A./0000-0003-3340-1276",,,,,45,8,8,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In this paper, we highlight the misspecification that results from ignoring this aspect, and its empirical implications - biased estimates of price elasticities and other measures - and provide a relatively simple and empirically practicable way to rectify it, which has a strong theoretical grounding. To do so, we develop an explicit model of consumer behaviour in which utility derives from consumption of energy services rather than from the energy sources that are used to produce them. As we discuss, this approach opens up the possibility of examining many aspects of energy demand in a theoretically sound way that have not previously been considered on a widespread basis, although some existing empirical work could be interpreted as being consistent with this type of specification. While this formulation yields demand equations for energy services rather than for energy or particular energy sources, these are shown to be readily converted, without added complexity, into the standard type of energy demand equation(s) that is (are) typically estimated. The additional terms that the resulting energy demand equations include, compared to those that are typically estimated, highlight the misspecification that is implicit when typical energy demand equations are estimated. A simple solution for dealing with an apparent drawback of this formulation for empirical purposes, namely that information is required on typically unobserved energy efficiency, indicates how energy efficiency can be captured in the model, such as by including exogenous trends and/or including its possible dependence on past energy prices. The approach is illustrated using an empirical example that involves estimation of an aggregate energy demand function for the UK with data over the period 1960-2011. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The second purpose of our paper is to analyze the relation between the evolution of the functional distribution of income and labor policy, with special emphasis on minimum wage policy. Finally our third objective, closely linked to the previous two, is the examination of the institutional context as well as the ideological and political economy considerations that have marked minimum wage policy in Mexico in view of the successful attempt to bring the debate back to the forefront of the political agenda. As such, our analysis will pay special attention to events since May 1st 2014, when the Chief of the Government of Mexico City launched a national discussion on the urgent need, ways and means to renovate minimum wage policy in Mexico. In our view, this debate is perhaps the only recent expression in Mexico of the current re-found concerted focus on inequality on a global scale, an expression that has woken up fierce opposition from key sectors of the Mexican elite and highly placed government officers in the current administration.","[Krozer, Alice] Univ Cambridge, Dev Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Moreno Brid, Juan Carlos] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",University of Cambridge; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Krozer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dev Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",alicia.krozer@gmail.com; juancarlosmorenobrid@gmail.com; juanrubiobadan@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,7,8,1,11,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

After briefly clarifying the difference between making generalizations about groups, on the one hand, and making valid inferences from samples, on the other, this essay suggests improvements to how economists communicate our research results. Supplementing findings of statistical significance with quantitative measures of both substantive difference (Cohen's d, a measure in common use in non-Economics literatures) and of substantive overlap (the Index of Similarity, newly proposed here) adds important nuance to the discussion of sex differences. These measures are computed from the data on men, women and risk used in 35 scholarly works from economics, finance and decision science. The results are considerably more mixed and overlapping than would commonly be inferred from the broad claims made in the literature, with standardized differences in means mostly amounting to considerably less than one standard deviation, and the degree of overlap between male and female distributions generally exceeding 80%. In addition, studies that look at contextual influences suggest that these contribute importantly to observations of differences both between and within the sexes.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Nelson, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,"Funding for this project was provided by the Institute for New Economic Thinking.

Recently, the Russian government has considered reducing export taxes on crude oil and oil products compensated by an increase in the royalty on crude oil. The objective of the paper is to analyse the economy-wide effects of this proposal. Moreover, a hypothetical replacement of export taxes and royalties with a pure rent tax is analysed. A static, single-country, multi-sector computable generation equilibrium (CGE) model is employed. The primary findings are as follows. A replacement of export taxes on crude oil and oil products with a royalty on crude oil provides substantial allocative efficiency gains, but this policy is not a superior one. Welfare could be substantially improved when the export taxes and royalty are replaced with a pure rent tax that can be implemented in the form of a cash-flow tax. On the negative side, reducing export taxes on crude oil and oil products results in a strong appreciation of the currency. As a result, domestic producers become less competitive in domestic markets, and there is a massive increase in import demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce these two features in a New Keynesian model and revisit the effects of fiscal consolidations. VAR evidence for Italy suggests that spending cuts reduce tax evasion, while tax hikes increase it. In the model, spending cuts induce a reallocation of production towards the formal sector, thus reducing tax evasion. Tax hikes increase the incentives to produce in the less productive shadow sector, implying higher output and unemployment losses. Corruption further amplifies these losses by requiring larger hikes in taxes to reduce debt. We use the model to assess the recent fiscal consolidation plans in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Our results corroborate the evidence of increasing levels of tax evasion during these consolidations and point to significant output and welfare losses, which could be reduced substantially by combating tax evasion and corruption.

The results of the analysis show that the response of firms to both types of shocks is not symmetrical in general, and that firms react to these shocks combining adjustment strategies (mostly choosing to reduce costs) to smooth the pass-through to prices and production. Stronger competition makes firms use the adjustment strategies more intensively, and it encourages price flexibility. For all shocks, the costs more likely to be reduced are non-labor costs, followed by temporary employment. A high degree of competition and a high labor share make the pass-through of shocks to employment stronger. On the other hand, collective wage agreements smooth this pass-through. No pass-through of shocks to wages is observed, which combined with a low observed incidence of reducing base salaries shows nominal wage rigidity in the firms surveyed.","[Sanchez-Romeu, Paula; Rattia Lima, Ernesto] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Sánchez-Romeu, P (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",psanchez@banxico.org.mx; erattia@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,48,0,0,3,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The proportion of non-performing loans is rising continuously. We constructed a model to find those factors which have significant effect on the probability of default of households' mortgages. We also used this model to calibrate the optimal level of household mortgages' payment-to-income ratios, which is important from a regulatory point of view. Our results show that the denomination of the loan and the indebtedness of the household are crucial factors in the performance of the loan. We also show that loans contracted via agents are riskier than others. The results carry two important messages from a regulatory perspective. Prescribing the same payment-to-income (PTI) ratios for HUF and FX loans may be unnecessarily restrictive for the former and excessively permissive for the latter.

Even so, this question has received no theoretical attention in the literature. Hence, we use contract theory to provide the first theoretical analysis of the optimal provision of transport infrastructure by an asymmetrically informed tourist agency (TA) interested in promoting a particular destination to tourists. Specifically, we first delineate our model and then solve for the first-best contract describing the interaction between the TA and a transport infrastructure providing firm. Second, we study the optimal second-best contract with asymmetric information when the above firm can be of two possible types. Third, we generalize the previous analysis by analyzing the case in which the firm can be of infinitely many types. Finally, we note that policy makers can reduce the negative effects of asymmetric information in practical settings by engaging in underwriting or obtaining additional information, by asking the firm to provide references, and by inspecting past transport infrastructure projects completed by the firm.

We studied its impact on work performance in a laboratory experiment by either allowing or restricting Internet access. We used a 2 x 2 experimental design in which subjects completing real-effort work tasks could earn cash according to either individual- or team-production incentive schemes. Under team pay, production levels were significantly lower when Internet browsing was available than when it was not. Under individual pay, however, no differences in production levels were observed between the treatment in which Internet was available and the treatment in which it was not. In line with standard incentive theory, individual pay outperformed team pay across all periods of the experiment when Internet browsing was available. This was not the case, however, when Internet browsing was unavailable. These results demonstrate that the integration of on-the-job leisure activities into an experimental labor design is crucial for uncovering incentive effects.","[Corgnet, Brice; Schniter, Eric] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Hernan-Gonzalez, Roberto] Univ Granada, Dept Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Granada,"Corgnet, B (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Econ Sci Inst, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",corgnet@chapman.edu; roberto.hernangonzalez@gmail.com; eschniter@gmail.com,"Schniter, Eric/AAC-3583-2019; Corgnet, Brice/G-7917-2017","Schniter, Eric/0000-0002-2381-3616; Corgnet, Brice/0000-0003-0086-8523",,,,,41,50,54,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

To highlight the role of SDP, I contrast the SDP model's responses across invoicing regimes with those from a time-dependent pricing (TDP) model identical to SDP except exogenous price adjustment. While SDP gives rise to different aggregate responses across invoicing currency regimes, TDP, which Dotsey and Duarte (2011) use in their analysis, fails to make a difference in the aggregate responses except in trade balance.

This paper theoretically studies the impact of economic growth with demographic transitions and food safety on food prices, providing a background for policies to protect consumers. The results imply that the sources of food price hikes are (a) Economic Growth; (b) Population Growth Accompanied by an Expansion in the Income Gap; (c) Remarkable Population Growth in the Past; and (d) Deterioration in the Safety of Foods Made in the South. In the North, (d) is the most important factor: besides, (a) and (b) 'in the South' would affect global food prices, while food price hikes are inseparable from economic advancement in the South. Accordingly, guaranteeing the food safety of Southern foods leads to stable food prices in the North, whereas as long as economic advancement in the South continues, encouraging policies that artificially promote stable food prices and ensure food safety will be needed for both developing and developed countries.

The paper argues that this supranational institutionalization of such an approach has been contributing to legitimate a subordinated and exclusive pattern of integration to networks governed by the transnational fraction of capital rather than constituting a tool for enabling the strategies of developing countries and their actors. This is made possible through the transformation of the GVC into a neoliberal device for strategies implemented by global political networks as well as through the uncritical assimilation of a group of limitations in the GVC theoretical and methodological corpus, when those global political networks incorporate that theoretical approach. The paper concludes by suggesting the necessity of a new approach capable of overcoming the limitations of the GVC inspired policy prescriptions as a condition for forging global alternatives to neoliberal fast policies dominating the Global South.","Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina",National University of the Littoral; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Fernández, VR (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Pedro Diaz Colodrero 2462, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",rfernand@fcjs.unl.edu.ar,,,,,,,88,19,27,0,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study for 1992-2006, we show that the share of risky assets in portfolios of two-person households increases with the risk tolerance of the spouse who has more bargaining power. The risk tolerance of the spouse who has less bargaining power does not seem to affect the share of household wealth allocated to risky assets. These results are consistent with a cooperative bargaining framework where the investment in risky assets depends on the bargaining power of the more risk tolerant spouse.","[Yilmazer, Tansel] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lich, Stephen] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Yilmazer, T (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, 1787 Neil Ave,265E Campbell Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",yilmazer.2@osu.edu; swlt@email.unc.edu,"Yilmazer, Tansel/HNS-8728-2023","Yilmazer, Tansel/0000-0002-8143-3427",,,,,42,20,24,5,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The economy, like society, represents a complex of institutions, ranging from the smallest, such as the family, to the largest and most comprehensive, the state (Chavance 2009). Institutional economics offers a broad perspective that brings forward the concept of gender, since gender is a fundamental organizing principle of institutions (Jacobsen 2003). A focus on social provisioning, typical for both feminist as well as institutional economists, leads to a broader understanding of economic activity. This broader approach includes activities like caring and care labor that cannot be entirely understood in terms of individual choices. In this paper, I explore the relationships between care and the economy from the perspective of neoclassical, institutional, and feminist economic theory. Economic theories are a basis for public policies that have a major impact on people's lives. I argue that changing the dominating economic perspective into feminist-institutional one would improve the situation of care providers, who would, in turn, contribute to the development of society and the economy.","Jagiellonian Univ, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Zachorowska-Mazurkiewicz, A (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland.",,"Zachorowska-Mazurkiewicz, Anna/R-2691-2019","Zachorowska-Mazurkiewicz, Anna/0000-0003-4313-5207",Norway Grants in the Polish-Norwegian Research Programme,Norway Grants in the Polish-Norwegian Research Programme,Anna Zachorowska-Mazurkiewicz is an assistant professor at the Jagiellonian University (Poland).

We find that this variation has a significant initial impact on mothers' employment, but this effect quickly disappears, suggesting little evidence of longer-term employment impacts of mothers' absence from the workforce when they have young children.","[Zhu, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bradbury, Bruce] Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Zhu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",anna.zhu@gmail.com,"Bradbury, Bruce/AAD-4140-2021; Zhu, Anna/N-7447-2015","Zhu, Anna/0000-0002-1671-5428; Bradbury, Bruce/0000-0002-0718-1399",,,,,41,2,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

To do so, we perform a two-stage model using PISA 2009 and 2012 databases. In the first stage, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate efficiency scores, which are then regressed on school and student contextual variables. This second stage is carried out using four alternative models: a conventional censored regression and three different regression models based on the use of bootstrapping recently proposed in the literature. Our results show that educational efficiency in Uruguayan high schools significantly dropped in nine percentage points between 2009 and 2012. In terms of educational policy recommendations, in order to reduce the inefficiencies in the evaluated public schools in Uruguay, the focus should be put on reducing grade-retention levels and promoting teaching-learning techniques that enhance student's mathematics study skills and assessing students continuously through test and homework throughout the academic year. In this vein, our findings also show positive effects on public schools' efficiency of providing the responsibility in the distribution of the school budget to school principals.","[Santin, Daniel; Sicilia, Gabriela] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Sicilia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 6, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",gabriels@ucm.es,"Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016; Sicilia, Gabriela/Y-4657-2019","Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659; Sicilia, Gabriela/0000-0002-1078-7762",,,,,41,22,23,1,32,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

This paper proposes an integrated method that combines B&B (branch and bound)-based hybrid feature selection (BBHFS) with the imbalanceoriented multiple-classifier ensemble (IOMCE) for imbalanced credit risk assessment and uses the support vector machine (SVM) and the multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) as the base predictor. BBHFS is a hybrid feature selection method that integrates the t-test and B&B with the k-fold crossvalidation method to search for a satisfactory feature subset. The IOMCE divides majority samples into several subsets and then combines them with minority samples to construct several training sets for constructing a multiple-classifier ensemble model. We conduct main experiments using a 1:3 imbalanced corporate credit risk data set with continuous features and extended experiments using a 1:5 imbalanced data set with continuous features and a 1:3 imbalanced data set with discrete and nominal features. We combine no feature selection and five feature selection methods (the pure B&B, the factor analysis, the pure t-test, t-test & correlation analysis, and BBHFS) with single-classifier and the IOMCE to construct SVM and MDA models for an empirical comparison. When all features are continuous, the BBHFS-IOMCE method generally outperforms all the other methods. More specifically, BBHFS provides more stable and satisfactory results than the other feature selection methods, and compared with single-classifier models, IOMCE models can significantly enhance the recognition rate for minority samples while incurring a small reduction in the recognition rate for majority samples and maintaining an acceptable overall accuracy. When the features are almost discrete or nominal, the IOMCE method retains its ability to deal with an imbalanced data set, although the five feature selection methods have no significant advantages over no feature selection. This suggests that BBHFS is effective in retaining useful information when reducing the dimensionality of continuous features and that the BBHFS-IOMCE method is an important tool for imbalanced credit risk assessment.","[Sun, Jie; Li, Hui; Huang, Qing-Hua] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jie; Lee, Young-Chan] Dongguk Univ, Coll Management & Tourism, Gyeongju 780714, Gyeongbuk, South Korea",Zhejiang Normal University; Dongguk University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",lihuihit@gmail.com,"Sun, Jie/AAE-8538-2020; Li, Hui/G-6408-2011","Lee, Young-Chan/0000-0003-3715-5279; Li, Hui/0000-0002-5822-2795","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371171, 71171179]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [13YJC630140]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation [LY13G010001]; Zhejiang Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Foundation - Zhijiang Young Talent of Social Science [11ZJQN082YB]; Zhejiang Provincial National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [LR13G010001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Zhejiang Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Foundation - Zhijiang Young Talent of Social Science; Zhejiang Provincial National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71371171, No. 71171179), the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 13YJC630140), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (LY13G010001), the Zhejiang Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Foundation - Zhijiang Young Talent of Social Science (11ZJQN082YB), the Zhejiang Provincial National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (No. LR13G010001).

Results from a discrete choice experiment analyzed using mixed logit regressions show that, all else constant, price-per-gallon and miles-per-gallon dominated preferences for fuel attributes but ethanol content made the average consumer more likely to choose a blend fuel. Findings provide strong evidence of heterogeneity in preferences driven by attitudes but also affected by age and income. At a point of price per mile equivalence for ethanol and gasoline, in a market where gasoline, E20 and E85 were available with no regulatory, supply or technological constraints, E85 would dominate market share. In this case ethanol would account for 56% of volume of motor fuels consumed.

We examine the consequences of letting members of society vote between those two principles, in a context where individuals must join with others into coalitions of a certain size to become productive. Our setup induces a hedonic game of coalition formation. We study the existence of core stable partitions (organizational structures) of this game. We show that the inability of voters to commit to one distributional rule or another is a potential source of instability. But we also prove that, when stable organizational structures exist, they may be rich in form, and different than those predicted by alternative models of coalition formation. Non-segregated coalitions may arise within core stable structures. Stability is also compatible with the coexistence of meritocratic and egalitarian coalitions. These phenomena are robust, and persist under alternative variants of our initial model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we study the demand structure between bestsellers and new artists' productions in the music industry. We set up an experiment where participants face real choice's situations. We create three treatments to isolate the effect of information and incentives on diversity. In a first treatment, music is consumed for free without information. In a second one, subjects receive a prior information on others' evaluation of songs to study the effect of word-of-mouth. Finally, in a third one, a real market is introduced and music is bought. Significant evidence shows that word-of-mouth lowers diversity, while price incentives tend to lift it. In both treatments, subjects also react to the information or incentives nature.","[Berlin, Noemi] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bernard, Anna] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Fuerst, Guillaume] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Edinburgh; Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Geneva,"Bernard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Noemi.Berlin@ed.ac.uk; anna.bernard@univ-paris1.fr; guillaume.fuerst@unige.ch,"Bernard, Anna/AAF-4227-2020","Bernard, Anna/0000-0001-7224-9436",[ANR-10-CREA-008],,"Our experiment was possible thanks to the project's Grant ANR-10-CREA-008.

We develop this idea in a model of Bertrand price competition. In equilibrium, one firm enters the market and makes choices that are unpredictable to its competitors. This prevents price undercuts and keeps other firms out of the market. The entrant firm collects the monopoly rent despite the existence of potential competitors. This result raises an alert for regulatory practices based on the conventional wisdom that contestability is associated with low prices and profits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize a general class of utility representations called hidden action representations, which interpret an intrinsic preference for timing of resolution of uncertainty as if an unobservable action is taken between the resolution of the two periods of information arrival. These representations permit a richer class of preferences for timing than was possible in the model of [Kreps and Porteus, 1978] by incorporating a preference for flexibility.

We test whether this was true in the first wave of globalization by constructing market potential measures for a sample of 27 countries in 1900 and 1910 based on a general equilibrium model of production and trade. Cross-sectional estimates suggest that market potential was an economically significant determinant of GDP per capita at this time. To assess welfare effects, we then study the general equilibrium impact of raising market potential by eliminating international borders in a quantitative counterfactual calculation for 1900. There are significant gains in real income per capita for all nations. We use US per capita output as a benchmark, since it attained leadership in this variable from the late 19th century and the literature frequently attributes this to its relatively large domestic market - a market unconstrained by trade costs associated with international borders. Because market potential was already near that of the US, the largest European countries do not entirely close their per capita income gaps with the US after removing all border barriers to trade within Europe or even globally. On the other hand, many small European countries could have done so. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This ranking is separable in terms of rows and columns, and continuous and monotonic in the basic quantities. Owing to the theory of additive separability developed here, we derive very precise numerical representations over a large class of domains (i.e., typically not of the Cartesian product form). We apply these representations to (1) streams of commodity baskets through time, (2) uncertain social prospects, (3) uncertain individual prospects. Concerning (1), we propose a finite horizon variant of Koopmans's (1960) [25] axiomatization of infinite discounted utility sums. The main results concern (2). We push the classic comparison between the ex ante and export social welfare criteria one step further by avoiding any expected utility assumptions, and as a consequence obtain what appears to be the strongest existing form of Harsanyi's (1955) [21] Aggregation Theorem. Concerning (3), we derive a subjective probability for Anscombe and Aumann's (1963) [1] finite case by merely assuming that there are two epistemically independent sources of uncertainty.

We use Finland as an example of a country where substantial amounts of new resources have recently been devoted to shadow economy inspections at the same time as new regulations have been introduced to curtail shadow economy activities. Thus far, the fiscal results appear to be very modest. We use new micro data from the Finnish Tax Administration's tax audits to examine the reasons for this disappointing result. It appears that, to a large extent, the explanation is related to the small size of the shadow economy firms, poor economic performance of the firms, the judicial forms of the firms, and to foreign ownership. Against this background it does not seem likely that much more revenue could be generated from the shadow economy activities in the future. It may also be that the result reflects the fact that the shadow economy is, after all, much smaller than what is argued in public debate.","[Viren, Matti] Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Viren, Matti] Univ Turku, Turku 20014, Finland",Bank of Finland; University of Turku,"Viren, M (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland.",matvir@utu.fi,,,,,,,31,1,2,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Much is hidden in innovative tax shelters combining multiple business structures such as partnerships, trusts, and S-corporations into complex transaction networks designed to reduce and obscure the true tax liabilities of their individual shareholders. One known gambit employed by these shelters is to offset real gains in one part of a portfolio by creating artificial capital losses elsewhere through the mechanism of inflated basis (TaxAnalysts 2005), a process made easier by the relatively flexible set of rules surrounding pass-through entities such as partnerships (IRS 2009). The ability to anticipate the likely forms of emerging evasion schemes would help auditors develop more efficient methods of reducing the tax gap. To this end, we have developed a prototype evolutionary algorithm designed to generate potential schemes of the inflated basis type described above. The algorithm takes as inputs a collection of asset types and tax entities, together with a rule-set governing asset exchanges between these entities. The schemes produced by the algorithm consist of sequences of transactions within an ownership network of tax entities. Schemes are ranked according to a fitness function (Goldberg in Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1989); the very best schemes are those that afford the highest reduction in tax liability while incurring the lowest expected penalty.","[Warner, Geoffrey; Wijesinghe, Sanith; Marques, Uma] Mitre Corp, Mclean, VA 22102 USA; [Badar, Osama; Rosen, Jacob; Hemberg, Erik; O'Reilly, Una-May] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",MITRE Corporation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wijesinghe, S (通讯作者)，Mitre Corp, 7515 Colshire Dr, Mclean, VA 22102 USA.",gwarner@mitre.org; sanith@mitre.org,,,MITRE Corporation Innovation Program,MITRE Corporation Innovation Program,"The authors would like to thank Alan Plumley, Kim Bloomquist, Amalia Miller and the journal reviewers for their helpful comments and feedback.

The study uses monthly frequency time series data from 2001 to 2013. Because historical consumption data are not available, the error correction econometric model employs a reduced form equation in which gasoline prices are functionally dependent on several explanatory variables. Out-of-sample price simulations are compared against random walk and random walk with drift benchmarks.

Each agent lives for two periods and interacts with agents from the previous and next generations via a coordination game. Social norms emerge as patterns of behaviour that are stable in part due to agents' interpretations of private information about the past, influenced by occasional commonly observed past behaviours. For sufficiently backward-looking societies, history completely drives equilibrium play, leading to a social norm of high or low cooperation. In more forward-looking societies, there is a pattern of reversion whereby play starting with high (low) cooperation reverts towards lower (higher) cooperation. The impact of history can be countered by occasional prominent agents, whose actions are visible by all future agents and who can leverage their greater visibility to influence expectations of future agents and overturn social norms of low cooperation.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Jackson, Matthew O.] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jackson, Matthew O.] Stanford Univ, Santa Fe Inst, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); The Santa Fe Institute; Stanford University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","Jackson, Matthew O./0000-0001-9846-4249","ARO MURI award [W911NF-12-1-0509]; NSF [SES-0961481, SES-0729361]",ARO MURI award(MURI); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank David Jimenez-Gomez and Pascual Restrepo for excellent research assistance and several useful suggestions, as well as Attila Ambrus, Sam Bowles, Jon Eguia, and Luca Sessa for comments on previous versions.

Consumers may act as tax enforcers by requesting sales receipts, forcing firms to remit taxes to the government. Consumer auditing is costly, and the government offers buyers a tax rebate. This policy modifies the traditional 'Ramsey equation' due to a non-trivial income effect. We show that tax enforcement policies affect buyers' allocations directly via the standard changes in the good's price. We characterize the planner's policy trade-off when choosing alternative enforcement instruments. We illustrate numerically the relevance of the individuals' auditing and firms' concealment technologies for the determination of optimal policies and show that the economy's welfare is higher when the government has two auditing policies at its disposal vis-A -vis direct auditing only.","[Arbex, Marcelo] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Mattos, Enlinson] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of Windsor; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Arbex, M (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",arbex@uwindsor.ca; enlinson.mattos@fgv.br,"Arbex, Marcelo/ABC-2901-2020","ARBEX, MARCELO/0000-0002-5506-2669",Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPq-PQ1D) [301036/2011-0],Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPq-PQ1D),"Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa Cientifica (CNPq-PQ1D, 301036/2011-0 to E.M.).",,41,6,6,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Correspondingly, endowing agents with fears about misspecification is more costly when there is already idiosyncratic risk.","[Ellison, Martin] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2UQ, England; [Sargent, Thomas J.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Sargent, Thomas J.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA USA",University of Oxford; New York University,"Ellison, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 2UQ, England.",martin.ellison@economics.ox.ac.uk; thomas.sargent@nyu.edu,,,British Academy; Oxford Fidelity Research Fund,British Academy; Oxford Fidelity Research Fund,"We thank three anonymous referees and Evan Anderson for helpful comments, and Pascal Paul for excellent research assistance.

We find that optimal policy when technology licensing is possible can be very different from optimal policy in the standard strategic trade policy set-up where the possibility of technology licensing is ignored. For example, we find that in a differentiated duopoly with price competition, optimal policy can be an export subsidy and not an export tax. Also, unlike results regarding strategic trade policy with asymmetric costs, optimal policy for a government when technology licensing is possible is neither necessarily (a) higher in absolute value, the more cost-competitive its domestic firm, nor (b) monotonically related to the extent of cost-competitiveness of its domestic firm. Furthermore, we find cases in which welfare is lower when technology licensing is possible than in circumstances where technology licensing is not allowed. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article presents an experiment on the determinants of whether alliances break up and fight internally after having defeated a joint enemy. First, if peaceful sharing yields an asymmetric rent distribution, this increases the likelihood of fighting. In turn, anticipation of the higher likelihood of internal fight reduces the alliance's ability to succeed against the outside enemy. Second, the option to make nonbinding nonaggression declarations between alliance members does not make peaceful settlement within the alliance more likely. Third, higher differences in the alliance players' contributions to alliance effort lead to more internal conflict and more intense fighting.

We investigate the behavior of the general price level in a context where a firm can either pay a cost (featuring a random component) to update its information set and establish the optimal price (Nash strategy) or freely use non-updated information and establish a lagged optimal price (bounded rationality strategy). We devise evolutionary microdynamics (with and without mutation) that, by interacting with the dynamics of the aggregate variables, determines the coevolution of the frequency distribution of information-updating strategies in the population of firms and the extent of the nominal adjustment of the general price level to a monetary shock. As it turns out, evolutionary learning dynamics take the information-updating process to a long-run equilibrium configuration in which, albeit either most or even all firms play the bounded rationality strategy, the general price level is the symmetric Nash equilibrium price and the monetary shocks have persistent, although not permanent, impacts on real output.

The analytical analysis shows that medium-skill immigration decreases low-skilled unemployment under the flexible regime, indicating a complementarity effect, while the rigid regime induces a substitution effect, leading to low-skilled unemployment. Moreover, it leads to wage polarization.

TELRIC, which bases prices on a hypothetical incumbent that serves current volumes with completely new equipment, was a major departure from the predominant use of historical (or original) costs for regulated prices. The FCC made two exceptions: total service resale of local exchange services and rental of space by cable television providers and competitive local exchange carriers on poles and conduit owned by electric utilities and ILECs are based on original cost calculations. The FCC's use of both current cost and historical cost methodologies recalls the fierce debates over whether regulated rates should be based on replacement (current) costs or original (historical costs) that preceded the US Supreme Court's 1944 FPC v Hope decision. Parties advocating low rates favored replacement costs when equipment costs were expected to decrease, but original costs when such asset prices would be expected to increase. The Hope decision upheld the Federal Power Commission's use of original costs, which subsequently were widely used by federal and state regulators. While rates based on current costs have, indeed, differed in the expected way from the corresponding rates based on historical costs, this paper demonstrates that (1) the large differences expected by conventional wisdom are the result of faulty application of the current cost methodology and (2) proper application substantially narrows the difference between the rates produced by the respective approaches.","Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, Boston, MA 02110 USA",,"Tardiff, TJ (通讯作者)，Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, 211 Congress St, Boston, MA 02110 USA.",timtardiff@aacg.com,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Particularly, we explore the discrepancies in the Chinese enterprises' saving rates from the new perspectives of ownership type, monopoly status, and financial development. We find that only some financial indicators of a firm, including the size and the long-term solvency ability, have direct impact on its saving rate. Besides, the difference in the saving rates between private firms and state-owned firms is insignificant while monopolies have higher saving rates than non-monopolies. Most importantly, financial development generally reduces a firm's saving rate and the impact is independent on its ownership type and monopoly status. Moreover, financial development decreases the influence of a firm's short-term solvency and profitability on its saving rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The analyses were submitted as evidence in an equal remuneration case brought before Australia's key industrial tribunal, Fair Work Australia. We argue that mathematical methods and specialist techniques in economic analysis can deflect attention from important assumptions and ideological commitments underlying economic analyses of gendered patterns of work and pay. However, debate in the public sphere represents an opportunity to explain and discuss these methods and assumptions to better understand their social and policy implications. We conclude that there are advantages to be gained from discussing and scrutinising the assumptions of economic analysis with people who are knowledgeable about labour markets but non-specialist in terms of applying economic theory, such as union officials, union members, employer groups and representatives and industrial tribunals.

The composite error term method yields estimates of large underreporting of IMRs over time and provinces in China during the past 30 years. China does not follow the standard growth paradigm of more growth leading to lower IMRs. Fiscal decentralization has not alleviated the problem of high IMRs. Both IMRs and the sex ratio at birth suggest reported data constitute a floor or minimal level of demographic distress across provinces with millions of missing females not fully included in the data. China's one-child policy leads to not only underreporting by families but also reporting abuse by local officials who want to be promoted.

Our model includes position auctions, single-minded combinatorial auctions, and constrained matching markets. When the agents' values are drawn independently from a distribution, the Bayesian optimal mechanism is given by Myerson [1] as a virtual-surplus optimizer. We develop a framework for prior-free mechanism design and analysis. A good mechanism in our framework approximates the optimal mechanism for the distribution if there is a distribution; moreover, when there is no distribution this mechanism still provably performs well. We define and characterize optimal envy-free outcomes in symmetric single-dimensional environments. Our characterization mirrors Myerson's theory. Furthermore, unlike in mechanism design where there is no point-wise optimal mechanism, there is always a point-wise optimal envy-free outcome. Envy-free outcomes and incentive-compatible mechanisms are similar in structure and performance. We therefore use the optimal envy-free revenue as a benchmark for measuring the performance of a prior-free mechanism. A good mechanism is one that approximates the envy-free benchmark on any profile of agent values. We show that good mechanisms exist, and in particular, a natural generalization of the random sampling auction of Goldberg et al. [2] is a constant approximation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The computational advantages of ABLP include (i) the linear approximation enables us to adopt an analytic inversion of the market share equations instead of a numerical inversion that BLP propose, (ii) ABLP solves the market share equations only at the optimum, and (iii) it minimizes over a typically small dimensional parameter space. We show that the ABLP estimator is equivalent to the BLP estimator in large data sets.

First, it is a financial and economic crisis, inducing hugely negative effects on growth, distribution, and welfare. Second, it severely damaged the mainstream in economics, particularly the theory of efficient financial markets and the theory of self-regulating markets. Third, it caused an ongoing fragility of conventional public policies to,address socioeconomic issues. The scale of the global crisis demands nothing less than paradigm change. This change requires adopting an interdisciplinary triangle, in which economics dialogues productively with political science and international relations. The goal is a more pluralist and interdisciplinary theory of economic policies. In that spirit, the paper provides a critical analysis of the dominant narrative on globalization, and outlines an alternative, one that could favor more democratic and progressive policies, at both the national and international level.","Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4003 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Silva, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4003 Oporto, Portugal.",asilva@fep.up.pt,,"Santos Silva, Augusto/0000-0002-2270-0185",,,,,28,1,1,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The empirical results show that there is an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between industrialization and CO2 emissions in the three regions in China. Urbanization follows an inverted U-shaped pattern with CO2 emissions in the eastern region, and a positive U-shaped pattern in the central region. However, the nonlinear impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions is insignificant in the western region. As a result the differential dynamic effects of industrialization and urbanization on CO2 emissions in the three regions should be taken into consideration in reducing China's CO2 emissions.

First, we study whether idiosyncratic volatility at the bank level can impact aggregate volatility.

Second, a higher share of domestic credit to GDP coincides with higher volatility in the short run.

At such a Skiba point the decision maker is indifferent between choosing trajectories that approach different steady states. This paper extends this theory towards free end-time optimal control problems, where the decision maker collects a salvage value at the endogenous horizon date. In particular, besides operating forever, the decision maker can choose to stop operations immediately, or to operate during a finite time interval after which the decision maker stops and collects a salvage value. This paper illustrates the new theory with a firm-level capital accumulation problem in which the manager has the option to sell the firm (be acquired) at any time. This situation may be relevant for certain high-tech start-ups that create intellectual property which may be of value to an acquiring firm and which is hard for an outside firm to tap in other ways (e.g., via licensing).

Depending on whether they affect regulation, competition or contracts, market imperfections driving CSR decisions are classified in three categories: public goods and bads and altruism; imperfect competition; and incomplete contracts. We successively present these drivers of CSR decisions and highlight the nature of incentives (external or internal) at work and the testable (and tested) hypotheses in the reviewed studies. We finally review the link between CSR and financial performance, as well as between CSR and social and environmental performance. A twofold discrepancy appears in the literature, opening future research paths: a disconnection between our understanding of CSR drivers and CSR impacts; and a knowledge gap between CSR financial and social consequences, the latter having received little attention.","[Crifo, Patricia] Univ Paris West Nanterre, Nanterre, France; [Crifo, Patricia; Forget, Vanina D.] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Forget, Vanina D.] AgroParisTech Engref, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; AgroParisTech,"Crifo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris West Nanterre, Nanterre, France.",,,,,,,,116,106,121,2,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In PPP, the building of public infrastructure and the provision of related services are procured through only one contract. On the one hand, such bundling of tasks provides incentives to invest in the infrastructure to minimize the cost of providing public services over the long term. On the other hand, it creates incentives for the government to behave opportunistically, by not respecting the terms of the long-term contractual agreement. Contrarily, in the traditional procurement (TP), the public service provision tasks are contracted out separately. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we show that government commitment not to engage in opportunistic behavior is the key factor determining the cost efficiency of PPP. Second, we specify the economic determinants of government's choice between PPP and TP under government opportunism.","European Univ Inst, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy",European University Institute,"Valero, V (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Via Fontanelle 10, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",vanessa.valero@eui.eu,,,,,,,17,18,21,6,66,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Interestingly, however, in the period after the crisis, we detected unidirectional causality in mean from real economic growth to stock returns and unidirectional causality in variance from stock returns to real economic growth. These new findings imply that the linkage between China's stock market and its real economy has become stronger in the post-crisis period.

In particular, the formalisation level of the structures as a subject of path-dependent developments is observed. Quantitative and qualitative research methods are combined for the empirical evidence and data from three different sources are employed: the European Social Survey, the survey of Estonian managers and interviews with managers from Estonian software companies. The authors show that the communist past still affects organisational life today. The path this past created affects the organisational structures in the present in two ways: first, a kind of structural inertia can be observed, where the Soviet style of management with its high formalisation is still present today and limits employees' freedom to deal with their work. Second, an opposite trend can be revealed for the other actors in the same game, the managers, as another kind of path dependency exists - a process where the past has caused a powerful response, forcing the actors to react against the Soviet management style. We demonstrate that this path dependency can be perceived differently by different actors in an organisation and we show that the path dependency is a complex issue with many nuances within it.","[Sakowski, K.; Vadi, M.; Merikuell, J.] Univ Tartu, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia; [Merikuell, J.] Bank Estonia, Tallinn, Estonia",University of Tartu; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Sakowski, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Ulikooli 18, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia.",Karin.Sakowski@ut.ee,,"Merikull, Jaanika/0000-0002-5699-8602",,,,,34,10,10,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2015,27.0,1,,,,,76,90,,10.1080/14631377.2015.992229,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CA6OK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349034200005,0

A key question for the US outlook is therefore whether household deleveraging has ended or whether further adjustment is needed. The novelty of this paper is to estimate a time-varying equilibrium household debt-to-income ratio determined by economic fundamentals to examine this question. The paper uses state-level data for household debt from the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel over the period 1999Q1-2012Q4 and employs the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999), adjusted for cross-section dependence. The results support the view that, despite significant progress in household balance sheet repair, household deleveraging still had some way to go as of 2012Q4, as the actual debt-to-income-ratio continued to exceed its estimated equilibrium. The baseline conclusions are rather robust to a set of alternative specifications. Going forward, our model suggests that part of this debt gap could, however, be closed by improving economic conditions rather than only by further declines in actual debt. Nevertheless, the normalisation of the monetary policy stance may imply challenges for the deleveraging process by reducing the level of sustainable household debt.","[Albuquerque, Bruno; Baumann, Ursel; Krustev, Georgi] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Albuquerque, Bruno] Banco Portugal, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Banco de Portugal,"Albuquerque, B (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",bruno.albuquerque@ecb.int,"Albuquerque, Bruno/AAY-8307-2020","Albuquerque, Bruno/0000-0003-1107-5473; Krustev, Georgi/0000-0003-1514-8449",,,,,46,4,5,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The results are compared with those of a wide selection of competing models, which include a linear DSGE model and a variety of vector autoregressive (VAR) models. The parameters in the VAR models are estimated with classical and Bayesian techniques, where some of the Bayesian models are augmented with stochastic variable selection, time-varying parameters, endogenous structural breaks and various forms of prior shrinkage (where the Minnesota prior is included as a special case). The structure of the DSGE models follow that of New Keynesian varieties, which allow for nominal and real rigidities. The nonlinear DSGE model makes use of the second-order solution method of Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004), and a particle filter is used to generate values for the unobserved variables. Most of the parameters in these models are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. The models are applied to the macroeconomic data of South Africa, which is classified as an emerging market economy. The initial in-sample period of 1960Q1 to 1999Q4 is used to generate an eight-step ahead forecast. The models are then estimated recursively, by extending the in-sample period by a quarter, to generate successive forecasts over the out-of-sample period 2000Q1 to 2011Q4. We find that the forecasting performance of the nonlinear DSGE model is almost always superior to that of its linear counterpart, particularly over longer forecasting horizons. The nonlinear DSGE model also outperforms the selection of VAR models in most cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A relevant finding of our analysis is that SRFs played an 'insurance role' outperforming CFs during the 2007 global financial crisis.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Law Econ & Inst, Rome, Italy; [Ciciretti, Rocco; Dalo, Ambrogio; Herzel, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy; [Ciciretti, Rocco] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ciciretti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.",rocco.ciciretti@uniroma2.it,"Herzel, Stefano/W-2310-2019","CICIRETTI, ROCCO/0000-0001-9813-9171; Dalo, Ambrogio/0000-0002-1041-4827; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716; Herzel, Stefano/0000-0002-2984-9679",,,,,58,59,67,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using actual quarterly panel data for three EU candidate countries (Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey) in the period January 2005 - June 2010, we estimate a binomial logit model, which accurately predicts potential episodes of outbreak of currency crisis. In addition, we find that real GDP growth rate, participation in an IMF loan program, current account and fiscal balance and short-term external indebtedness are the most significant common predictors of currency crises across EU candidate countries. These results imply implementing policy measures aimed at raising the growth potential of the domestic economies of EU candidate countries, monitoring their short-term external indebtedness, improving their external competitiveness, cutting public spending and increasing the confidence of residents and non-residents in their domestic banking sectors.","Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Bucevska, V (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",,,"Bucevska, Vesna/0000-0002-4411-4953",,,,,42,5,5,0,12,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62.0,4,,,,,493,510,,10.2298/PAN1504493B,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CT3GX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362696300005,0

As the Chinese economy passed through its Lewis turning point, weakened supply-side factors caused its growth to slow. The increasing concern regarding the economic slowdown has induced both the central and local governments to implement various stimulus plans through instruments of macroeconomic, industrial and regional policies. By examining where the imbalances of the Chinese economy really lie and investigating the determinants of the current slowdown and of the enhancement of the potential growth rate, the present paper suggests that the best path of action for the Chinese Government is not to stimulate growth through demand-side factors but to increase the potential growth rate through reforms in certain key areas.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Cai, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",caifang@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,27,11,11,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2015,23.0,1,,,,,1,20,,10.1111/cwe.12097,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CA4CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348852000001,0

In our model, the rationale for government intervention is based on internalities and externalities. While a corrective tax could be imposed to address these two distortions, it may result in excessive nicotine consumption per cigarette. This suggests that tax rates should be moderated. We consider two types of behavior that affect the addictiveness of cigarettes. First, producers can manipulate the nicotine content of tobacco products. Second, consumers are able to adjust the intensity of their smoking. We show that there may still be a case for a corrective tax. However, tax policies and attainable welfare depend on whether the nicotine dose from each cigarette is influenced by producers or consumers.","[Calcott, Paul; Petkov, Vladimir P.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Petkov, VP (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",paul.calcott@vuw.ac.nz; vladimir.petkov@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In investigating the roles that perceived risk plays in consumers' online purchasing behavior, most of the studies viewed perceived risk as high-level surrogate construct, and a few focused on one or several risk facets. Few studies, however, distinguished how different sources of perceived risk influence consumers' purchase behavior. We thus seek to fill this research gap in this study. Based on value transfer process and components, we theoretically decompose online purchase perceived risk into three major source components: uncertainty of transaction cost, product performance and consumer's individual anxiety, and propose how they bring their respective impacts to consumers' purchase behavior. By introducing some other online shopping involved factors as control part, we propose a more comprehensive conceptual research model. Empirical results from a field survey in China shows that different sources of perceived risk bring distinct effects to purchase behavior. Perceived risks from individual anxiety were found to have significant influences on consumers' satisfaction and re-purchase intention, while risks from transaction cost affect only satisfaction. Moreover, risks perceived from product performance were even found to have positive impact on re-purchase intention. Our study provides insights into how different sources of perceived risk influence consumers' purchase behavior.","[Chen, Yue; Yan, Xiangbin] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Fan, Weiguo] Virginia Tech, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Harbin Institute of Technology; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, 13 FaYuan St, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",chenyue1984@gmail.com; xbyan@hit.edu.cn; wfan@vt.edu,"Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019; Fan, Weiguo/E-6343-2012","Fan, Weiguo/0000-0003-1272-5538",,,,,58,9,10,1,69,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We show that median pricing results in allocation inefficiencies as some high-cost firms potentially displace low-cost firms as winners. Further, the auction may leave demand unfulfilled as some winners refuse to supply because the price is set below their cost. We also introduce a model of nonbinding bids that establishes the rationality of a lowball bid strategy employed by many bidders in the actual Medicare auctions and recently replicated in Caltech experiments. We contrast the median-price auction with the standard clearing-price auction where each firm bids true costs as a dominant strategy, resulting in competitive equilibrium prices and full efficiency.

How might long-run occupational polarization be related to cyclical changes in middle-skill employment? We find that middle-skill jobs have traditionally been more cyclical than other jobs, in part because of the volatile industries that tend to employ middle-skill workers. Also, unemployed middle-skill workers appear to have few attractive or feasible employment alternatives outside of their skill class, and the drop in male participation rates during the past several decades can be explained in part by a drying-up of middle-skill job opportunities. Taken together, these results imply that any model relating polarization to middle-skill employment fluctuations must go beyond pure search motives to include industry-level effects as well as a labor-force participation margin. The results thus provide encouragement for a growing literature that integrates macro-labor search models with macro-macro models featuring differential industry cyclicalities and convex preferences over consumption and leisure.","[Foote, Christopher L.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA USA; [Ryan, Richard W.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Foote, CL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA USA.",Chris.Foote@bos.frb.org; RichRyan@umich.edu,,,,,,,34,19,25,0,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

J,"Gabrielsen, TS; Johansen, BO",,,,"Gabrielsen, Tommy Staahl; Johansen, Bjorn Olav",,,Buyer power and exclusion in vertically related markets,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exclusive dealing; Exclusive purchasing; Exclusive selling; Buyer power,CONTRACTS,"Suppliers and consumer organizations have become increasingly concerned by the build-up of buyer power of retailers in many markets. A major concern is that strong retailers will abuse their power to exclude products and rival retailers from the market to be able to increase prices to consumers. As a consequence, remedies to limit buyer power are discussed and implemented in many countries. In this paper we compare the incentives for exclusion, and the effect on consumers prices, under both buyer and seller power. We study a model with a dominant upstream manufacturer and a competitive fringe of producers offering their products to two differentiated downstream retailers. We compare the equilibrium outcome of this model when i) the dominant supplier holds all the bargaining power, and (ii) the retailers have all the bargaining power. We show that full or partial exclusion of either the competitive product or downstream retailers occurs when inter and intrabrand competition are strong. This is true both under seller and buyer power.

Previous studies have indicated a number of effects that PPPs need to achieve in order to ensure sustainable development. However, partnership in seaports in the Republic of Croatia is a poorly researched issue and the relevant criteria required for positive effects have not yet been defined. We have defined five groups of criteria: economic-financial, organisational, technical-technological, social criteria and criteria aimed at harmonisation with European Union policies (currently characteristic for Croatia). To determine the relevance and importance of these criteria, it was necessary to collect data by using the method of interviewing experts from different scientific areas and of diverse professional competences. Regarding the relevant stakeholders (public interest, private interest and the interest of the broader community), research analysis has provided multiple research results which have pointed out that technical-technological and organisational development are the key criteria for a successful partnership model. The results obtained in the research can be applied to future management models in Croatian seaports that will be based on PPPs.","[Hadzic, Ana Peric; Jugovic, Alen] Univ Rijeka, Fac Maritime Studies, Rijeka, Croatia; [Peric, Marko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Hadzic, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Maritime Studies, Rijeka, Croatia.",ana@pfri.hr,"Jugovic, Alen/ABC-6855-2021; Hadzic, Ana Peric/L-1171-2017; Peric, Marko/Q-6495-2018","Jugovic, Alen/0000-0001-5031-4655; Peric, Marko/0000-0002-2828-4709",,,,,20,3,3,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Every task of an organization can be imagined as a project, being a coordinated set of activities toward a common goal. One important aspect of PM is analysing the information related to the optimum balance among the project's objectives. Each project is a combination of different activities, being connected to each other and having several success criteria, among which the time, cost and quality of the project completion are more significant, due to their significant effect on obtained results. Accordingly, the time might lead to delay and penalty which means more cost; and cost may be underestimated than real required funds. They both will lead to failure in project management. On the other hand, quality is the final key which confirms the success. The aim of a time-cost-quality trade-off problem (TCQTP) is to select a set of activities and an appropriate execution mode for each activity; the cost and time of the project is minimized while the project quality is maximized. The purpose of this paper is to present a model for TCQTP in which these parameters are approximated by grey numbers. Since there are various modes to accomplish each activity, the trade-off problem is formulated based upon a multiobjective integer grey programming model. Afterwards, a goal programming-based approach is designed to solve this model. The model's results provide a framework for the project manager to manage his/her project successfully, in acceptable time, with the lowest cost and the highest quality. The main originality of the proposed model is the approximation of time, cost and quality parameters of activities mode with grey numbers and the development of a two phase goal programming-based approach to solve this problem. Ultimately, the proposed model is applied in two different cases and results are illustrated to clarify the outstanding capabilities of the model.","[Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi] Khatam Inst Higher Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Akrami, Hadi] EN Bank, Tehran 1968655944, Iran; [Hashemi, Shide Sadat; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Management, Kashan Branch, Kashan, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Hajiagha, SHR (通讯作者)，Khatam Inst Higher Educ, 30 Hakim Azam Ave,North Shiraz Ave,Mollasadra St, Tehran, Iran.",s.hossein.r@gmail.com; h.akrami@gmail.com; shide_hashemi@yahoo.com; h.amoozad@ut.ac.ir,"Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020","Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603",,,,,31,20,24,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This transformation profoundly affects the evolution of ICT products and services and the ways intellectual capital assets are used and organised as well as how knowledge work in diverse teams, different organisations and sourcing networks is conducted. The acquisition, creation and sharing of collective intelligence through social networks and knowledge communities are crucial factors for success and will be investigated through the study of distributed teams involved in software development (SD). The objectives of the DD-SCALE programme presented in this paper are to acquire knowledge about the competencies and tools of SD companies in assessing knowledge work operations, especially when they use comprehensive evaluation systems, create new work practices and manage dynamic distributed sourcing network operations in global value constellations. Concerning the practical outcomes the study aims to create a new scalable framework for evaluating the efficiency and performance of SD work taking place on multisite settings-this will lay the groundwork for the DD-SCALE. Secondly, the experience and knowledge gained by using of performance measurement tools and new work practices should allow the development of managerial methods and practices for use by those company representatives responsible for maintaining a company's expert skills and competencies. Thirdly, the work expertise practices that are implemented in collaboration with participating companies will provide guidance to international knowledge work settings and help to analyse offshoring, nearshoring and onshoring decisions in global value networks. Case evidence from the challenges the four leading Finnish SD companies face will be introduced. The selected case companies are leaders in their industry and possess high-performing software teams that are focused on scaling up their operational excellence and innovation performance in new distributed settings in order to sustain competitive advantage. DD-SCALE is a co-creation research programme that has funding from 2014 to 2016 to concentrate on company-specific development projects. The programme combines the knowledge and ability of three academic institutes, four SD companies and the leading Finnish technology and innovation funding agency, Tekes, in the desire to improve their performance in global SD work. The programme will also assist in formatting industrial policy settings to improve the Finnish ICT sector's understanding of SD's changing sourcing environment, detect their competencies in executing this work in different work settings and enable dynamic sourcing through multiple sites.","[Kamaja, Pekka] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Ruohonen, Mikko; Ingalsuo, Timo] Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, CIRCMI, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences; Tampere University,"Kamaja, P (通讯作者)，Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.kamaja@haaga-helia.fi,,,,,,,39,2,3,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,173,180,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600021,0

We examine the hours worked by auditors in completing 2322 audits in Korea between 2006 and 2010. Audit efficiency can be determined by the total audit effort required to achieve a successful audit. Using a sample consisting of firms maintaining a certain level of audit quality, we investigate whether financial statement comparability reduces audit hours. We find that comparability is negatively associated with audit hours. In addition, we find that the effect of comparability on audit hours is attenuated for firms that are 'highly followed' by financial analysts. This study contributes to the literature by proposing a possible way to improve audit efficiency from a unique perspective. While prior studies show that a client's inherent risk and control risk lower audit efficiency, the results of this study show that comparability between financial statements facilitates audit efficiency. Improvements in audit efficiency reduce the opportunity costs associated with audit effort and thereby enable auditors to spend more time and effort focusing on high-risk engagements. Comparability is one of four qualitative characteristics of accounting information included in accounting conceptual frameworks. Despite the importance of comparability, there is very little research on its benefits. This study makes a unique contribution by measuring audit effort using a large database of audit hours worked by auditors in Korean firms.","[Kang, Minjung] Daejeon Univ, Coll Business Adm, Taejon, South Korea; [Kim, Jin Wook] Konkuk Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Ho-Young] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Myung-Gun] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Business, Gyeongsangbuk Do, South Korea",Daejeon University; Konkuk University; Yonsei University; Yeungnam University,"Lee, HY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",hylee@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jin Wook/0000-0002-6397-6620",,,,,41,9,10,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper analyzes the power of incentives offered to takaful operators in mitigating problems associated with such a relationship. These incentives include wakalah, an upfront agency fee as a percentage of premiums; mudarabah, a share in investment income from technical reserves; and surplus-sharing (a share in the insurance surplus). The paper concludes that all incentives offered to takaful operators must include surplus-sharing and that offering mudarabah in the presence of surplus-sharing is optimal only when the risk-adjusted return on investing technical reserves outweighs a similar return on effort exerted in underwriting risks. A wakalah hybrid is also recommended as it induces the operator to increase the size of the pool that, in turn, reduces average risk to the benefit of policyholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Not only is there a growing number of papers written in co-authorship, but also there is an increase in the number of co-authors. In this paper, we investigate whether similar tendencies have emerged in the scientific community of economists in Poland. Using social network analysis, we focus on collaboration between researchers publishing in five leading Polish economic journals. We find that the number of articles written in collaboration is steadily increasing. We also document a rise in the average number of authors per article.

The full form of the hypothesis implies the increase in the risk undertakings and profitability of banks that exceed a certain dimension; the partial form of the hypothesis implies only an augmented risk appetite of large banks compared to their smaller counterparts. The examined area is the European banking industry, whose behaviour is observed over the first wave of the present financial crisis (2007/09). The estimation of a quadratic fit that links change in a bank's credit risk profile and profitability retention rates with a bank's size suggests the existence of a partial form of the TBTF hypothesis. However, a more precise, local rolling windows estimation of the size sensitivities reveals that large banks - those whose liabilities exceed approximately 2% of the country of origin's GDP (15% of our sample) - show an increase in credit risk profile and a superior capability of retaining higher ROA scores, vis-a-vis their smaller counterparts. With the caveats of our investigation, we interpret these results as evidence of a full form of the TBTF hypothesis.","[Mattana, Paolo; Petroni, Filippo; Rossi, Stefania Patrizia Sonia] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Mattana, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",mattana@unica.it,"Petroni, Filippo/AAM-5876-2020; Petroni, Filippo/K-3366-2012","Petroni, Filippo/0000-0001-8467-8481; ROSSI, STEFANIA PATRIZIA SONIA/0000-0001-8164-0170",,,,,32,9,10,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Daily returns of Croatian (CROBEX), Czech (PX50), Hungarian (BUX) and Romanian (BET) stock exchange indices are analysed for the period January, 2000 - February, 2012, while daily returns of the Serbian (BELEX15) index is examined for the period September, 2005 - February, 2012. In recent years there has been much research conducted into VaR in developed markets, while papers dealing with VaR calculation in CEE are rare. Furthermore, VaR models created and suited for liquid and well-developed markets that assume normal distribution are less reliable for capital markets in emerging economies, such as Central and Eastern European Union member and candidate states. Since capital markets in European emerging economies are highly volatile, less liquid and strongly dependent on the unexpected external shocks, market risk estimation based on normality assumption in CEE countries is more problematic. This motivates us to implement GARCH-type methods that involve time varying volatility and heavy tails of the empirical distribution of returns. We test the hypothesis that using the assumption of heavy tailed distribution it is possible to forecast market risk more precisely, especially in times of crisis, than under the assumption of normal distribution or using historical simulations method. Our backtesting results for the last 500 observations are based on the Kupiec POF and Christoffersen independence test. They show that GARCH-type models with t error distribution in most analysed cases give better VaR estimation than GARCH type models with normal errors in the case of a 99% confidence level, while in the case of a 95% confidence level it is the opposite. The results of backtesting analysis for the crisis period (after the collapse of Lehman Brothers) show that GARCH-type models with t-distribution of residuals provide better VaR estimates compared with GARCH-type models with normal distribution, historical simulations and RiskMetrics methods. The RiskMetrics method in the most cases underestimates market risk.","[Miletic, Mirjana] Natl bank Serbia, Directorate Econ Res & Stat, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Miletic, Sinisa] Coll Business Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",,"Miletic, M (通讯作者)，Natl bank Serbia, Directorate Econ Res & Stat, Kralja Petra 12, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",mirjana.palic@nbs.rs,,,,,,,35,18,18,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

While marginal and participation tax rates (PTRs) in the majority of analysed cases fall as a result of the introduced reforms, the conclusions from looking at replacement rates (RRs) for the population eligible for means tested benefits are generally different. These suggest that despite significant tax giveaways incentives on the labour market weakened for families with children and for those eligible to safety net benefits. Yet despite these negative policy implications, we show that work incentives improved substantially over the period due to significant real wage growth. When analysing the effect of the reforms on financial incentives to work, we often find conflicting conclusions when using the PTRs and RRs to reflect financial attractiveness of employment. This is not necessarily surprising, but serves as a note of caution on the use of each of them independently.","[Myck, Michal; Domitrza, Adrian; Morawski, Leszek; Semeniuk, Aneta] CenEA, Ctr Econ Anal, PL-70486 Szczecin, Poland; [Morawski, Leszek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Myck, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Anal Szczecin, Ul Krolowej Korony Polskiej 25, PL-70486 Szczecin, Poland.",michalmyck@gmail.com,"Morawski, Leszek/ABA-3220-2020; Myck, Michal/ABA-7136-2021","Morawski, Leszek/0000-0003-3464-3963; Myck, Michal/0000-0002-9894-838X",Polish National Science Centre [6752/B/H03/2011/40],Polish National Science Centre,This work was supported by the Polish National Science Centre [6752/B/H03/2011/40].,,29,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Equilibrium prices are high, because consumers understand that visiting a store exposes them to a hold-up problem. However, a firm with more products charges lower prices, because it attracts consumers who are more price sensitive. Similarly, when a firm advertises a low price on one product, consumers rationally expect it to charge somewhat lower prices on its other products as well. We therefore find that having a large product range, and advertising a low price on one product, are substitute ways of building a low-price image. Finally, we show that in a competitive setting each product has a high regular price, with firms occasionally giving random discounts that are positively correlated across products.","Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Rhodes, A (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council (UK); British Academy,Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); British Academy,"I would like to thank Marco Ottaviani and three referees for their many helpful comments, which have significantly improved the article.

By focusing on the structural changes to its ownership, a central element in China's economic transformation under market reform, the present paper highlights the importance of private entrepreneurship in deepening market reform and, thereby, in driving economic growth in a more efficient and sustainable way. Based on a perspective of resource allocation and a conceptual framework of entrepreneurship, the paper elaborates on the evolution of the private sector and its performance in the context of ownership reform, making comparisons with the performance of the state sector. The analysis suggests that there is further room for more productive use of economic resources, especially capital, land and natural resources, by increasing the participation of private entrepreneurs in industries with high entry barriers in favor of state-owned enterprises. Moreover, more competitive and equal access to productive resources through reform is needed to promote more productive entrepreneurship and to reduce rent-seeking activities.","[Son Ngoc Chu; Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",son.chu@anu.edu.au; ligang.song@anu.edu.au,,"Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,69,14,15,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2015,23.0,1,,,,,47,77,,10.1111/cwe.12099,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CA4CN,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348852000003,0

In this paper, we investigate the spatial layout of employment changes in knowledge-intensive services in areas which production is based on high-technologies in countries of EU at NUTS 2 level in years of 2005 - 2011. Spatial autocorrelation measures the correlation of a variable with itself through space. For comparison of the share of employment in knowledge and technology intensive sectors was used the known degree of spatial autocorrelation Moran's coefficient which significance is determined by using Monte Carlo methods. In the article we identify areas within the EU with a high share of employment in activities which production is based on high, respectively knowledge-intensive services. Detection of technology and knowledge intensity of economy in comparison with the states on the basis of employment in technologically intensive sector provides an objective view on given economy, because the results are not affected by price differences nor exchange differentiates because all states do not use Euro. Employment in technologically intensive sector of economy presents only certain assumption in order to achieve a higher effect. Important is, whether it is successful to produce a higher share of added value in technologically intensive sectors. In this paper we therefore examine the spatial layout of added value at NUTS 2 level. In conclusion, using fuzzy c - cluster analysis, we create clusters of similar regions from two basic aspects of the index for 2011 - the share of employment in activities producing with high-tech, respectively knowledge-intensive services (2005 = 100) and base index for 2011 of the added value of the region in PPS (2005 = 100). We describe possible reasons of participation of individual areas in formed clusters. For calculations we used data from the Eurostat database, the ILO and GeoDa program.","[Spirkova, Daniela] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Stehlikova, Beata] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Pan-European University,"Spirkova, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",daniela.spirkova@stuba.sk; stehlikovab@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,305,313,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600036,0

The Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) have undergone remarkable economic transition since 1990 in spite of their different initial conditions, and have become members of the European Union in 2004. The economic reforms that were in line with the Business model of transition, supported by the international institutions, and privatization attracted the massive inflow of foreign direct investment and know-how to these countries, helped to create the substantial SME sector, and increased the competitiveness of these countries in the international scale. In spite of the progress attained, the rapidly developing globalization and transformation to the knowledge based economy, opens new challenges for Visegrad countries. In near future they will have to substantially augment support for R&D, innovation, education, business cluster formation and transborder co-operation in order to stay competitive and help to fulfill the Lisbon strategy expectations in the European Union. In strategic terms, the social and intellectual capital can be understood not only as one of the most important factors in the success of entrepreneurial subjects but also as an important source of competitive advantages. Qualitative and quantitative dimensions of knowledge assets also affect the overall competitiveness of the enterprise. V4 countries are trying to increase their innovation performance in recent years. One of the tools used to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the clusters creation can be considered as forms of partnerships that create an environment suitable for innovation and knowledge creation. Due to this fact, the regions with strong clusters are regarded as innovative leaders and have a positive impact on the economic performance of businesses (Solvell 2009) and thus on their better competitiveness. As competitiveness has moved to a global level, the need for assessment has risen. The level of V4 countries competitiveness is evaluated in the present article by index of global competitiveness GCI (The Global Competitiveness Index).","[Spirkova, Daniela] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Caganova, Dagmar; Bawa, Manan] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Fac Mat Sci & Technol Trnava, Inst Ind Engn & Management, Trnava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,"Spirkova, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",daniela.spirkova@stuba.sk; dagmar.caganova@stuba.sk; manan.bawa@stuba.sk,"Caganova, Dagmar/D-2946-2017","Caganova, Dagmar/0000-0002-6834-6126",,,,,30,12,12,0,22,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,314,323,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600037,0

Tourism is one of the most important parts of the Croatian economy. It is particularly important in the context of the services sector. Regular and significant surpluses and the consumption of foreign guests are an important element of budget revenues, especially VAT. The ability to forecast the development of inbound tourism demand in a timely manner is crucial for both business decisions and policy-making. We combine the Granger causality test for identifying leading indicators with a grid search of the weights used to construct a composite indicator. An endogenous grid search for data driven weights was employed to minimise the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the out-of-sample forecast. In total, we carried out 7.7 billion out-of-sample regressions in order to find the optimal combination of leading indicator weights. Results indicate that only four out of the 12 identified leading indicators are relevant in explaining variations in inbound tourism demand. The most important leading indicators are: real GDP and imports in Poland and gross wages in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.","[Tica, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Kozic, Ivan] Inst Tourism, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute for Tourism - Croatia,"Tica, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",jtica@efzg.hr,"Kozic, Ivan/HNS-8655-2023; Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573",,,,,24,9,9,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The logistic regression analysis shows that education and the availability of local enterprises or trade villages, notably among other factors, have a significantly increasing impact on the likelihood of taking up wage employment, while the presence of paved roads gives households more chance to engage in nonfarm self-employment. Using a propensity score matching analysis, the study found that households that participated in wage or nonfarm self-employment have higher levels of per capita income than those without nonfarm employment. The findings imply that nonfarm employment offers a pathway out of poverty for ethnic minorities.","Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Polit Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam",Vietnam National University Hanoi,"Tran, TQ (通讯作者)，Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Polit Econ, Room 100,Bldg E4,144 Xuan Thuy St, Hanoi, Vietnam.",tuyentq@vnu.edu.vn,,"Tran, Tuyen/0000-0002-0221-1480",Vietnam National University; VNU University of Economics and Business,Vietnam National University; VNU University of Economics and Business,The author thanks Vietnam National University and VNU University of Economics and Business for funding the publication of this research.

To that end, this paper employs both cointegration analysis and a Granger causality test. This paper finds that inflation has a greater effect on labour productivity than do real wages. Furthermore, the Granger causality test shows that there is a strong feedback between labour productivity and inflation, suggesting policy makers targeting inflation should follow labour productivity. This test suggests that there is no causal link running from productivity to real wages in the Turkish manufacturing industry. This absence of a link is largely due to lower bargaining power and structural problems, including high unemployment, a huge tax burden on wages and the large share of the informal sector.","Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-26470 Eskisehir, Turkey",Anadolu University,"Yildirim, Z (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, TR-26470 Eskisehir, Turkey.",zekeriyayildirim@anadolu.edu.tr,"Yildirim, Zekeriya/H-8657-2016","Yildirim, Zekeriya/0000-0002-0324-4356",,,,,43,19,20,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

China's current account surplus will diminish as a result of the decline in the goods trade surplus, the expanding service trade deficit and negative investment income. China's capital account might shift from surplus to deficit as a result of shrinking net direct investment inflows and more volatile short-term capital flows. When the twin surpluses no longer exist, the normalization of the US treasury bond yields will be sped up, terminating the one-way appreciation of the RMB exchange rate; the People's Bank of China's pressure to sterilize inflows will be alleviated, and new problems for the People's Bank of China's monetary operation will emerge; new financial vulnerabilities for the Chinese economy will arise.

This differs from the traditional supply chain coordination model. Firstly, demand is simultaneously affected by retail price and nonprice marketing effort from manufacturers and retailers. Secondly, when the demand is disrupted, this article considers disruptions in the market scale and price sensitivity coefficient. Thirdly, the supply chain coordination model is proposed via effort and revenue sharing contract. In this way, the manufacturer reduces the wholesale price as an incentive for the retailer to share revenue. Finally, the total supply chain profit is greater with contract than no contract.

Based on this observation, I argue that the recent growth of world trade is best understood from a factor-proportions perspective. Using data on trade barriers and estimates of capital-labour ratios for a group of 45 economies between 1980 and 2008, I find that a calibrated factor-proportions model can generate significant trade growth during this period, amounting to 90% of the observed rise in North-South trade. The opening up of China alone accounts for three quarters of the predicted increase. In line with the model, I present evidence that China's liberalisation has raised the exports and imports of capital-abundant countries relative to more labour-abundant economies. Overall, my findings suggest that factor-proportions theory may be useful for interpreting several quantitative and qualitative aspects of growing world trade in a period during which the group of large, open economies has become significantly less homogenous.

But few studies explicitly address such costs and their impacts on trading behavior. In this article we fill this gap, using a tool from the international trade literature called the gravity equation. We first develop a theoretical model to assess the micro-foundation of this approach in a water market context. The model distinguishes between variable and fixed costs of trade, which allows us to disentangle the decision to enter into the water market (extensive margin) and the decision on the quantity of water to be transferred (intensive margin). We then test the theoretical predictions using water transfer data among California water districts over a 17-year period. We approximate transfer costs by distance and institutional factors. Results validate the theoretical predictions and show the importance of distance and institutional impediments in the decision to trade.","[Regnacq, Charles] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, F-64010 Pau, France; [Dinar, Ariel] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hanak, Ellen] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Regnacq, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, F-64010 Pau, France.",Charles.regnacq@univ-pau.fr,,,,,,,83,17,21,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Still little is known about how individuals assimilate and respond to outcome uncertainty, particularly in terms of how it affects their stated valuations. In this paper, we focus on the impact of individual risk preferences on willingness to pay for conservation of threatened species. Risk preferences are elicited through a standard incentivised multiple price list and preferences for the conservation of the two main lynx populations in Poland through a discrete choice experiment. To account for the uncertainty associated with imprecise scientific knowledge about environmental outcome, attributes in the choice experiment are presented as conservation status in terms of descriptive, non-numerical categories. The results from the multiple price list and the choice experiment are jointly analysed in a latent variable model by assuming that the responses to both are driven by the same preferences. We find that the latent risk preferences are linked to choices of the status quo option, which is the riskiest option in terms of the survival of the endangered lynx populations.","[Bartczak, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [Mariel, Petr] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain; [Chilton, Susan] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE4 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Meyerhoff, Juergen] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape & Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Warsaw; University of Basque Country; Newcastle University - UK; Technical University of Berlin,"Bartczak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",bartczak@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Mariel, Petr/K-8399-2014; Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/AAZ-9274-2020; Bartczak, Anna/AAN-1875-2021","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/0000-0001-5917-5989; Bartczak, Anna/0000-0001-5917-5989",EEA Financial Mechanism [PL0257]; Norwegian Financial Mechanism; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education,"EEA Financial Mechanism; Norwegian Financial Mechanism; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","This study was carried out as a part of the POLFOREX project ('Forest as a public good.

Keeping abreast of emerging technologies and innovations that can affect each key farm enterprise, and knowing how best to marshal the resources required for profitable farm production, are key tasks of farm management. This study draws on a longitudinal data set of 240 broadacre farmers to compare and analyse their farm performance over a decade. Using structural equation modelling, we examine relationships between the farm family's involvement in training, their human capital, their use of various innovations and ultimately the linkages of these factors to farm financial and productivity performance. Several statistically significant inter-relationships are found, and some factors are shown to have significant positive links to farm performance. We find that training undertaken by the farm family, the farm family's human capital and their use of innovations, particularly key cropping innovations, have significant beneficial impacts on farm performance. The farmer's skills in time and organisational management, their engagement in business planning and the unique environmental characteristics of the farm also significantly and positively influence farm performance.","[Xayavong, Vilaphonh] Dept Agr & Food, 3 Baron Hay Crt, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Kingwell, Ross] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Islam, Nazrul] Private Econ Consultant, 39 Sholto Crescent, Canning Vale, WA 6155, Australia",Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Xayavong, V (通讯作者)，Dept Agr & Food, 3 Baron Hay Crt, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia.",vila.xayavong@agric.wa.gov.au,"kingwell, ross/AAK-2952-2021; Kingwell, Ross/AAU-9315-2020; Islam, Nazrul/AAO-9069-2020","Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488; Islam, Nazrul/0000-0002-9276-8388",,,,,50,16,17,2,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

One of the main reasons why consumers make repeat food purchases is the food's taste. Therefore, we examined the importance of including taste testing in nonhypothetical experimental auctions. Specifically, we used two experiments to determine consumers' willingness to pay for soft drinks labeled with different calorie and sweetener information. In Experiment 1, participants tasted the soft drinks prior to the bidding rounds. In Experiment 2, participants did not taste the soft drinks prior to the bidding rounds. Bidding behavior for the soft drinks was significantly different between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Results suggest that including taste testing in the design of experimental auctions is important to accurately capture consumers' willingness to pay for foods that are purchased repeatedly.

We find that an increase in corn price has a statistically significant positive impact on corn yield, but the effect of soybean price on soybean yields is not statistically significant. The estimated price elasticities of corn yield and acreage are 0.23 and 0.45, respectively. Of the increase in corn supply caused by an increase in corn price, we find that 33.8% is due to price-induced yield enhancement and 66.2% is due to price-induced acreage expansion. We also find that the impact of climate change on corn production ranges from depending on the climate change scenarios, time horizon, and global climate models used to predict climate change.

The paper aims to find out which of these has had a greater impact on the viticulture profitability in the Czech Republic over the last twenty years. One of the frequently debated questions is whether a higher yield of grapes may also bring a high or moderately above average sugar content, and also whether the production for sale is profitable. The answer can be achieved either via the micro-appraisal (repeatable and many times conducted experiments) or via the macro-appraisal - collecting average data for the appraised region. For this paper, the macro-appraisal was chosen, i.e. the statistical survey for the Czech Republic between 1995 and 2014. The period of 20 years comes from an annual examination conducted by the Association of Wine-makers of the Czech Republic on the grapes yields in their members. In the Czech Republic, the price in the grapes market is set depending on the variety of vine and sugar content. It follows from the 20-year statistics of the Association of Wine-makers CR, that the profitability of grapes production for sale is not achieved by the sugar content but by the per hectare yield. The yield per hectare should vary between 5.5 and 7 t/ha (tonne per hectare) at the average sugar content of 18.5 to 21 degrees NM (between 11.0 and 12.5% volume of the potential alcohol). The grapes yield of more than 6 t/ha does not increase the profitability because the price offered by the purchasing companies decreases.","[Tomsik, Pavel; Stojanova, Hana; Vajcnerova, Ida] Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sedlo, Jiri] Assoc Winemakers Czech Republic, Velke Bilovice, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Tomsik, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",tomsik@mendelu.cz,"Rasovska, Ida/O-4114-2016; Stojanova, Hana/F-9640-2013","Rasovska, Ida/0000-0003-4625-3698; Stojanova, Hana/0000-0001-6375-7885",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [15-21179S],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant GACR No. 15-21179S).,,32,7,8,0,15,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Moreover, the determinants of revealed comparative advantages are scarcely investigated. This article analyses revealed comparative advantages in European ham trade from 1999 to 2013 and identifies its determinants by using the panel data econometrics. The results suggest that quality linked to the production area highly affects the competitiveness of the European ham trade. Also, the EU accession is positively correlated with the competitiveness, meaning that the economic integration fosters competitiveness. However, in spite of the initial expectations, the FDI is negatively related to the competitiveness of the European ham trade, underlining the importance of the national ham processing companies.","[Torok, Aron; Jambor, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Torok, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",aron.torok@uni-corvinus.hu,"Torok, Aron/AAO-7820-2020","Torok, Aron/0000-0001-6769-7103; Jambor, Attila/0000-0001-8089-7222",,,,,23,29,30,2,31,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We use Ipsos-Reid's Consumer Panel of Canada weekly household data across Canada over a one-year period. We find that the effect of demographic and location variables on discount usage is discount-type specific. For many pork products, the price elasticity of demand is higher for users of discounts than for nonusers. The results also indicate variation across discount types in the ability to price discriminate for specific pork products. For example, coupons and price cuts are more effective price discrimination tools than store membership discounts for processed pork products. These results suggest that retailers should be strategic with the types of discounts used to most effectively price discriminate across a variety of pork products.","[Vyn, Richard J.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada; [Hailu, Getu] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Vyn, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Ridgetown Campus,120 Main St E, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada.",rvyn@uoguelph.ca; ghailu@uoguelph.ca,,"Hailu, Getu/0000-0003-1257-5939",,,,,47,1,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The farm bill secured substantial bipartisan majorities in a politically contentious Congress. Planned outlays are predominately for nutrition assistance programs directed toward a traditional nonfarm constituency in the farm bill coalition, while annual fixed direct payments to farmers are eliminated but replaced with enhanced downside risk protection against low prices or revenue. The new support programs may prove more or less costly than the foregone fixed payments, with farmers offered a choice between a price countercyclical program with increased reference prices and a revised moving-average revenue guarantee program. The role of insurance is enhanced, notably by replacing past support programs with a new upland cotton revenue insurance program and dairy milk-to-feed margin protection program. Open policy issues that are highlighted include the costs and distortionary effects of moving-average revenue benchmarks versus fixed reference prices, the overall level of insurance premium subsidies, the potential for overlap between commodity and insurance programs, and lastly, food, environmental, and biofuels concerns that reflect the diverse portfolio of products demanded from agriculture. In an international context, we conclude that the 2014 farm safety net likely would not have been enacted had multilateral agreement been reached on the 2008 Doha Round World Trade Organization negotiating documents. Conversely, the 2014 farm bill makes achieving those limits more difficult. Research is discussed that can elucidate the ongoing political economy of U.S. farm policy and help shape future program design.","[Orden, David] Virginia Tech, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Orden, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Zulauf, Carl] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Orden, D (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",d.orden@cgiar.org,,,,,,,23,28,38,0,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Appropriate management of livestock diversity could help reinvigorate production, contribute to food security and improve farmers' livelihoods, particularly in subsistence-oriented systems. We assess differences in farmers' preferences and economic values for pig traits across different production systems and across areas that have been affected and unaffected by classical swine fever (CSF). Not surprisingly, market-oriented farmers derived higher values from the productive traits such as heavy slaughter weight and large litter size found in exotic pig genotypes. Subsistence-oriented farmers, particularly in swine fever affected areas, placed high value on tolerance to disease. We found that CSF changed farmers' preferences for adaptive traits, and less so for productive traits. Therefore, indigenous breeds become more valuable for subsistence farmers and crossbreeds for market-oriented farmers if CSF is a risk. Our results can have implications for breeding and conservation strategies and for compensation strategies after culling, and will become increasingly relevant if, as predicted, heat waves and disease outbreaks become more frequent in pig production systems in South Africa with climate change.","[Zander, Kerstin K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Madzimure, James] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Anim Prod & Technol, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Chimonyo, Michael] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Anim & Poultry Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Dzama, Kennedy] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Anim Sci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Garnett, Stephen T.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia",Charles Darwin University; University of Kwazulu Natal; Stellenbosch University; Charles Darwin University,"Zander, KK (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, Northern Inst, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",kerstin.zander@cdu.edu.au,"Chimonyo, Michael/AAE-4217-2019; Garnett, Stephen T/M-3877-2013; Zander, Kerstin/M-2888-2013","Chimonyo, Michael/0000-0002-3206-3191; Madzimure, James/0000-0002-7334-7991; Zander, Kerstin/0000-0002-2237-1801",Govan Mbeki Research and Development Centre at the University of Fort Hare,Govan Mbeki Research and Development Centre at the University of Fort Hare,"Kerstin Zander is with the Northern Institute at Charles Darwin University, Darwin, NT0909, Australia.

We examine how and to what extent this reform affected the productivity and welfare of grain farmers in China at the regional level. We find that the price regulations that destroyed the incentive to exert more effort adversely affected the growth in agricultural productivity but contributed to the growth in farmers' welfare. Although the price regulations resulted in short-term improvement in welfare across all the regions, in the long run such regulations can potentially result in larger drop in agricultural production because of its negative impact on the incentives to produce more.","Univ Westminster, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Westminster,"Selim, S (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",selims@westminster.ac.uk,,"Selim, Sheikh/0000-0002-7931-092X",,,,,19,3,3,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this article we examine a policy implemented by the Government of Chile that uses temporary measures to reduce the severity and negative health impacts of poor air quality in the short run. This policy involves the announcement of Environmental Episodes on days forecast to have particularly poor air quality. Such Episode announcements trigger a number of government protocols and public notices intended to both improve regional air quality and encourage avoidance behaviors among the populace. By comparing days on which Episodes were announced to observationally similar days before the policy was fully implemented, we demonstrate that the announcement of an Environmental Episode reduces ambient concentrations of particulate matter in the Santiago Metropolitan Region by approximately 20% on the day of implementation, with effects persisting into subsequent days. We also find that the temporary restrictions, government actions, and informational campaigns that make up an Episode reduce mortality among the elderly on the day-of and days-after Episode implementation. Our findings suggest that the Environmental Episode program effectively addresses poor air quality in the short term and could serve as a valuable model for policymakers seeking to augment long-term air quality strategies with a means of addressing temporary spikes in local or regional air pollution levels.","[Mullins, Jamie; Bharadwaj, Prashant] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Mullins, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",jmullins@ucsd.edu,,"Mullins, Jamie/0000-0003-1118-2287; Mullins, Jamie/0000-0002-6827-760X",,,,,44,42,48,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In a collective household model, spouses' optimal on-farm labor supply is such that the marginal rate of technical substitution between male and female labor is equated over different crops. Using the Uganda National Household Survey 2005/06, we test whether this condition holds by estimating production functions and controlling for endogeneity using a method proposed by Gandhi, Navarro, and Rivers (2009). We find that women are less productive than men, that there is more female labor input on low productivity parcels, and that men are relatively more productive on female-controlled plots compared with male-controlled plots. Total farm output could be higher and Pareto improvements could be possible if male labor was reallocated to female-controlled plots and/or female labor was reallocated to male-controlled plots.","[Andrews, Martyn J.] Univ Manchester, Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Golan, Jennifer] Univ Manchester, Dev Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Lay, Jann] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Res Program Dev & Globalizat, Hamburg, Germany; [Lay, Jann] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; German Institute of Global & Area Studies; University of Gottingen,"Andrews, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,"Lay, Jann/AAP-7896-2020","Lay, Jann/0000-0002-0784-3807","Poverty Reduction, Equity, and Growth Network; Economics Department of the University of Manchester","Poverty Reduction, Equity, and Growth Network; Economics Department of the University of Manchester","Jennifer Golan gratefully acknowledges financial support of the Poverty Reduction, Equity, and Growth Network, and the Economics Department of the University of Manchester for funding her PhD.

Using survey data collected in Beijing and Harbin in 2010, this paper simultaneously analyses urban households' milk consumption using a multiple linear model and their willingness-to-pay for milk safety using an ordered choice model. The results of this study show that as income increases, urban households consume more milk and are willing to pay a higher premium for milk safety. Modern food marketing channels play a positive role in stimulating milk consumption and building consumers' confidence in milk safety. The growth in the elderly population influences milk consumption positively, but their demand for milk safety is negatively affected by higher price. The combined analysis of households' demand for milk quantity and safety may be useful to the Chinese government in promoting the development of the domestic milk industry and to dairy firms in exploring the milk market in China.","[Cheng, Leilei] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Changbin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chien, Hsiaoping] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci, Social Sci Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Institute of Desertification Studies, CAF; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences","Cheng, LL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yinchangbin@caas.cn,,,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences project 'Design and Evaluation of a Recycling-based Agricultural Production System in Upland Farming Areas of Northern China'; Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences; Ministry of Agriculture of China [200903011],Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences project 'Design and Evaluation of a Recycling-based Agricultural Production System in Upland Farming Areas of Northern China'; Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences(Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences); Ministry of Agriculture of China(Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs),"The article was written when Cheng was visiting the Social Science Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences.

Not only can this misspecification lead to a biased inference on the output elasticity of inputs, but it also provides a faulty measure of technical efficiency. We extend the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) approach and provide an estimation algorithm to overcome the problem of endogenous input choice in stochastic production frontier estimation by generating consistent estimates of production parameters and technical efficiency. We apply the proposed method to a plant-level panel dataset from the Colombian food manufacturing sector for the period 1982-1998. This dataset provides the value of output and prices charged for each product, expenditures, and prices paid for each material used, energy consumption in kilowatt per hour and energy prices, number of workers and payroll, and book values of capital stock. Empirical results find that the traditional stochastic production frontier tends to underestimate the output elasticity of capital and firm-level technical efficiency. The evidence in this research suggests that addressing the endogeneity issue matters in stochastic production frontier analysis.","[Shee, Apurba] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Shee, A (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya.",a.shee@cgiar.org,"Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017","Stefanou, Spiro/0000-0001-8366-6577",,,,,26,48,48,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The use of individual fishing quotas (IFQs) has been proposed as a promising management tool to cope with these challenges. However, the empirical evidence on the efficacy of this instrument is scarce. Drawing on a stochastic distance frontier analysis, we investigate the impact of the US Gulf of Mexico red snapper IFQ program on fishing capacity, capacity utilisation (CU) and OC. The paper also offers an alternative approach to compute species-specific capacity measurements for multispecies fisheries. Our findings show that following the introduction of the IFQ program, fishing capacity decreased, primarily due to the exit of a large number of fishing vessels. CU increased marginally indicating modest decreases in EC. Conversely, we find that OC remains high. Our estimates suggest that about one-fifth of the actual fleet could harvest the entire quota.","[Solis, Daniel] Florida A&M Univ, CAFS, Agribusiness Program, Div Agr Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [del Corral, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ & Finance, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Perruso, Lawrence; Agar, Juan J.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Social Sci Res Grp, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Solís, D (通讯作者)，Florida A&M Univ, CAFS, Agribusiness Program, Div Agr Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA.",daniel.solis@famu.edu,"Solis, Daniel/B-1031-2009; del Corral, Julio/C-4009-2011","Solis, Daniel/0000-0002-7322-7201; del Corral, Julio/0000-0002-6068-0525",NOAA's Office of Science and Technology,NOAA's Office of Science and Technology,"We would like to thank Alex Chester, Christopher Liese, Assane Diagne and the three anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

In order to circumvent the reflection problem', we consider an identification and estimation strategy employing a generalised spatial two-stage least squares procedure with near-ideal instruments to effectively identify causal influences. Results indicate that neighbour effects are a significant determinant of hybrid rice use. Further, using two specifications of spatial network systems, one based on same-village membership (irrespective of distance) and the other based on geographical distance (irrespective of village boundary), we demonstrate that a network including nearby hybrid rice adopters is more influential than a network of more distant hybrid rice adopters, and merely having a network with a large number of adopters may be relatively meaningless if they are far away. Furthermore, we show that these network effects are much more important to hybrid cultivation than interactions with agricultural extension officers.","[Ward, Patrick S.] Natl Agr Sci Ctr, Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi, India; [Pede, Valerien O.] Int Rice Res Inst, Manila, Philippines",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Ward, PS (通讯作者)，Natl Agr Sci Ctr, Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Prakesh Shastri Marg, New Delhi, India.",p.ward@cgiar.org,"Ward, Patrick S/JDW-3649-2023","Ward, Patrick S/0000-0001-8793-1200",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIARNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This paper was prepared as a contribution to the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA), with generous support provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Spillovers in disease protection create different types of strategic interactions. Under certain conditions, multiple Nash equilibria may arise with the possibility of coordination failure involving excessively low self-protection, in which case individuals' expectations of others' efforts determine which outcome arises. In prior studies, assumed technical relations between self-protection and infection probabilities drove the strategic interactions. We demonstrate that strategic relations can be endogenously determined and depend on the relative endogeneity of risk (RER), defined here as the degree to which individuals can take control of their own risks in a strategic setting. The potential for coordination failure may arise when RER is sufficiently small, whereas larger levels of RER may eliminate this possibility to ensure larger levels of self-protection. We find that imposing a behaviorally-dependent indemnity may increase RER to eliminate the possibility of coordination failure. We apply our analysis to the problem of livestock disease and illustrate the theory using a numerical example of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.","[Reeling, Carson J.; Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Reeling, CJ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",carson.reeling@gmail.com,,"Reeling, Carson/0000-0002-6203-0649","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [2011-67023-30872, 1R01GM100471-01]",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health,"Carson J.

Organic Valley has a unique policy of sustainable and stable producer pay-pricing for organic milk in the emerging organic dairy industry. This case presents challenges faced by the leadership of Organic Valley cooperative to maintain a stable and economically sustainable pay price for its farmer members. This case also introduces students to a new organizational form of cooperative, including its governance, the industry, and the market structure in which the cooperative operates. The objective of this case study is to improve student understanding of economic concepts such as theories of the imperfect market, demand and supply, and organizational design. The case also aims to help students improve their critical thinking and analytical skills by exploring the possibility of maintaining a unique sustainable and stable pricing method through the data provided. Additionally, the story introduces the economic role that organic dairy operation might play for small and medium-size dairy farmers as they attempt to maintain an economically sustainable family farm lifestyle.","[Su, Ye; Cook, Michael L.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Cook, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",CookML@missouri.edu,"Su, Ye/ITV-8936-2023",,Robert D.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of urban economic development on changes in food demand and associated land requirements for food production. Design/methodology/approach - Based on economic estimates from the Almost Ideal Demand System, feed conversion ratios, and crop yields, the authors forecast and compare future dietary patterns and land requirements for two types of urban diets in China. Findings - The results show that the expenditure elasticities of oil and fat, meat, eggs, aquatic products, dairy, and liquor for the diet of capital cities are greater than those for the diet of small-and medium-sized cities. The authors forecast that capital city residents will experience a more rapid rate of increase in per capita demand of meat, eggs, and aquatic products, which will lead to much higher per capita land requirements. Projections indicate that total per capita land demand for food production in capital cities will increase by 9.3 percent, from 1,402 to 1,533 m(2) between 2010 and 2030, while total per capita land demand in small-and medium-sized cities will increase only by 5.3 percent, from 1,192 to 1,255 m(2). Originality/value - The results imply that urban economic development can significantly affect the final outcomes of land requirements for food production. Urban economic development is expected to accelerate the rate of change toward an affluent diet, which can lead to much higher future land requirements.","[Jiang, Li] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Seto, Karen C.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Bai, Junfei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Yale University; China Agricultural University,"Jiang, L (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",li.jiang@ruc.edu.cn,"Seto, Karen C./C-2722-2008","Seto, Karen C./0000-0002-4928-2446","Scientific Research Foundation for Introduced Talents of Renmin University of China; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Scientific Research Foundation for Introduced Talents of Renmin University of China; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This research was financially supported by the Scientific Research Foundation for Introduced Talents of Renmin University of China.,,67,29,38,5,99,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

These provisions are a bundle of attributes a landholder must accept with contract enrollment, leading to transaction costs in the contracting process. This article develops a principal-agent framework to study the links between these transaction costs and the well-known information asymmetries between the landholders and the government agency offering contracts. Using stated choice data collected from a sample of farmers, we estimate a mixed logit model to quantify the contribution of different contract attributes on contract willingness-to-accept (WTA). More stringent provisions in contracts were found to raise individual WTA by widely differing amounts across farmers, but the average effects imply that overall contract supply is sensitive to stringency. From a series of microsimulations based on the estimated model, we find that transaction costs create a significant drain on the cost-effectiveness of contracting from the agency's point of view, similar in magnitude to the inefficiency created by hidden information. Although stringent contractual terms raise program expenditures, they may be justified if they raise compliance rates enough to offset the added cost. We also simulate an implicit frontier to trace out the change in compliance needed to justify a given increase in stringency. For environmental benefits in the range of previous estimates, this analysis suggests that stringent terms would need to substantially raise compliance rates to be cost effective.","[Peterson, Jeffrey M.; Leatherman, John C.; Hendricks, Nathan P.; Fox, John A.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Smith, Craig M.] Ft Hays State Univ, Dept Agr, Hays, KS 67601 USA",Kansas State University,"Peterson, JM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Peterson, Jeffrey M/A-9335-2008","Hendricks, Nathan/0000-0001-7301-8314",USEPA's Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program [RD-831J77401-0]; USEPA's Section 319 and Kansas Water Plan funds by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment; USDA-NIFA Multistate Project [W-2190],USEPA's Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program; USEPA's Section 319 and Kansas Water Plan funds by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment; USDA-NIFA Multistate Project,"The authors are grateful to AJAE editor Brian Roe and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

We examine the effect of heterogeneous landowners' risk and time preferences and land quality on the optimal mix and equilibrium terms of these contracts, which jointly maximize the net benefits of the refinery and landowners in a region; this has implications for the extent to which energy crop production is likely to be vertically integrated or independently contracted by a biorefinery. We find that the refinery can potentially earn a higher profit by offering a choice of these three types of contracts rather than a single type of contract only; by allowing self-selection of contract type based on landowner risk and time preferences, the contractual terms needed to induce production of energy crops are reduced. Although it is optimal for vertically-integrated and contracted production to co-exist, we find that the share of the former is predominant across a range of assumptions about the distribution of risk preferences, time preferences, and relative riskiness of conventional and energy crop production. We also find that the impact of having multiple contract types to choose from on landowners' welfare is ambiguous.","[Yang, Xi] Univ Illinois, Energy Biosci Inst, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Paulson, Nicholas D.; Khanna, Madhu] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Khanna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61801 USA.",khanna1@illinois.edu,,,Energy Biosciences Institute; National Science Foundation; NIFA/USDA,Energy Biosciences Institute; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIFA/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Funding for this research from the Energy Biosciences Institute, the National Science Foundation, and NIFA/USDA is gratefully acknowledged.",,49,16,16,2,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

They have emphasised that adjustment pressures faced by farmers are linked to economy-wide growth processes and that adjustment problems have been aggravated by past government policies, including closer settlement and measures distorting markets for agricultural outputs and inputs. Economists who argued that provision of adjustment assistance would be preferable to price support policies helped to change the focus of agricultural policy toward facilitating adjustment. When rural adjustment schemes were established in the early 1970s, the case for them was made largely in terms of impediments to efficient adjustment in capital and labour markets. However, the schemes involved elements of 'government failure', especially concessional interest rates. Over the following decades, as economists became increasingly sceptical about market failure rationales, adjustment assistance schemes gradually became decreasingly important. Nevertheless, there is ongoing support for the view that adjustment assistance can sometimes enable less efficient and less equitable polices to be avoided.",,,,geoffwedwards@hotmail.com; winton_bates@msn.com.au,,,,,,,63,4,5,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Special attention is given to the rural household's two-stage budgeting in total food expenditure and then to a demand for a specific food item. Conditional and unconditional expenditure and price elasticities for seven food groups are estimated. Results indicate that own-price elasticities for each group are negative ranging from fairly inelastic to elastic range. Expenditure elasticities indicate that food items are a normal necessity to luxury goods. Additionally, socio-demographic factors play a significant role in food consumption patterns. Based on our unconditional expenditure elasticities, we also project food demand from rural Indian households for next two decades.","[Khanal, Aditya R.] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, 3500 John A Merritt Blvd, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Keithly, Walter] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Tennessee State University; Arizona State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",akhanal1@tnstate.edu; Ashok.K.Mishra@asu.edu; Walterk@lsu.edu,,"Khanal, Aditya/0000-0001-8127-2320",,,,,36,16,16,1,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

We implement panel cointegration models to analyze the stock indices of agribusiness firms in the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), European Union (EU), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Based on the literature on market integration and stock return pricing, we identify nine possible determinants of stock market integration, which we separate into three categories: individual market performance, macroeconomic conditions, and agricultural trade. In our analysis, we account for agriculture-specific factors to control for possible structural shifts in financial markets regimes by including the two main commodity price bubbles during last 20 years. Our results show that most of the variables included in our categories have been important factors in promoting regional stock market integration. Moreover, integration among regional stock markets was strengthened by the implementation of trade agreements. This effect is stronger in trade blocs with fewer members, such as NAFTA and MERCOSUR, compared with larger and more heterogeneous blocs, such as the EU and APEC.","[Valdes, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Ave Brasil 2830,Piso 7, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdes, Rodrigo; Von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan; Engler, Alejandra] Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Dept Econ Agr, Casilla 747-721, Talca, Chile; [Von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Engler, Alejandra] Nucleo Milenio CESIEP, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad de Talca; University of Gottingen,"Valdes, R (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Ave Brasil 2830,Piso 7, Valparaiso, Chile.;Valdes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Dept Econ Agr, Casilla 747-721, Talca, Chile.",rodrigo.valdes@pucv.cl,,"Engler, Alejandra/0000-0002-8154-5971; Valdes Salazar, Rodrigo Andres/0000-0003-3789-3562",Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) [21120286],Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

While previous studies have found that risk aversion affects pesticide use in China, they have focused primarily on commercial cotton farmers. In this study, we consider the case of smaller, semisubsistence and subsistence farmers in a poor and landlocked province of China (Yunnan). We use a field experiment to measure risk aversion and collect detailed data on farm production and input use to specifically ask whether risk aversion affects pesticide use, and whether this effect differs for subsistence farmers producing exclusively for home consumption versus semisubsistence farmers who produce both for home and the market. We find that risk aversion significantly increases pesticide use, particularly for subsistence farmers and for market plots by semisubsistence farmers. Further, this effect of risk aversion significantly decreases with farm size for subsistence farmers, but not for semisubsistence farmers, implying that pesticide use may be used to ensure sufficient food supply for home consumption. Finally, we find barriers to the use of pesticides for subsistence farmers, both in terms of financial constraints and economies of scale. This finding implies that risk-mitigation strategies, such as crop insurance, may not target food security concerns of subsistence farmers. Given these different motivations for pesticide use, policymakers may wish to consider effective tools to support rural food security for farmers in the poorer regions of China in order to decrease pesticide use.","[Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Baylis, Kathy] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kozak, Robert; Bull, Gary] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Renmin University of China; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of British Columbia,"Gong, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203223]; Renmin University of China for International Publications [11XNC002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Renmin University of China for International Publications,Financial support of this research is from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71203223) and Renmin University of China for International Publications (Project No. 11XNC002).,,51,83,93,11,133,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We examine how microcredit affects different measures of food security; namely, household calorie availability, dietary diversity indicators and anthropometric status of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and children under the age of 5 years. We find that microcredit programme participation increases calorie availability both at the intensive and extensive margins, but does not improve dietary diversity and only has mixed effects on the anthropometric measures. We also find that the effect of microcredit participation on food security may be non-linear in which participation initially has either no effect on food security or may actually worsen it, before improving it in the longer run.

There are now new high-yielding green super rice (GSR) cultivars developed at the International Rice Research Institute with increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. But a clear understanding of the economic benefits of these varieties under farmers' production environments is not yet fully understood. In this article, we assess the yield and income effects of GSR rice varieties using a two-year panel data from one province. We use matched samples from a propensity score matching method and a fixed-effects model within a difference-in-difference (DID) framework to estimate the yield effects. The income effects were evaluated using the parameter estimates from the yield/production function model. The results of the ordinary least squares and DID fixed-effects regressions reveal significant and positive effects of GSR varieties on yield. The most important finding is that the benefits from these varieties are strongly felt when there is flooding. This evidence was not as robust when matched samples were used. However, it is clear that the yield benefits from GSR varieties could improve rice food security and help alleviate poverty in the country.","[Yorobe, Jose M., Jr.; Pede, Valerien O.] IRRI, Social Sci Div, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Yorobe, Jose M., Jr.] Univ Philippines, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Ali, Jauhar] Int Rice Res Inst, Plant Breeding Genet & Biotechnol, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Velarde, Orlee.

To allow for nonlinearity in the cointegration process, researchers may specify thresholds to break the error correction process into regimes according to whether the retail price is above, below, or close to its equilibrium value given farm prices. However, because the coefficients in a VECM can change when there is movement from one regime to another, the model can be discontinuous. This implies sudden, hard regime changes. In this study, we extend the threshold VECM to include features of smooth transition autoregression (STAR) models.

The data includes all transactions between vessels and wholesalers that occurred within local fish markets in France during 2007. Spatial disparities in fish prices are sizable even after taking into account fish quality, time, and unobserved seller and buyer heterogeneity. The price difference between local fish markets can be explained to some extent by distance, but mostly by a coast effect related to market locations on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. We also propose a new approach for identifying groups of interconnected local fish markets based on the activity of sellers and buyers within these markets. We show that most markets on the Atlantic coast are well connected, and that variation in prices across these markets is very small and in line with the law of one price.","[Gobillon, Laurent] INED, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Gobillon, Laurent] Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Paris, France; [Gobillon, Laurent; Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, Lab Econ & Management Nantes Atlant, Nantes, France",Paris School of Economics; Nantes Universite,"Gobillon, L (通讯作者)，INED, Shah Alam, Malaysia.;Gobillon, L (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Paris, France.",gobillon@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,25,11,11,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The main emphasis has been put on the period after the accession to the EU. Primarily such changes are identified, that occurred in the relation to the EU-Member States and to third countries. The results show that the value of agricultural exports and imports was growing during the surveyed period while the growth rate of agricultural exports was above the growth rate of agricultural imports. Agricultural exports increased from CZK 78 billion in 2005 to more than CZK 160 billion in 2013 and the imports rose from CZK 103 billion to more than CZK 184 billion in the same period. The territorial structure of the foreign agrarian trace is continuously concentrating on the EU-Single Market, both in terms of exports and imports. Exports of milk, milk products, cereals, beverages, food preparations, tobacco and tobacco manufactures, cereal preparations, food residues and waste, oilseeds, vegetable fats and oils, sugar and confectionery belong to the most important commodity aggregations. The share of processed products in the total exports increased and reached currently about 7%. The export - import coverage ratio reached a satisfactory trend as well. Although the Czech Republic does not have ideal conditions for the export-oriented agriculture, the country is able to gain comparative advantages, at least at the level of following aggregations: HS10, HS01, HS12, HS24, HS04, HS17, HS15, HS11, HS16, HS22, HS03 a HS13.","[Smutka, Lubos; Svatos, Miroslav; Tomsik, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sergienko, Olga Ivanovna] State Univ Informat Technol Mech & Opt, St Petersburg, Russia",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; ITMO University,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Sergienko, Olga/ABA-8632-2020; Svatos, Miroslav/H-4459-2018; Tomsik, Karel/I-2507-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Svatos, Miroslav/0000-0002-2831-287X; Tomsik, Karel/0000-0002-0396-3553","FEM, CULS Prague [20151031]","FEM, CULS Prague","Supported by Internal grant agency, FEM, CULS Prague (Grant No. 20151031).",,18,19,19,4,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This is particularly true when the analysis is performed on the reference farm where estimates are based on the average aggregated data. The paper illustrates how the combination of different mathematical programming methods could be efficiently used to analyse the farm-production plan with the lack of the on-farm accounting data. The utilised approach shows how the holistic analysis of production planning as a multi-criteria problem could be conducted. The estimation of the missing information and the disaggregation of the endogenous farm data is enabled through different models that are based on the constrained optimisation. The developed models are linked into the spreadsheet modular tool enabling systematic analyses of the farm decision making under risky conditions. Illustration of the modular tool application is given via the analyses of three hypothetic dairy farms. The obtained results indicate that the developed approach enables holistic analyses of the production planning. The methodology applied provides also important information for the measures aimed to increase efficiency as well as to benchmarking the performance of different farm types.

Taking into account both marginal risk benefits and marginal subsidy effects suggests that most farmers have chosen lower coverage levels than would be predicted by standard models. By modeling financial outcomes as gains and losses, cumulative prospect theory offers an alternative framework to perhaps better understand farmers' purchase decisions. The role of the reference point that defines outcomes as either a gain or a loss, the degree of loss aversion, curvature of the value function, and the probability weighting function in determining optimal crop insurance coverage levels are explored for three representative farms calibrated to 2009 conditions. Loss aversion and how crop insurance is framed through choice of the reference point are shown to be the key factors that determine whether predictions from prospect theory are consistent with observed crop insurance coverage choices. When crop insurance is framed as a tool to manage farm risk then optimal choices under prospect theory are not consistent with observed choices. If crop insurance is framed as a stand-alone investment where a loss is felt if the indemnity received is less than the premium paid, then prospect theory can generate optimal coverage level choices that are largely consistent with observed decisions. This result is shown to be robust to changes in parameterizations as long as loss aversion is maintained and if curvature of the value function is accompanied by decision weights that overweight low probability outcomes.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Biobased Ind Ctr, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Babcock, BA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Biobased Ind Ctr, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,,15,76,94,7,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In the waning decades of the 20th century, U.S. policymakers opted to ratchet down the rate of growth in public support for food and agricultural R&D. As the 21st century unfolds, slowing growth has given way to real cutbacks, reversing the accumulation of U.S.-sourced public R&D capital over most of the previous century and more. The 2014 Farm Bill did little to reverse these long-run research funding trajectories-politicians failed to heed the economic evidence about the still substantial social payoffs of that research and the consequent slowdown in U.S. agricultural productivity growth associated with the spending slowdown. Meanwhile, R&D spending by other countries has been moving in different directions. We present new evidence that today's middle-income countries-notably China, Brazil, and India-are not only growing in relative importance as producers of agricultural innovations through investments in public R&D, they are also gaining considerable ground in terms of their share of privately performed research of relevance for agriculture. The already substantive changes in global public and private R&D investment trajectories are accelerating. If history is any guide to the future, these changing R&D trajectories could have profound consequences for the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture in the decades ahead.","[Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Chan-Kang, Connie] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Dehmer, Steven P.] Health Partners Inst Educ & Res, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Pardey, Philip G.; Beddow, Jason M.; Dehmer, Steven P.] InSTePP Ctr, St Paul, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Pardey, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Dehmer, Steven/0000-0003-3508-9239; Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341",University of Minnesota's MNDrive Global Food Ventures Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; InSTePP,University of Minnesota's MNDrive Global Food Ventures Initiative; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); InSTePP,"Philip G.

We find, for this data set, serious differences in magnitudes of interest.","[Guerra, Ernesto Alex, V] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bobenrieth H, Eugenio Sebastian Antonio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bobenrieth H, Juan Rodrigo Andres] Univ Bio Bio, Concepcion, Chile; [Cafiero, Carlo] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Div Stat, Rome, Italy",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad del Bio-Bio; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Bobenrieth, ES (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",ebobenrieth@uc.cl,"VALLEJOS, ERNESTO GUERRA/AAB-4922-2019; Bobenrieth, Eugenio/N-6898-2014","Cafiero, Carlo/0000-0003-3652-9910; Bobenrieth, Juan/0000-0002-1302-5464; GUERRA VALLEJOS, ERNESTO/0000-0002-9844-3576; Bobenrieth, Eugenio/0000-0001-9899-4186","CONICYT/Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [1130257, 1090017]; Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo, Chile [NS 100046]","CONICYT/Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo, Chile","We thank, with the usual caveat, Brian Wright for helpful discussions.

Different approaches are followed to test the transferability of the estimated values, aiming to minimise transfer errors for use in policy analysis, comparing both single- and multicountry transfers, with and without socio-economic adjustments. Within Europe, significant differences are found between implicit prices for environmental water use, but not for domestic water use. In the Australian case study, alleviating restrictions on domestic water use has no significant value. Pooling the three European samples improves the transferability of the environmental flow values between Europe and Australia. Results show that a reduction in transfer error is achieved when controlling for unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity in the single- and multicountry transfers, providing additional support for the superiority of socio-economic adjustment procedures in value transfer.","[Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Martin-Ortega, Julia] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Dekker, Thijs] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Sardonini, Laura; Raggi, Meri; Viaggi, Davide] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Andreu, Joaquin; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Kontogianni, Areti] Univ Western Macedonia, Fac Mech Engn, Kozani, Greece; [Skourtos, Michalis] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Rolfe, John; Windle, Jill] Cent Queensland Univ, Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; James Hutton Institute; University of Leeds; University of Bologna; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Western Macedonia; Agricultural University of Athens; Central Queensland University,"Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.brouwer@vu.nl,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017; Raggi, Meri/D-1260-2011; Dekker, Thijs/M-7763-2013; Viaggi, Davide/A-3223-2009; PULIDO-VELAZQUEZ, MANUEL/N-1619-2014; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Raggi, Meri/0000-0001-6960-1099; Dekker, Thijs/0000-0003-2313-8419; PULIDO-VELAZQUEZ, MANUEL/0000-0001-7009-6130; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Kontogianni, Areti/0000-0002-9183-6211; Martin-Ortega, Julia/0000-0003-0002-6772",European Directorate-General Research Framework Programme 6 [SSPI-022723],European Directorate-General Research Framework Programme 6,"This study was carried out as part of the European Directorate-General Research Framework Programme 6 funded project AquaMoney (SSPI-022723).

While many studies have examined its aggregate impacts, few have investigated how it affects the poor. This paper helps fill this gap by applying a new procedure to explore the ex post impacts of improved maize varieties on poverty in rural Ethiopia. Plot-level yield and cost changes due to adoption are first estimated using instrumental variable and marginal treatment effect techniques where possible heterogeneity is carefully accounted for. A backward derivation procedure is then developed to link treatment effect estimates with an economic surplus model to identify the counterfactual household income that would have existed without improved maize varieties. Poverty impacts are finally estimated by exploiting the differences between observed and counterfactual income distributions. Improved maize varieties have led to a 0.8-1.3 percentage drop of poverty headcount ratio and relative reductions of poverty depth and severity. However, poor producers benefit the least from adoption due to the smallness of their land holdings.","[Zeng, Di; Alwang, Jeffrey; Norton, George W.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Shiferaw, Bekele] Partnership Econ Policy, Nairobi 00621, Kenya; [Jaleta, Moti] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Yirga, Chilot] Ethiopian Inst Agr Res, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR),"Zeng, D (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",di83@vt.edu,"Alwang, Jeffrey/AAA-1716-2020; Zeng, Di/O-8947-2019","Zeng, Di/0000-0001-6403-5606; Alwang, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2950-8516; Shiferaw, Bekele/0000-0002-3645-320X",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR),"This study is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the project of Diffusion and Impact of Improved Varieties in Africa (DIIVA) led by the CGIAR Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA).

After controlling for the endogeneity of migration through an instrumental variable estimation our empirical results show that international migration has a significantly positive effect on the accumulated agricultural assets but not on livestock capital.

Based on a survey of 1,653 rice farmers in China, our econometric analyses show that the severity of drought and flood in the study areas significantly increases the risk and downside risk of rice yield. The applied farm management measures respond to severe drought and flood and can be considered as adaptation to climate change, an issue often ignored in previous studies. We model adaptation and its impact on rice yield for adapters and non-adapters. Utilizing a moment-based approach, we show that adaptation through farm management measures significantly increases rice yield and reduces the risk and downside risk of rice yield. Several policies, including scaling up the cost-effective farm management adaptation and providing public services related to natural disasters, are recommended to improve adaptive capacity of farmers, particular the poor, in response to extreme events.","[Huang, Jikun; Wang, Jinxia] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yangjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Central South University; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"International Development Research Center [107093-001]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955700]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71161140351, 71333013]; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070]","International Development Research Center(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research","The authors thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their excellent comments and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach -This paper conducts an empirical comparison of mode effects of two survey methods for improved ecological services in Beijing. Data were collected from a CV survey, which has two subsamples, one using face-to-face interviews and the other employing self-administered drop-off surveys. Findings - There is some evidence of social desirability bias in the face-to-face interviews for the participation question; however, such effects do not carry over to subjects' responses to the contribution decision. No difference is observed in sample demographics between modes. And satisficing effect is not observed in the drop-off survey in this study. Research limitations/implications - More well-controlled mode comparisons are warranted to test the robustness of the results; and collection time effects as well as the use of drop-off surveys for environmental valuation with different levels of complexity and familiarity are worthy of further study. Practical implications - The authors find more similarities between drop-off and face-to-face surveys than differences therefore support the practice of self-administered drop-off surveys in CVM for environmental valuation.

Design/methodology/approach - Modified data envelopment analysis is used to measure the TFEE of each sugar mill during the crushing seasons. Then heteroskedastic fractional probit model is applied to estimate the determinants of TFEE because of the bounded nature of TFEE and heteroskedasticity of unbalanced panel. Findings - The results show that throughout the crushing seasons, the average TFEE is 0.57; there are spatial differences of TFEE in Guangxi sugar industry, highest in southern area; the TFEE of foreign-owned sugar mills is larger than that of private-owned and state-owned sugar mills; the larger the enterprise size, the higher the TFEE; private ownership, large size, raw material, safe productivity, total recovery rate as well as technical progress can improve TFEE significantly. Originality/value - This paper analyzes TFEE using a rich data set at firm level, allowing the existence of firm heterogeneity, as well as being complementary to the study of energy efficiency in China's sugar industry. Moreover, ownership structure is involved in the determinants of TFEE, which is rarely done in literature. Lastly, heteroskedastic fractional probit model is employed to recognize the bounded nature of TFEE as well as selection bias of unbalanced panel to study the determinants of TFEE.","[Ru, Lei; Si, Wei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Si, W (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",siweicau@gmail.com,,,National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71303236]; Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) [200983],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD)(Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China),"This research is supported by National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 71303236); A Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of PR China (FANEDD) (No. 200983).

While dynamic economic analysis is clearly applicable, to date there have been no attempts to use it to model burning regimes. This paper develops a delayed-response optimal-control model to describe Aboriginal fire-stick farming. The model explains a collective welfare maximizing burning regime that successfully controlled wildfires, protected the resources essential to survival, and, incidentally, produced a biodiverse landscape and limited greenhouse gas emissions. When the parameters of the model are changed to reflect the current institutional realities of reduced access to the land, and less direct dependence on it, traditional Aboriginal burning is prevented or delayed, fuel loads build up and uncontrolled fires are more likely to occur, damaging previously protected species. If Aboriginal burning is to be used to control fires successfully in a modern resource management context, it is necessary to adjust for changes in the institutional incentive structure. Payments for carbon offsets are an example of replacing lost incentives with new ones.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Wilman, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",eawilman@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,38,6,6,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Their rapid growth in recent years has triggered vigorous debates on their impacts on international trade and development, with many arguing that standards are  non-tariff barriers to trade and that standards are marginalizing the poor. I present conceptual frameworks and review empirical evidence on the equity and efficiency effects and the political economy of standards. Models which incorporate essential aspects of standards yield complex theoretical results and nuanced conclusions. Careful empirical analyses support such nuanced arguments and find complex effects. For trade, standards can create welfare gains but also involve rent redistribution which induces lobbying by interest groups to set the standards at their preferred level. This makes it difficult to distinguish socially desirable standards from those resulting from political rent-seeking. For development, it is crucial to explicitly account for (a) the endogeneity of the institutional organization of value chains and (b) both smallholder contracting and employment creation on large scale farms when considering the impact of standards on development and poverty.","[Swinnen, Johan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Swinnen, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium.",johan.swinnen@econ.kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",KU Leuven (Methusalem and Excellence Financing),KU Leuven (Methusalem and Excellence Financing),"This presentation draws on my collaboration over the past 25 years with many colleagues and students from whom I have learned tremendously.

Basis risk, or remaining uninsured risk, is a widely recognized but rarely measured feature of index insurance product quality. This article uses eight semi-annual seasons of longitudinal household data to examine the distribution of basis risk associated with an index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) product in northern Kenya. We find that IBLI coverage reduces exposure to covariate risk due to large shocks and mitigates downside risk substantially for many households, even at commercial premium rates. But index insurance is no magic bullet; insured households continue to face considerable basis risk. Examining the components of basis risk, we find that IBLI reduces exposure to covariate risk due to high loss events by an average of 63%. The benefits of reduced covariate risk exposure are relatively small, however, due to high exposure to seemingly mostly random idiosyncratic risk, even in this population often thought to suffer largely from covariate shocks. The result is that IBLI policyholders are left with an average of 69% of their original risk due to high loss events. This research underscores the need for caution when promoting index insurance as a risk mitigation tool, as well as the importance of product quality evaluation.","[Jensen, Nathaniel D.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Coll Business, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mude, Andrew G.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Jensen, ND (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721; Jensen, Nathaniel/0000-0002-2946-5771","UK Department for International Development (DfID); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Agriculture and Rural Development Sector of the European Union through DfID accountable grant [202619-101]; DfID through FSD Trust Grant [SWD/Weather/43/2009]; United States Agency for International Development grant [EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; World Bank's Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Grant [7156906]; CGIAR Research Programs on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security and Dryland Systems","UK Department for International Development (DfID); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Agriculture and Rural Development Sector of the European Union through DfID accountable grant; DfID through FSD Trust Grant; United States Agency for International Development grant(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); World Bank's Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Grant; CGIAR Research Programs on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security and Dryland Systems","Nathaniel Jensen is a postdoctoral associate at the Charles H.

Thus, marginal-risk behavior and risk behavior are not inherently different. Rather, they manifest similar behavior evaluated at different gambles.

The Congressional Budget Office (2014) estimates that this act will increase spending on agricultural insurance programs by $5.7 billion to a total of $89.8 billion over the next decade. In light of the sizable resources directed toward these programs, accurate rating of insurance contracts is of the utmost importance to producers, private insurance companies, and the federal government. Unlike most forms of insurance, agricultural insurance is plagued by a paucity of spatially correlated data. A novel interpretation of Bayesian Model Averaging is used to estimate a set of possibly similar densities that offers greater efficiency if the set of densities are similar while seemingly not losing any if the set of densities are dissimilar. Simulations indicate that finite sample performance-in particular small sample performance-is quite promising. The proposed approach does not require knowledge of the form or extent of any possible similarities, is relatively easy to implement, admits correlated data, and can be used with either parametric or nonparametric estimators. We use the proposed approach to estimate U.S. crop insurance premium rates for area-type programs and develop a test to evaluate its efficacy. An out-of-sample game between private insurance companies and the federal government highlights the policy implications for a variety of crop-state combinations. Consistent with the simulation results, the performance of the proposed approach with respect to rating area-type insurance-in particular small sample performance-remains quite promising.","[Ker, Alan P.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Tolhurst, Tor N.; Liu, Yong] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Ker, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aker@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,52,35,45,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

A potentially positive factor will be the elimination of milk quotas in 2015, although a potentially negative factor will be further trade liberalisation and increased import competition. These changes come on top of the move to decouple direct aids to farmers in 2005 as part of the Mid-Term Review of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy agreed in 2003. This paper examines these reforms and their impacts on the Irish economy and income distribution using a CGE model particularly rich in detail on the agri-food sectors, differentiated household groups, and agricultural policy instruments including their links to productive factors and households. The results suggest that the past and projected changes in the policy environment have, in sum, a small positive impact on GDP and household income. However, the gains and losses are unequally distributed across sectors and household groups due to the highly differentiated distribution of support and protection. Although all households generally gain from the sequence of policy reforms in the long run, some experience strong adverse effects from particular reforms and in the medium term.","[Boysen, Ole] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany; [Miller, Ana Corina] Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Matthews, Alan] Trinity Coll Dublin, European Agr Policy, Dublin, Ireland",University Hohenheim; Agri-Food & Biosciences Institute; Trinity College Dublin,"Boysen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany.",boyseno@tcd.ie,"Boysen, Ole/S-9441-2019","Boysen, Ole/0000-0003-2459-4715; Matthews, Alan/0000-0003-1051-1499",,,,,32,7,7,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The objective is to safeguard the livelihood security of farm households in poor countries. To date, most analysis of such tariffs uses stochastic partial equilibrium models with perfect competition. Yet in many markets for such commodities, imperfectly competitive market intermediaries play an important role in determining producers' prices, as do state trading enterprises (STEs). A stochastic partial equilibrium model of a typical importing country situation is specified in which there are either imperfectly competitive domestic intermediaries with a contingent tariff or an STE. The role of these intermediaries in influencing price behaviour and livelihood security in the presence of contingent tariffs alters the conclusion based on models of perfect competition. Using Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that the efficacy of a contingent tariff is substantially reduced as the number of firms declines because increasingly they absorb the tariff, and the procurement price and producer surplus do not increase to the extent that they do under perfect competition.","[MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"MacLaren, D (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",d.maclaren@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Moreover, factor endowments are ambiguously related to IIT as land is found to be negatively, while labour and machinery to be positively related to both sides of the IIT. Results also show that product differentiation fosters two way trade of the quality-differentiated goods as a positive relationship exists between the agricultural employment and IIT. As to productivity, all model runs show a negative relationship for HIIT but positive for VIIT, implying that low-quality product exports dominate the agri-food trade of the Baltic Countries.

Design/methodology/approach - The data of rural household income per capita are employed to compute the transitional dynamics in the rural sector. The analyses are conducted at two spatial levels, namely, the national and provincial levels. Ergodic distributions are computed to provide a forecast of future income distributions, whereas Mobility Probability Plots are constructed to offer detailed information on the transitional dynamics. Findings - The income distributions are found to have considerable persistence. Another finding is that most of the households (except the extremely low-income households) have a tendency of moving downwards in the income distribution though they are more likely to remain in the same levels of relative income because of their high persistence. Convergence to a unimodal income distribution is possible in the long run, however, the households will converge to a value which is far below China's per capita gross domestic product. Research limitations/implications - Since a lot of the rural households would congregate to the lower part of the income distribution if the transitional dynamics remain unchanged, therefore, it calls for government intervention. Practical implications - More resources should be diverted to the rural sector. Social implications - The finding also shows that the provinces have very different transitional dynamics even if they are situated in the same economic zone. Thus, the government should formulate province-specific development polices so as to promote greater equality. Originality/value - Given that no recent research has been conducted on convergence and transitional dynamics of rural household income. Therefore, this paper attempts to fill the gap in the literature by investigating the pattern and future development of rural household income in China through the use of stochastic kernel approach.","[Li, Shi] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheong, Tsun Se] Hang Seng Management Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong,"Cheong, TS (通讯作者)，Hang Seng Management Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jamescheong@hsmc.edu.hk,,,,,,,49,11,11,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The authors also want to provide quantitative evidence on the individual characteristics of the clinicians who provide health care to villagers in rural China and whether we should expect these individuals to be interested in continuing to supply quality health care in China's villages in the coming years. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data from a survey of rural China's village clinicians conducted in five provinces, 25 counties, and 101 villages in 2005 and 2012. This paper also uses qualitative data from interviews with 31 village clinicians. Using a mixed methods approach, this study describes the turnover of village clinicians and the main factors that impact the career decisions of clinicians. Findings - Turnover of China's village doctors, while not trivial (about 25 percent of village doctors exited their field between 2005 and 2012), is still not overly high. Only five out of 101 villages did not have village clinicians in 2012. Of those that lost village doctors between 2005 and 2012, nearly all of them still had a village doctor in 2012 (either taken over by another local clinician or the position was taken by a newcomer). The authors find that three main sets of factors are correlated with the career decisions of village clinicians: village clinicians' opportunity cost, the profitability of running a village clinic, and commitment to the field of medicine. In general, clinicians who left the village faced a much higher opportunity cost, had been running a clinic that was not profitable, and had fewer ties to the field of medicine. Newcomers over the same period had higher levels of education, went to higher profit clinics between 2005 and 2012, and had a stronger commitment to the field. Originality/value - This study makes use of a data set with a large and nationally representative sample to provide a new perspective to better understand clinician turnover at village clinics, the career decisions of clinicians, and the implied trends for the quality and access to rural health care services in the future.","[Xue, Hao; Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, CEEE, Xian, Peoples R China; [Medina, Alexis] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Shaanxi Normal University; Stanford University,"Shi, YJ (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, CEEE, Xian, Peoples R China.",shiyaojiang7@gmail.com,"Xue, Hao/GXV-4717-2022; Xue, Hao/Y-5234-2018","Xue, Hao/0000-0002-9683-5541",111 Project [B16031],"111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the 111 Project (Grant No. B16031).,,28,8,8,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Based on a meta-analysis of 387 calorie-income elasticities collected from 90 primary studies, it is found that the threshold income for calorie demand transition is $460 in 2012 prices. This implies that the transitional threshold for calorie consumption is $1.26/day, which is slightly lower than the World Bank's poverty line ($1.25/day in 2005 purchasing power parity prices) after deflation.

This estimation is conducted by using a birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo method. State-contingent output is estimated conditioned on an observed input vector and an a priori unknown number of unobserved states, each of which is modeled as a component of a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In a panel data application, state-independent dummy variables are used to control for time effects. The model is applied to 44 rice farms in the Philippines operating between 1990 and 1997. The endogenous estimation procedure indicates a unimodal posterior probability distribution on the number of states, with a median of three states. The estimated posterior coefficient values and their economic implications are compared to those of previous research that had assumed a fixed number of states determined exogenously. Goodness-of-fit testing is performed for the first time for a state-contingent production model. The results indicate satisfactory fit and also provide insights regarding the degree of estimation error reduction achieved by utilizing a distribution for the number of states instead of a point estimate. All of our models show significant improvement in terms of mean squared error of in-sample predictions against previous work. This application also demonstrates that using a state-independent dummy time trend instead of a state-contingent linear time trend leads to slightly smaller differences in state mean output levels, although input elasticities remain state-contingent.","[Arreola, Jose Luis Preciado; Johnson, Andrew L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Johnson, AL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ajohnson@tamu.edu,"Johnson, Andrew/B-7226-2012",,Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) [209414],Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The authors would like to thank the seminar audiences at Aalto University and the North American Productivity Workshop.

We outline the history of government assistance to the sector after Federation. Six measures of assistance are examined. Then the nominal rates of assistance from these measures are calculated for 20 agricultural products, 14 of which are classified as exportables and 6 as importables. From these product measures of assistance, we construct a series of the production-weighted average nominal rate of assistance for the group of exportable products and for the group of importable products and for the whole sector. Our results show that, from the time of Federation, the pattern of assistance to the sector discriminated persistently and heavily against the exportable agricultural products.","[Lloyd, Peter; MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Fac Econ & Commerce, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Lloyd, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Econ & Commerce, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",pjlloyd@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Significant differences exist in farm shares across food commodities with higher farm shares for livestock products and lower farm shares for grain-based products. The decline in the Canadian farm share for food consumed at home is driven in large part by the food purchasing habits of consumers. This paper also addresses the hypothesis that the decline in the Canadian farm share could be partially driven by rising input costs in post-farmgate processes or rising input costs that have greater impact on downstream sectors than primary agricultural producers. Three experiments were conducted to assess the impact of an increase in the cost of corn, energy, and farm labor would have on commodity output prices, farm returns, food expenditure, and farm share. In all three cases, the overall farm share increases, albeit by a small amount, suggesting that these shocks have a larger relative impact on the prices of agricultural commodities than the prices of marketing commodities used in post-farmgate activities. A two-period comparison of these simulations shows that energy (corn and farm labour) price shocks would have had a greater (lower) impact on the farm share in 2007 than 1997.","[Kelly, Jessica; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Canning, Patrick] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",University of Guelph; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aweersin@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593",Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF),Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF),"The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of Ken Nakagawa from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and the helpful comments from Ken Hansen, Howard Leathers, Nicolas Rockler, John Cranfield, and Brady Deaton.

Hence, many of them are more or less delinked from the market. It is well recognized, however, that market participation is crucial for farm households to ensure a flow of cash income, leading to poverty alleviation and improved livelihoods. Thus, it is meaningful to understand what factors affect farm households' decision to sell food crops, which is important for strengthening their linkages with markets. The empirical literature on impacts of market linkages has seldom focused on the determinants of market participation. Using rice farm households in Bangladesh and applying a double-hurdle model, this article demonstrates that the provision of general education and the development of agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation facilities can strengthen the market linkages of farm households by enhancing their marketable surplus through increased production. By contrast, rainfall beyond the optimum level, drought spells, and flood incidences can weaken market linkages by reducing their marketable surplus through decreased production. Specific policies such as investment in general education are drawn up based on the findings.","[Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Manila 1099, Philippines; [Mohanty, Samarendu] Int Rice Res Inst, Targeting & Policy, Manila 1099, Philippines; [Mohanty, Samarendu; Nelson, Andrew] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Manila 1099, Philippines",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Cereal Syst Initiat, South Asia Mechanizat & Irrigat CSISA MI, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org,"Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019; Nelson, Andy/G-3649-2012","Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152; Nelson, Andy/0000-0002-7249-3778",,,,,40,13,14,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This relationship is studied using a 'distance to the frontier' model which is based on a non-monotonic relationship between competition and innovation. Quality is inferred from trade data using an innovative method recently proposed by Khandelwal. The results strongly support the existence of a non-monotonic relationship between competition and quality upgrading, with varieties close to the world frontier being more likely to upgrade quality in response to an increase in import competition. This relationship holds true for both developing and developed countries and is even stronger for countries/products targeted by specific FDI policies. Moreover, there is a strong positive relationship between the diffusion of EU voluntary standard and quality upgrading.","[Curzi, Daniele; Raimondi, Valentina; Olper, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Olper, Alessandro] Univ Leuven KUL, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium",University of Milan; KU Leuven,"Curzi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",daniele.curzi@unimi.it,"RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/AGY-1199-2022","Curzi, Daniele/0000-0002-1596-5126; RAIMONDI, VALENTINA/0000-0002-5431-7885",European Union [312029 COMPETE],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors thank the participants in several conferences and meetings, the editor and the anonymous referees for the European Review of Agricultural Economics for useful comments and suggestions.

A new challenge is to meet the food demands of an expanding world population in the face of pessimistic climate change scenarios and the increasing scarcity of land. Can Brazil help meet rising world food demand while conserving its tropical rainforests? To address this question we simulate outcomes using a large dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium model of Brazil to model land use over 20 years in 90 zones and 14 agricultural sectors. The model features a land-use change module based on a transition matrix obtained from satellite imagery. We analyze two scenarios of deforestation reduction, both linked to actual policy proposals. Model results indicate several mechanisms that allow food output to increase without expanding land supply. In particular, we stress the role of Brazil's vast, low-yield pasture area as a source of future cropland. Thus, we find that controlling deforestation leads to rather small decreases in food output-which could be neutralized by tiny exogenous productivity improvements. We conclude that the decrease in deforestation will not significantly compromise Brazilian agricultural supply capacity in the foreseeable future.","[de Souza Ferreira Filho, Joaquim Bento] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Coll Agr, Dept Econ Management & Sociol, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ribera, Luis] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Horridge, Mark] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Victoria University,"Ferreira, JBD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Coll Agr, Dept Econ Management & Sociol, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",jbsferre@usp.br,"Horridge, Jonathan Mark/A-6008-2008","Horridge, Jonathan Mark/0000-0002-1070-5763",,,,,25,21,25,4,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

A key metric often used as a proxy for research quality is the ranking of the journal in which a manuscript appears. While citation-based measures of journal quality are commonly used, less is known about other dimensions of journal quality and prestige. We report results from an international study using Best-Worst Scaling to investigate researchers' journal preferences. Respondents used two criteria to assess journals: the impact a paper in the journal would have on career progression, and the impact beyond academia of papers in the journal. Among the sample of journals studied, the American Journal of Agricultural Economics is ranked at the top for career progression for the aggregate sample, while Science was rated at the top for broader impact. We find no significant correlation between the journal scores based on the two criteria, nor between them and the journals' impact factors. These results suggest that impact beyond academia is poorly aligned with career incentives and that citation measures reflect poorly, if at all, peers' esteem of journals. Heteroscedastic scale-adjusted latent class models reveal marked heterogeneity in journal preferences related to researchers' institutional affiliation and geographic region. We find significant differences in error variance over people and choices: people were less consistent when choosing their least, as opposed to their most, preferred journal. This finding has broader implications given the burgeoning use of best-worst surveys.","[Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Environm Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University of Manchester; University of Western Australia; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Rigby, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Environm Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",dan.rigby@manchester.ac.uk; michael.burton@uwa.edu.au; jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,"burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009","burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740",Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES); Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA); Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE); Agricultural Economics Society (AES); European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE); European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE); International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE),Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES); Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA); Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE); Agricultural Economics Society (AES); European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE); European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE); International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE),"The cooperation and support from the following academic associations is gratefully acknowledged: Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society (AARES), Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA), Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE), Agricultural Economics Society (AES), European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE), and International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE).

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the main social protection policies in China and India and analyzes the challenges that they are facing. This analysis is based on an evaluation of poverty and food security trends in both countries among vulnerable and disadvantaged groups followed by an overview of major experiences and gaps in social protection policies in the two emerging Asian giants. Findings - Improving the coverage and targeting of social protection systems is vital, and will require a multi-faceted reform portfolio that promotes more integrated and horizontally equitable systems. Emphasis should be placed on developing productive, cross-sectoral social protection programs that combine short-term social safety support with long-term tools to enhance productivity, paying special attention to nutrition, health, and human capital development. More efficient coverage and targeting should bridge the rural and urban divide and be grounded in transparent criteria and procedures that govern program implementation at all levels of the government. As both countries become more urbanized, social protection programs need to give equal attention to emerging food insecurity and nutrition issues within urban areas without detracting from food security and nutrition efforts in rural areas. Originality/value - Faced with a sizable population of undernourished and poor people, India and China have applied rather different approaches to address food insecurity. The originality and value of this paper lie in an in-depth parallel analysis of how China and India can better use their social protection systems to address food insecurity and undernutrition among poor, vulnerable, and disadvantaged groups.","[Brzeska, Joanna; Fan, Shenggen] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Das, Mousumi] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Brzeska, J (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",j.brzeska@cgiar.org,,,,,,,86,7,8,6,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This condition failed to hold in grain markets for most of 2005-2010, calling into question the ability of these markets to perform their price discovery and risk management functions. During this period, futures contracts expired up to 35% above the cash grain price. We develop a dynamic rational expectations model of commodity storage that explains how these recent convergence failures were generated by the institutional structure of the delivery system. When delivery occurs on a grain futures contract, the firm on the short side of the market provides a delivery instrument (a warehouse receipt or shipping certificate) to the firm on the long side of the market. The firm taking delivery may hold the delivery instrument indefinitely, providing it pays a daily storage rate. The futures exchange sets the maximum allowable storage rate at a fixed value. We show that non-convergence arises in equilibrium when the market price of physical grain storage exceeds the maximum storage rate on delivery instruments. We call the difference between the price of carrying physical grain and the maximum storage rate the wedge, and demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the magnitude of the non-convergence equals the expected present discounted value of a function of future wedges.","[Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Off Futures & Options Res, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",adsmith@ucdavis.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848","Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture [58-3000-9-0078, 58-3000-9-0076]","Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","Philip Garcia is the T.A.

The Northern Adriatic Sea is considered a good case study by which to test this approach, given the richness of species landed there and their heterogeneous distribution across the space involved. Three groups of demersal species (whitefish, cephalopods, and crustaceans) are chosen for the study. First, geographical market boundaries are defined for each product (species) using price-price relations between market places. Second, demand is analyzed inside the defined market area through the linear approximation of the inverse almost ideal demand system. Geographical market integration bears several patterns of complete or partial integration, depending on the species. It could be said that integration is higher for species of high economic relevance among regions where large quantities are landed. For all product groups, our estimations suggest that moderate substitution effects do exist among species. The characteristics of the fleets and of the buyers, as well as the biophysical attributes of the sea basin (i.e., species richness and heterogeneous spatial distribution) are discussed as explanatory variables of market integration/segmentation.","[Mulazzani, Luca; Malorgio, Giulio] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Manrique, Rosa] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Trevisan, Giovanna] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Mulazzani, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Viale Fanin 50, Bologna, Italy.",luca.mulazzani@unibo.it,,"Mulazzani, Luca/0000-0003-2336-9399; Manrique, Rosa/0000-0002-0206-5903",,,,,37,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Given the DDA's slow progress, that implementation may not be completed before the end of the next decade. Ex-ante analysis of the DDA's possible effects thus requires first modelling the world economy to 2030 and, in that process, projecting what trade-related policies might be by then without a DDA. Typically, modellers assume the counterfactual policy regime to be a business-as-usual' projection assuming the status quo. Yet we know developing country governments tend to switch from taxing to assisting farmers in the course of economic development. This paper shows the difference made by including political economy-determined agricultural protection growth endogenously in the baseline projection. We reveal that difference by projecting the world economy to 2030 using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model with those two alternative policy regimes and then simulating a move to global free trade (the maximum benefit from a multilateral trade reform) in each of those two cases. The welfare effects of removing the counterfactual price distortions in 2030 are shown to be much larger in the case where agricultural protection grows endogenously than in the case assuming no policy changes over the projection period. This suggests the traditional way of estimating effects of a multilateral agricultural trade agreement may considerably understate the potential welfare gains.","[Anderson, Kym; Jensen, Hans Grinsted; Strutt, Anna] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Jensen, Hans Grinsted] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Strutt, Anna] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Copenhagen; University of Waikato,,Signe.Nelgen@fao.org,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012; Jensen, Hans Grinsted/D-8969-2015","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352; Jensen, Hans Grinsted/0000-0003-3572-0860; Strutt, Anna/0000-0003-1776-2231",Australian Research Council; Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; university of Adelaide; university of Copenhagen; university of Waikato,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation; university of Adelaide; university of Copenhagen; university of Waikato,"Funding support from the Australian Research Council, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the universities of Adelaide, Copenhagen and Waikato is gratefully acknowledged, as are helpful comments from referees.

In Australia, there are many plans to reduce sediment loads by encouraging best management practices; there is also interest in the use of market-based instruments. But it is exceedingly difficult to assess the potential efficacy of market policies, since that requires one to determine how changes in the socio-economic system (e.g. price changes) impact the biophysical (e.g. sediment loads). We use historical data (from 1938 to 2011) in a vector autoregression model to simultaneously model interactions between the economic and biophysical systems in the Burdekin River catchment adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. This allows us to statistically test for the impact of changes in prices on sediment load, while controlling for biophysical influences. We find that extreme events have the most impact on sediment loads, but that prices also impact sediment loads. Evidently market-based policies may have the potential to reduce sediment loads. Our empirical results provide useful information for those interested in the Burdekin River catchment and the GBR; the modelling approach may have wide applicability in a variety of contexts.","[Chaiechi, Taha; Jarvis, Diane] James Cook Univ, Dept Econ, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Stoeckl, Natalie] James Cook Univ, Dept Econ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Stoeckl, Natalie; Lewis, Stephen; Brodie, Jon] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lewis, Stephen] James Cook Univ, Catchment Reef Res Grp, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Chaiechi, T (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Dept Econ, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",taha.chaiechi@jcu.edu.au,"Stoeckl, Natalie/AAU-8562-2020; Jarvis, Diane/R-9166-2017; Lewis, Stephen/P-7205-2016; Chaiechi, Taha/M-2595-2018","Stoeckl, Natalie/0000-0001-5899-4771; Jarvis, Diane/0000-0003-4822-8736; Lewis, Stephen/0000-0002-6929-6626; Chaiechi, Taha/0000-0002-9976-972X",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Tropical Ecosystems Hub - Project [10.2]; James Cook University,Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Tropical Ecosystems Hub - Project(Australian Government); James Cook University,We would like to acknowledge the financial support provided to us by the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program Tropical Ecosystems Hub - Project10.2 and by James Cook University.,,45,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

However, most studies of consumer preferences for sustainable foods only investigate average consumer preferences. They do not take into account that some consumer segments attempt to purchase as much sustainable food as possible, others are almost indifferent to the notion of sustainable food, and still others consider sustainable food a complete hoax. The aim of this study is to explore the preferences for various types of premium eggs across three consumer segments. We conduct a choice experiment including 900 Norwegian consumers and perform a behavioural segmentation based on the frequency of organic food purchase. We find that the segment purchasing the most organic food is, as expected, willing to pay a significant premium for organic eggs over eggs displaying only enhanced animal welfare. However, most consumers, who only occasionally purchase organic products, are unwilling to pay more for organic eggs than for enhanced animal welfare eggs, suggesting diminishing marginal utility for additional attributes. We find that a third consumer segment attempts to avoid organic eggs, even when they cost the same as other eggs. Our findings suggest that organic products will be unsuccessful in acquiring a larger share of the market as long as most consumers are unwilling to pay a premium for organic products with all their cost increasing sustainable attributes over products that have only a single sustainable attribute, in our case enhanced animal welfare.","[Gerini, Francesca] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Syst Management GESAAF, Florence, Italy; [Alfnes, Frode] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Alfnes, Frode; Schjoll, Alexander] Norwegian Consumpt Res Inst SIFO, Oslo, Norway",University of Florence; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Alfnes, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway.;Alfnes, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Consumpt Res Inst SIFO, Oslo, Norway.",frode.alfnes@nmbu.no,"Morscher, Sophie/AFU-6557-2022; GERINI, FRANCESCA/AAA-3002-2021; Alfnes, Frode/I-8970-2016","GERINI, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-4103-1359; Alfnes, Frode/0000-0002-3072-9308",Foundation for Research Levy on Agricultural Products (FFL); Agricultural Agreement Research Fund (JA) through Norwegian Research Council in Norway [190424],Foundation for Research Levy on Agricultural Products (FFL); Agricultural Agreement Research Fund (JA) through Norwegian Research Council in Norway,"We would like to thank Cecilie Mejdell and Julie Foske Johnsen at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute for important help with designing the questions and the information texts used in the choice experiment.

These studies have been of limited use in informing current policy debates because the short- to medium-run reality is one of strong regulatory and infrastructure rigidities that restrict how ethanol can be consumed in the United States. Our objectives in this paper are to provide a more coherent framework than currently exists to model and understand how compliance with ethanol mandates in the short run cannot be met with conventional gasoline blends, how compliance impacts fuel prices and consumer and producer welfare, and also to measure the size of the transfer that occurs between refineries and ethanol producers through the market's Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). In a model calibrated to 2015 data, we find that the effects of increasing ethanol mandates that are physically feasible are close to zero on the retail price of gasoline. This result is robust to different gasoline prices, supply elasticities, and export-demand elasticities. Increased mandates can have a large negative effect on the price of high-level ethanol gasoline blends such as E85 if the mandates are increased to approach consumption capacity.","[Pouliot, Sebastien; Babcock, Bruce A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Pouliot, Sebastien] Ctr Agr & Rural Development, Delhi, India",Iowa State University,"Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA.;Pouliot, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Agr & Rural Development, Delhi, India.",pouliot@iastate.edu,,"Pouliot, Sebastien/0000-0002-5961-5363",Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation [EPS-1101284]; Office Of The Director; EPSCoR [1101284] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office Of The Director; EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),The authors are thankful for critiques and suggestions from three anonymous referees and the editor James Vercammen.

Budgets for purchasing food are limited, and hunger relief agencies often have little influence over the nutritional quality of food they receive through donations. In a recent study, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were calculated monthly using electronic invoice data for food shelves served by two major food banks in Minnesota. While the HEI is directly related to nutrition guidelines and provides great detail in its scoring, implementation requires careful measurement and classification of foods and a rather complex set of calculations. In addition, a significant portion of food distributed by food banks is mixed pallets of free miscellaneous that cannot readily be included in HEI calculations. We propose and test a less data- and labor-intensive measure for characterizing the healthfulness of food distributed by hunger relief agencies. This new measure, the Hunger Relief Nutrition Index (HRNI), facilitates nutritional assessment of miscellaneous foods, allows for easy aggregation of healthfulness scores across food sources and time periods, and correlates well with the HEI.","[King, Robert P.; Warren, Cael] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Cureton, Colin; Hoolihan, Courtney; Grannon, Katherine Young; Nanney, Marilyn S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"King, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",rking@umn.edu,,"Nanney, Marilyn/0000-0002-3463-6416","University of Minnesota's Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [00039202]","University of Minnesota's Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was funded by the University of Minnesota's Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute.

The structure of global agricultural commodity trade is quantitatively described and analysed. Design/methodology/approach - Based on statistical physics and graph theory, the research paradigm of a complex network, which has sprung up in the last decade, provides us with new global perspective to discuss the topic of international trade, especially agricultural commodity trade. In this paper, the authors engage in the issue of countries' positions in international agricultural commodity trade using the latest complex network theories. The authors at first time introduce the improved bootstrap percolation to simulate cascading influences following the breaking down of bilateral agricultural commodity trade relations. Findings - On a mid-level structure, countries are classified into three communities that reflect the structure of the core/periphery using the weighted extremal optimisation algorithm and the coarse graining process. On a micro-level, countries' rankings are provided with the aid of network's node centralities, which presents world agricultural commodity trade as a closed, imbalanced, diversified and multi-polar development. Originality/value - The authors at first time introduce the improved bootstrap percolation to simulate cascading influences following the breaking down of bilateral agricultural commodity trade relations.","[Cai, Hongbo] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Yuanyuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Cai, HB (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hongbocai@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403024]; All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Project [15BZQK231]; Fund for Outstanding Young Talents from Beijing Party Committee Beijing services the National Strategy of 'One Belt One Road'  [2015000020124G060],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Project; Fund for Outstanding Young Talents from Beijing Party Committee Beijing services the National Strategy of 'One Belt One Road' ,"The authors thank the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403024), All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese 2015-2017 Project (15BZQK231), Fund for Outstanding Young Talents from Beijing Party Committee Beijing services the National Strategy of 'One Belt One Road'  (2015000020124G060).

An estimation of market power with price heterogeneity,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural markets; Market power; Dairy industry; Price heterogeneity,PACKING INDUSTRY; OLIGOPOLY POWER; ECONOMIES; GROWTH; SIZE; FOOD,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate market power in dairy industry in China. Specifically, the authors analyze market power for different firm size, locations of region, and city empirically. Design/methodology/approach - The authors estimate the market power by controlling the unobserved price heterogeneity. The econometric model was developed through a typical production function. The authors added three dummy variables to differentiate firms of different sizes, at urban or rural locations, and in east or other regions, according to the characteristics of the dairy industry. A sample including 511 observations were used to do the regression. Findings - The results show that Chinese dairy industry as a whole is a competitive industry in general, while the large firms have gained considerable market power. The firms locate in the eastern area grow slower than firms locate in the middle and western area. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first study to analyze the market power in China's dairy industry by controlling the unobserved price heterogeneity. Dairy is usually thought to be competitive, while in the paper the authors found that large firms can exercise market power while small firms operate in a competitive market.","[Guo, Qing] State Grid Energy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, H.

Individuals extract an input from the pool to produce a consumption good under decreasing average costs. The equilibrium output and population sizes are obtained under two types of usage conjectures. Somewhat counter-intuitively, a cooperative equilibrium results in a larger population of harvesters but lower welfare than the noncooperative one. Some degree of population heterogeneity helps minimise the welfare gap between the two equilibria, but the size of heterogeneity may be a determinant if the resource pool becomes subsequently depleted. The model's potential for policy analysis is illustrated by considering how governance via institutional arrangements and transaction costs may be incorporated and inferred.","[Kwan, Chang Yee] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Kwan, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sppkcy@nus.edu.sg,,"Kwan, Chang Yee/0000-0003-3966-4843",,,,,26,0,0,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Under these conditions, even moderate climate changes are anticipated to drive substantial transformational changes to agricultural systems. Transformations require new investments and infrastructure and can leave some assets stranded. These transformations can be partially or wholly irreversible, and hysteresis effects can make switching difficult and mistakes costly to reverse. This study demonstrates how a real options decision framework, Real Options for Adaptive Decisions' (ROADs), can be used to investigate how uncertainties about the climate affect the adaptation and transformation of agricultural systems. By building upon recent developments in the mathematics of stochastic optimisation, we extend traditional economic analyses of agricultural investment decisions based on net present values to better represent incomplete knowledge and uncertainty. We report results from a case study in South Australia that describes the transition pathways farmers might follow as their industries are transformed in response to climate change.","[Sanderson, Todd; Capon, Tim] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Hertzler, Greg] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Hertzler, Greg] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Capon, Tim] CSIRO, Black Mt, ACT, Australia; [Hayman, Peter] Waite Res Precinct, SARDI, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Pretoria; University of Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Sanderson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",todd.sanderson@sydney.edu.au,"Capon, Tim R/J-5911-2013","Capon, Tim R/0000-0002-5443-6710",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,We would like to gratefully acknowledge the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility in supporting the research leading to this paper and the contribution of two anonymous journal referees.,,25,23,23,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The good financial decision can increase the market value of the owners' equity and poor financial decisions can decrease it. The main objective of financial decisions is to maximize the wealth of stockholders. The effect that capital structure decisions have on profitability and enterprise value is that it increases value through the present value of tax savings from the use of debt. The enterprises can use debt or equity capital to finance their assets. The best what they do is to mixture the debt and equity. This paper analyses how far the capital structure affects the profitability of agricultural holdings in the Czech Republic for a period of six years from 2008 to 2013. Data was obtained from the Albertina and was analysed by using the descriptive statistics, the correlation analysis and the regression analysis. The results show that there is a negative relationship between the short-term debt to the total assets and profitability, between the long-term debt to the total assets and profitability, and between the total debt to the total assets and profitability.","[Stekla, Jana; Grycova, Marta] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Stekla, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",stekla@pef.czu.cz,,,IGA [20131019],IGA,Supported by the IGA research grant No. 20131019 (The analysis of the implementation efficiency of provided subsidies to farm enterprises).,,36,13,13,1,23,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The analysis makes use of individual- and project-level data collected from university and government researchers in the United States. Results show, for instance, that although most genetic resources are exchanged without up-front payments, when up-front payments are required for transfer, recipients are less likely to be expected to contribute monetary or non-monetary benefits after receipt of material. Recipients are also less likely to be subjected to ex post restrictions on the use of the materials they receive. Conversely, when recipients are expected to provide information from project results, up-front payments for genetic materials are less likely to be assessed. The paper concludes that up-front payments can be applied in ways that avoid complex restrictions and obligations that may hinder the exchange of genetic materials, public research, and further innovation.","[Seyoum, Aseffa; Welch, Eric W.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Environm Policy Studies, Sch Publ Affairs, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Seyoum, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Environm Policy Studies, Sch Publ Affairs, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",aseffaw@asu.edu,"Welch, Eric W/D-5097-2015",,"National Institute for Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","National Institute for Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the earlier version.

Agriculture's vulnerability to climate change will depend on both the biophysical impacts of climate change on crop yields and on the agricultural system's ability to adapt to changing production conditions. Shifts in the extent and distribution of irrigated and dryland production are a potentially important adaptation response. Farmer flexibility to adapt may be limited, however, by changes in the availability of irrigation water under future climate conditions. This study uses a suite of models to explore the biophysical and economic impacts of climate change on U.S. fieldcrop production under several potential future climate projections, and to explore the potential limits and opportunities for adaptation arising from shifting regional water balances. The study findings suggest that, while irrigation shortages attributable to climate change have varying effects on cropland use, the aggregate impacts on national production are small relative to the direct biophysical impacts of climate change on yield.","[Marshall, Elizabeth; Aillery, Marcel; Malcolm, Scott; Williams, Ryan] ERS, USDA, Lausanne, Switzerland",,"Marshall, E (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,43,26,35,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The empirical analysis relies on experimental and survey data measuring risk preferences, learning processes, and the adoption of genetically modified (GM) seeds among U.S. grain farmers. While controlling for risk aversion, we link individual learning rules with the cognitive abilities of each decision maker and their actual GM adoption decisions. We find evidence that very few individuals are Bayesian learners, and that the population of farmers is quite heterogeneous in terms of learning rules. This suggests that Bayesian learning (as commonly assumed in the analysis of agricultural technology adoption) is not an appropriate characterization. In addition, we do not find a strong relationship between observed learning styles and the timing of GM seed adoption. To the extent that learning is a key part of the process of technology adoption, this suggests the presence of much unobserved heterogeneity in learning among farmers.","[Barham, Bradford L.; Chavas, Jean-Paul; Schechter, Laura] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Fitz, Dylan] Davidson Coll, Econ Dept, Davidson, NC 28035 USA; [Rios-Salas, Vanessa] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Social Work, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Davidson College; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Fitz, D (通讯作者)，Davidson Coll, Econ Dept, 209 Ridge Rd, Davidson, NC 28035 USA.",dyfitz@davidson.edu,"Fitz, Dylan/AAY-6653-2021",,USDA; Hatch grant,USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Hatch grant,The authors are grateful for funding from USDA in the form of an AFRI grant and a Hatch grant.,,34,44,54,4,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

J,"Gautam, M; Yu, BX",,,,"Gautam, Madhur; Yu, Bingxin",,,Agricultural productivity growth and drivers: a comparative study of China and India,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Productivity; India; Agricultural policy; Food policy; Comparative analysis,,"Purpose - China and India have made significant strides in transforming their agricultural sectors to cut hunger and poverty for the masses through improved agricultural productivity. Given limited land and shift of labor to non-agricultural sector, increasing productivity will continue to be central in agricultural growth in the twenty-first century. The purpose of this paper is to provide comparative analysis of the agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the two countries. It complements existing literature by examining the evolution and drivers of TFP at disaggregated sub-national level. Richer data allows a deeper understanding of the nature and drivers of TFP growth in the two countries. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies different analytical framework to address different research questions using data since 1980. China study estimates a parametric output-based distance function using a translog stochastic frontier function. Productivity growth index and its multiple components are calculated using parameters derived from the parametric approach to identify the characteristics of technology such as structural bias. India study first applies data envelopment analysis to estimate the aggregate productivity growth index, technical change (TC), and efficiency change. Next productivity indexes by for traditional crops are estimated using growth accounting framework at state level. Finally, a panel regression links TFP on its determinants. Findings - Several common themes emerge from this comparative study. Faced with similar challenges of limited resources and growing demand, improving productivity is the only way to meet long-term food security. Agriculture sector has performed impressively with annual TFP growth beyond 2 percent in China and between 1 and 2 percent in India since the 1980s. The TFP growth is mainly propelled by technological advance but efficiency had been stagnant or even deteriorated. This study provides a granular picture of within country heterogeneity: fast growth in the North and Northeast part of China, South and East of India. Research limitations/implications - The study suggests some possible policy interventions to improve agricultural productivity, including investment in agricultural R&D to create advanced production technology, effective extension programs and supportive policies to increase efficiency, and diversification from staple crops for sector-wide growth. The India study suggests certain policies may not be contributing much to productivity growth in the long run due to a negative impact on environment. Further studies are needed to expand the productivity analysis to take into consideration of the negative externalities to the society. Data enhancement to account for quality-adjusted inputs could improve the estimation of productivity growth. Originality/value - Each country study reveals certain prospects of the agricultural sector and production technology. China analysis statistically confirms the existence of technical inefficiency and technology progress, suggests the translog form is appropriate to capture the production technology and satisfies conditions stipulated in theoretical models. The results indicate TC does not influence the contribution of output or input to the production process. India study pinpoints the lagging productivity growth of traditional crops, which still derives growth from input expansion. Although different states benefited from different crops, sector-wide productivity gain is primarily the result of diversification to high-value crops and livestock products.","[Gautam, Madhur] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yu, Bingxin] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Yu, BX (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",byuifpri@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,11,13,5,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - This study makes use of longitudinal survey data from a nearly nationally representative sample of 101 villages spread across five provinces. The outcome variables are cultivated area, sown area and effectively irrigated area, and ordinary least squares regression and fixed effects models are used for the analysis. Findings - In spite of sustained investments into irrigation from 1998 to 2011, there has been almost no impact on agricultural land. Cultivated area and sown area have fallen across all five sample provinces while effectively irrigated area remains largely unchanged. The authors also show that there is no relationship between investment into irrigation and agricultural land. Irrigation facilities also have the lowest rate of rural resident satisfaction of any of the major public services provided. Research limitations/implications - More research is needed to understand the impact of irrigation investment on crop yields and water savings. Practical implications - Policymakers may need to rethink the current pattern of investment into irrigation.

However, using farm-level data for the Australian broadacre industry, we found that constant or mildly decreasing returns to scale is the more typical scenario. In this study, the marginal returns to various farm inputs are compared across farms with different sizes. We found that large farms achieved higher productivity by changing production technology rather than increasing scale alone. The results highlight the disparity between 'returns to scale' and 'returns to size' in the industry, suggesting that productivity improvement among smaller farms can be made through increasing their ability to access advanced technologies, rather than simply expanding their scale.","[Sheng, Yu] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Dept Agr Forestry & Fishery, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zhao, Shiji] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Nossal, Katarina] Int Trade Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland; [Zhang, Dandan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Sheng, Y (通讯作者)，Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Dept Agr Forestry & Fishery, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",yu.sheng@daff.gov.au,"Sheng, Yu/ABC-2411-2020; SHENG, Yu/GXZ-8269-2022",,,,,,43,59,65,5,69,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach - Using monthly price date over the period of January 1998-December 2013 in China, this paper employs an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to explore the cointegration relationship among the price variables and estimate the ARDL long-run price relationship and the short-run error correction process (ARDL-EC). Findings - The empirical results indicate that crude oil, as one of the forcing variables along with wheat, corn, and soybean prices, is effecting rice price in China. Both the long-run and short-run price transmission elasticity estimates suggest the importance of crude oil price on the formation of rice prices. Furthermore, the adjustment speed coefficient is found to be statistically significant, supporting the notion that there is an error correction mechanism for maintaining the long-run price relationship facing short-run shocks. Originality/value - This paper adopts four types of commodity food prices to explore the relationships with crude oil price. The evidence of market integration, including the degree of price transmission and the speed of adjustment, remains a crucial step to proceed with the government intervention.","[Wang, Yumeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shuoli; Liu, Donald J.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN USA; [Yang, Zhihai] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Liu, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",dliu@umn.edu,"Yang, Zhihai/GQP-6872-2022","Wang, Yumeng/0000-0001-8936-2304",Natural Sciences Foundation [71303243]; Education Ministry Social Science Foundation [13YJC630175]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20130004120002]; Mingde Young Scholars Program of Renmin University of China [2013030242],Natural Sciences Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Education Ministry Social Science Foundation; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)); Mingde Young Scholars Program of Renmin University of China,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Natural Sciences Foundation (No. 71303243), Education Ministry Social Science Foundation (No. 13YJC630175), Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (No. 20130004120002), and Mingde Young Scholars Program of Renmin University of China (No. 2013030242).",,31,4,5,1,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

As the decision-making body, farmer's willingness to participate is critical to wetland restoration. It is thus important to understand factors that will affect farmers' willingness to participate and their levels of participation. Using a survey sample of 1,009 farmers from the Poyang Lake wetland area in China, this article applies a hurdle model to empirically investigate the factors affecting individual farmers' sequential decisions on whether or not to participate and how much land to enroll in wetland restoration. Results suggest that farmers' information and knowledge about wetland restoration compensation policy is crucial in determining whether or not to participate in the first stage. Meanwhile, individual farmer characteristics and household attributes play different roles in influencing farmers' participation decisions and acreage enrollment decisions.

Moreover, the analysis at the regional level provides further evidence of the functioning of export controls in a large country. Results suggest a pronounced regional heterogeneity in the strength of domestic price effects of the 2010/11 export ban in Russia. The wheat price dampening effects amount to up to 67% and are strongest in the major wheat exporting region with direct access to the world market. This effect is transmitted to other regions by increased and reversed interregional trade flows.

This study applies a zero-one inflated beta regression to model Murray-Darling Basin irrigators' preferences for market-based water policy programs. Market-based arrangements are more likely to provide efficient solutions to water reallocation problems, particularly where future uncertainty and appropriate pricing induce irrigator preferences for such programs. Our modeling of drivers of irrigator preferences for government expenditure on market-based programs identified different determinants of zero (a corner solution) and proportional outcomes for the reallocation of Murray-Darling Basin water. In addition, the proportional modeling identifies some variables (namely, state regional influences, the type of farm production and recent debt, low income, or water allocation stressors) that increase engagement with market-based programs. Interestingly, while price variables are important and statistically significant, they appear to be less relevant to program engagement than other influences.","[Loch, Adam; Wheeler, Sarah Ann] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Loch, Adam; Wheeler, Sarah Ann] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Boxall, Peter] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Boxall, Peter] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of South Australia; University of Alberta; University of Western Australia,"Loch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Loch, A (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",Adam.Loch@adelaide.edu.au,"Wheeler, Sarah Ann/H-4000-2017; Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013","Wheeler, Sarah Ann/0000-0002-6073-3172; Loch, Adam/0000-0002-1436-8768","ARC [DP140103946, FT140100773]; ARC DECRA [DE150100328]",ARC(Australian Research Council); ARC DECRA(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful for the help of Vic Adamowicz, Darla Hatton MacDonald, and Henning Bjornlund in the design of the original survey.

We allow for smooth transition between free-trade price transmission regimes and those under export restricting regimes, using a smooth transition cointegration (STC) approach, rather than the more common assumption that regime changes are abrupt. Our approach has the advantage that the switch in the price transmission regime may be induced not only by an actual but also by an expected policy change. Results confirm the gradual nature of the transition between the regimes, which reflect trader heterogeneity and wheat storage decisions. We find that the STC approach outperforms alternative model approaches in terms of both regime classification and goodness of fit, when explaining Ukrainian domestic wheat prices under export controls. In particular, application of the Markov-switching error correction model (MSECM) to the same data generates results which do not reflect any identifiable economic reality (in contrast to Gotz et al., 2013).","[Goetz, Linde; Glauben, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Qiu, Feng] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; [Gervais, Jean-Philippe] Farm Credit Canada, Regina, SK, Canada",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University of Alberta,"Götz, L (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",goetz@iamo.de,"Götz, Linde/ACO-5765-2022; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Götz, Linde/0000-0001-8204-4522; Qiu, Feng/0000-0001-8273-8567; Glauben, Thomas/0000-0003-0640-9387","Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Bundesministerium fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BMEL); Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BLE) through the GERUKA project 'Global Food Security and the Grain Markets in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.","Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Bundesministerium fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BMEL); Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BLE) through the GERUKA project 'Global Food Security and the Grain Markets in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.","We acknowledge the support of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Bundesministerium fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BMEL) and the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung, BLE) through the GERUKA project 'Global Food Security and the Grain Markets in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (Globale Ernahrungssicherung und die Getreidemarkte Russlands, der Ukraine und Kasachstans)'.

Using data collected from 2,048 pre- and post-CLP-I interviews of cocoa producers in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Cameroon, the results show that yield enhancements attributable to CLP-I are 32%, 34%, 50%, and 62% in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Cameroon, respectively. Using a total program cost of $151-$200 per beneficiary and estimated annual benefits of $109-$322 per beneficiary over 25 years, the benefit-cost ratios are estimated to range from $18 to $62 for every dollar spent on human capital development. These results suggest the WCF should endeavor to increase the number of farmers who receive all, not some, of the components of the program. This would not only help ensure that each producer obtains as much human capital as possible from each of the training programs but increases the probability of reaching the CLP goal of doubling the income of cocoa-growing households.","[Tsiboe, Francis; Dixon, Bruce L.; Nalley, Lawton L.; Popp, Jennie S.; Luckstead, Jeff] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 217 Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Nalley, LL (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 217 Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",llnalley@uark.edu,"Tsiboe, Francis/A-6485-2018; Nalley, Lawton/AAN-7643-2021","Tsiboe, Francis/0000-0001-5984-1072;",World Cocoa Foundation (WCF),World Cocoa Foundation (WCF),The authors are grateful to World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) for their support.,,39,16,18,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

One possible reason to explain this lack of trading is that we do not have an accurate option pricing model for products where mean reversion in spot-price levels can be expected. Standard option pricing models assume proportionality between price variance and time to maturity. This proportionality is not a valid assumption for commodities whose supply response brings prices back to production costs.

The description of the history of changes of land ownership in the Czech Republic is important for the perception of the current nature of the land use and land market. Land use and ownership was always related to the historical context and political regime. The time periods are divided by the important historical events: after 1918 (foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic), 2nd World War period, after 1948 (takeover of the power by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the centrally planned economy period) and after 1989 (foundation of the market economy). During this era, three land reforms took place. The main role was played by the political apparatus the aim of which was to enhance its economic and political influence, and international interests. It can be concluded that the ownership of land in the Czech lands was always uneven. During the period, the state expropriated land from different society spheres and reallocated it to others. No other property in private ownership underwent so many ownership changes in the legal organization of the state.","[Homolac, Ludek; Tomsik, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Homolac, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",homolac@mzanyas.cz,"Tomsik, Karel/I-2507-2018","Tomsik, Karel/0000-0002-0396-3553",,,,,20,6,7,0,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study are obtained from a large-scale nationwide hog producers' survey in rural China conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2010. A descriptive analysis between hog manure management and its main determinants was conducted. Based on the collected data, an econometric model on the determinants of hog manure management was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - The results of this study suggest that the scale of hog production has an important impact on the pattern of hog manure management. Moreover, the results from descriptive statistics and multivariate estimation suggest that smaller hog producers are more likely to apply hog manure to their own lands, while larger hog producers are more likely to sell the manure or find other ways to dispose of it. Originality/value - This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the impact of structural changes in hog production on hog manure management and the environment.","[Huang, Weiming; Liu, Huaiju] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Weiming] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Qiao, Fangbin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xiangping] Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lohmar, Bryan] US Grains Council China, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Qiao, FB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiaofb@aliyun.com,,,"US Grains Council (USGC); National Science Foundation of China [71333013, 71173204]",US Grains Council (USGC); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support received from the US Grains Council (USGC), the National Science Foundation of China (71333013 and 71173204).",,41,13,14,0,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In 2007, the EU decided on a major reform of its wine policy. A crucial element was the abolishment of a system of planting rights to limit the planting of vineyards. However, after intense lobbying by opponents of the liberalisation, this decision was reversed in 2013. Despite the importance of planting rights in European (and hence global) wine production, and despite the fierce debates surrounding the reforms, no model exists to study the effects of this policy. We develop the first theoretical model of planting rights, integrating the markets for land, planting rights and wine to analyse efficiency and distributional effects. We use the model to study the effects of differences among EU member states in restrictions on trade in planting rights, the role of government reserves and the impact of imperfect enforcement.","[Deconinck, Koen; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Deconinck, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",koen.deconinck@kuleuven.be,"Deconinck, Koen/IVV-6828-2023; Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",KU Leuven (Methusalem Funding),KU Leuven (Methusalem Funding),"The authors wish to thank Julian Alston, Paola Corsinovi, Davide Gaeta and Giulia Meloni for insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

We apply a structural Ricardian approach by modeling the dominant farm type at 9,684 communities as depending on temperature, precipitation and other geographic variables. Rents per farm type are then modeled as depending on climate and other conditioning variables. These results allow the projection of the consequences of climate change as changes in our climate variables. Our results indicate that permanent-crop farms are more likely to dominate in higher temperatures, whereas forage or mixed farms dominate in areas of higher precipitation levels. Land rental prices display a concave response to increases in annual precipitation, and appear to increase linearly with rising annual temperature. Moderate-warming simulation results for future decades benefit most farm types but seem to penalise forage farms. Rental prices are projected to increase, ceteris paribus, for all farm types.","[Chatzopoulos, Thomas; Lippert, Christian] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Prod Theory & Resource Econ 410a, Inst Farm Management, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Chatzopoulos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Prod Theory & Resource Econ 410a, Inst Farm Management, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",t_chatzopoulos@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Chatzopoulos, Thomas/0000-0002-1984-8998",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Thomas Chatzopoulos is a doctoral student with Prof. Christian Lippert in the Department of Production Theory and Resource Economics (410a), Institute of Farm Management, Hohenheim University, 70593 Stuttgart, Germany.

In recognition of hydraulic connectivity between surface and groundwater resources, many states in the western United States have begun to develop systems of conjunctive administration in which property rights for surface water and groundwater are jointly managed. Implementing conjunctive administration requires an understanding of when and where surface and groundwater resources are connected. This article analyzes how decisions about water use and changes in irrigation technology influence connectivity across space and time, generating a challenge for policy instrument design. I develop and estimate an econometric model that reflects the simultaneity in surface and groundwater levels that arises due to the two-way flow of water in a hydraulically connected system. The model also traces the effect of changes in irrigation technology on consumptive water use and return flows, and the consequences for changes in water availability. Estimation results using a panel dataset for the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho from 1960 to 2011 indicate that connectivity between surface and groundwater resources has decreased over time due to declining groundwater levels. Declining groundwater levels are attributable not only to groundwater pumping, but also to a widespread shift from flood to sprinkler irrigation. This transition in irrigation technology has conserved surface water but depleted groundwater by reducing aquifer recharge. As connectivity declines, reducing groundwater pumping to augment surface water flows, a common approach to conjunctive administration, yields diminishing marginal benefits.","Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Cobourn, KM (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,"Idaho Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR); National Science Foundation [EPS-0814387]; Idaho U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [104B, G11AP20076]",Idaho Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Idaho U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),"Kelly M.

This is especially true for the dairy sector. Several countervailing developments took place under transition that affected the dairy industry. Interregional trade became feasible, the importance of milk delivered by households increased significantly, and most dairies became investor-owned companies. The latter point and the fact that the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine detected several price cartels in the industry lead us to offer that after transition, dairies were able to exercise oligopsony power toward dairy producers at the regional level. This paper estimates market structure models for raw milk in Ukraine using a translog production function for the processing sector at the national and regional level. The results suggest the existence of oligopsony power in three of 25 administrative regions in Ukraine, coupled with a potential deviation of procurement prices for raw milk from the value marginal product of raw milk ranging from 24.6% to 49.4%. En Ukraine, la transition a entraine des changements structurels profonds dans la plupart des secteurs economiques, et plus particulierement dans le secteur laitier. Au cours de cette transition, plusieurs mesures ont ete mises en place, mais leurs repercussions sur l'industrie laitiere n'ont pas toutes ete benefiques. Le commerce interregional est devenu possible, la quantite de lait livree par les fermes s'est accrue considerablement et la plupart des laiteries sont devenues des societes par actions. Le fait que les laiteries soient devenues des societes par actions et que le Comite antimonopole de l'Ukraine (Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine) ait detecte plusieurs cartels de prix au sein de l'industrie nous porte a dire qu'apres la transition, les laiteries ont ete en mesure d'exercer un pouvoir d'oligopsone au detriment des producteurs laitiers a l'echelle regionale. Le present article evalue les modeles de structure de marche du lait cru en Ukraine, a l'aide d'une fonction de production translog pour le secteur de la transformation a l'echelle nationale et regionale.

First, there is a bargaining procedure between the European Union (EU) and the rest of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) countries. As soon as an initial agreement is possible, the EU considers various equitable rationing methods to allocate its share to the European Member States. These rationing methods draw upon two different streams of the literature, bankruptcy and burden sharing'. Finally, the European Member States reach a fair agreement through minimising an envy-free index.

This article develops a conceptual model of farmers' production decisions in the context of dual output marketing channels (government and private sector) when output prices at harvest time and the availability of one of the marketing channels are unknown at planting time. It then applies the model to the case of Zambia and uses nationally representative household-level panel survey data to estimate the effects of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), the government parastatal maize marketing board, on smallholder crop production and fallow land. The FRA buys maize from smallholders at a pan-territorial price that typically exceeds market prices in major maize producing areas. Results suggest that increases in the farmgate FRA maize price raise farmer maize price expectations, which induces a supply response. Smallholders respond to an increase in the FRA price by extensifying their maize production. On average, a 1% increase in the FRA price is associated with 0.06% increases in smallholders' maize area planted and quantity harvested. There is also some evidence that farmers reduce the area of land under fallow in response to FRA incentives but there is no evidence of reductions in the area planted to other crops.","[Mason, Nicole M.; Jayne, Thomas S.; Myers, Robert J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Mason, NM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Rm 301D, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",masonn@msu.edu,,,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; United States Agency for International Development Zambia Mission,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); United States Agency for International Development Zambia Mission(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Nicole M.

To do so, we combine a recently developed stochastic production frontier framework with impact evaluation techniques to control for biases stemming from observables and unobservables. First, we find an adequate control group using propensity score matching to mitigate the effect of biases from observable variables. Then, we test for biases that might arise from unobserved variables using a stochastic frontier framework corrected for self-selection. Finally, we estimate meta-frontiers to assess productivity differences between adopters and non-adopters.

Despite this interest, many smallholders in developing countries continue to lack access to updated agricultural information and reliable services. In an effort to increase the effectiveness, impact, and reach of AR&E programs, many governments have attempted to reform their national systems. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper systematically compares the systems and reforms of AR&E in China and India in order to draw out lessons applicable to developing countries. This paper first reviews the existing literature on AR&E systems and their role in agricultural and economic development. The authors then provide a detailed review and comparative analysis of the reforms and approaches implemented in the AR&E systems of China and India. The authors apply this comparative analysis to draw out lessons that can be applied to inform the reformation of AR&E systems in developing countries. Findings - The authors find that although both countries face similar agricultural development challenges, each took a different approach in the reformation of AR&E to address these challenges. Each country's approaches had different impacts on the effectiveness of the system. Lessons from the reformation of the AR&E systems in China and India can be used to inform and improve the impact of AR&E in developing countries. Originality/value - The paper examines two systems together using a set of common indicators and factors. The paper's value comes from its usefulness in informing future AR&E reforms in other developing countries in order to increase the impact of these reforms on development outcomes.","[Babu, Suresh Chandra] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Venkatesh, P.] India Agr Res Inst, New Delhi, India; [Zhang, Yumei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS","Babu, SC (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",s.babu@cgiar.org,,,,,,,72,26,26,1,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

As the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiation is gaining momentum and trade in processed food is becoming more important, it is worth analyzing the impact of this potential trade liberalization on the U.S. and E.U. processed food markets. This study develops a three-region (United States, European Union, and Rest of the World) monopolistic competition trade model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the effects of U.S.-E.U. bilateral tariff elimination and nontariff barrier harmonization on prices, domestic production, bilateral trade, productivity, measure of operating firms, and welfare in the processed food sector. The results show that this trade liberalization expands cross-hauling, with U.S. exports to the European Union increasing by about 95% and E.U. exports to the United States rising by about 87%. This increase in cross-hauling displaces exports from the Rest of the World to the United States and the European Union by approximately 3% and 8%, respectively. U.S. and E.U. total processed food production increases by about 4% and 0.4%, respectively. Because of lower prices and more consumption, net welfare expands in all three regions.","[Luckstead, Jeff] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Devadoss, Stephen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Luckstead, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.;Devadoss, S (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",jluckste@uark.edu; devadoss@uidaho.edu,,,Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-11898854],Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"Jeff Luckstead is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness, University of Arkansas.

When an enforceable payment exists, self enforcement is always sustainable, the highest quality is traded, and any surplus distribution is possible. However, there is a limit to how much bargaining power can be exercised when contracts are fully incomplete, as a seller cannot extract too much of the surplus without breaking down the trading relationship. The results provide insight into the limits of policies that attempt to redistribute bargaining power in markets having informal institutions or in which parties rely on implicit contracts.","[Salas, Paula Cordero] Univ Alabama, Econ Finance & Legal Studies Dept, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Salas, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Econ Finance & Legal Studies Dept, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",,,,"National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, USDA [2008-35400-18701, 2005-35400-15963]; Farm Income Enhancement Program at Ohio State University","National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Farm Income Enhancement Program at Ohio State University","I thank Brian Roe, Stan Thompson, Ian Sheldon, Jack Schieffer, ten anonymous referees, David P Myatt, a discussant, and participants at the 2008 NEUDC Conference at Boston University, the 2009 AAEA & ACCI Annual Meeting, and the economics seminar at the University of Alabama for useful comments.

To inform conservation policy, we model privately optimal land use decisions using a real options framework that assumes both the ecological and commercial values of land are stochastic and that land conversion is irreversible. We analyze permanent and temporary land conservation policy incentives using this dynamic framework to guide policy makers interested in designing efficient payment mechanisms to achieve ecological preservation goals. We find that while the financial cost of temporary policy incentives is generally much lower than permanent policy incentives, this difference is very small in scenarios with high discount rates and lower uncertainties in conversion returns and lower expected trend in conservation returns. Alternately, the financial cost of temporary conservation is substantially lower than that of permanent conservation when the expected trend in conservation returns and uncertainties in conservation and conversion returns is high and the discount rate is low. Comparison with net present value and single-source uncertainty models indicates that the presence of a second uncertainty increases the option value of delaying conversion, and shows that permanent and temporary policy incentives based on either of the two simpler models can be seriously misguided if multiple uncertainties are present. We illustrate the analytical results with a case study of tropical deforestation in Indonesia where private landowners can either conserve forests and earn carbon credits, or convert to palm oil agriculture and earn profits from the sale of palm oil.","[Shah, Payal] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Ando, Amy W.] UlUC, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL USA",Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University,"Shah, P (通讯作者)，Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Onna, Okinawa, Japan.",payal.shah@oist.jp,"Shah, Payal/G-2933-2015","Shah, Payal/0000-0002-9349-4614",USDA-NIFA Hatch project [ILLU-470-316],USDA-NIFA Hatch project,"Payal Shah is a research scientist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Okinawa, Japan.

Approximately 83% of the farmers use at least one farm-based water-saving technique. However, the traditional, inefficient techniques border and furrow irrigation are still prevalent whereas the use of advanced, more efficient techniques is still rather rare. We develop and estimate an adoption model consisting of two stages: awareness of water scarcity and intensity of adoption. We find that awareness of water scarcity and financial status enhance adoption of more advanced techniques whereas access to better community-based irrigation infrastructure discourages it. We furthermore find both community-based irrigation infrastructure and farm-based irrigation water-saving techniques have mitigating effects on production risk. From the results it follows that adoption can be stimulated via financial support and via extension aimed at enhancing awareness of water scarcity.","[Tang, Jianjun] Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Folmer, Henk; Xue, Jianhong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Groningen, Netherlands",Queens University Belfast; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Groningen,"Tang, JJ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.tang@qub.ac.uk,"Jianjun, Tang/AAF-6942-2019","Jianjun, Tang/0000-0002-6994-2093",Medical Research Council [MC_CF023241] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,56,35,40,6,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Our approach is based on the development of a gravity model that takes into account the dynamics at the extensive margin of trade as well as the persistence effect of the intensity of trade. Our empirical contribution is on the egg sector, where the persistence in trading partners is acute. Our results indicate that the use of static models underestimate imports of table eggs by more than 50% in Canada, when compared with the use of panel dynamic specification. The dynamic specification helps explain why trade liberalizations often increase trade creation between countries that had already been trading partners, while new trading partnerships remain scarce following trade liberalization. Our results also confirm the importance of sunk cost and their negative impact on the probability of export market participation for developing countries. Those results raise questions regarding the benefit of trade liberalization for developing countries, in terms of accessing new market, if they do not benefit from special treatments.","[Tamini, Lota D.; Doyon, Maurice; Simon, Rodrigue] Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Pavillon Paul Comtois,Local 4412,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tamini, Lota D.; Doyon, Maurice; Simon, Rodrigue] Univ Laval, Ctr Res Econ Environm Agri Food Transports & Ener, Pavillon Paul Comtois,Local 4412,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Pavillon Paul Comtois,Local 4412,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.;Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ctr Res Econ Environm Agri Food Transports & Ener, Pavillon Paul Comtois,Local 4412,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",lota.tamini@eac.ulaval.ca; maurice.doyon@eac.ulaval.ca; rodriguesimon59@yahoo.fr,,"Tamini, Lota D./0000-0003-3423-3155; Doyon, Maurice/0000-0001-6581-3078",,,,,38,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Analysis of thin agricultural markets has to date been impeded by lack of an appropriate analytical framework from which to study their behavior. In this paper we propose the modern agricultural markets (MAM) framework as an appropriate paradigm through which to view and evaluate thin markets. We argue that thinly traded markets that meet key conditions required for a MAM will generate maximum economic surplus and enable farmers to earn at least a competitive return on their investments. In the absence of these conditions, however, the concerns known as the thin market problem have validity. We set forth the MAM framework, interpret it in a thin-market context, and conduct several brief case studies of thin markets to illustrate use of the approach and draw some key inferences about these markets' behavior. The analysis indicates that appropriate government policies directed to thin markets are those that facilitate their convergence to MAM status, but in reality key policies under recent consideration would have the opposite effect.","[Adjemian, Michael K.] USDA, Econ Res Service, Ames, IA USA; [Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, Davis, CA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, Davis, CA USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,"Adjemian, Michael/X-3833-2019","Adjemian, Michael/0000-0003-4111-8526","US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service [58-3000-3-0052]; University of California, Davis [58-3000-3-0052]","US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of California, Davis(University of California System)","Michael K.

Using purchase data on the French fluid milk sector, we develop a structural econometric model of demand and supply that takes into account the bargaining power between manufacturers and retailers. Our results suggest that the organic label segment is more profitable, as it permits the existence of higher margins. Moreover, an organic label allows manufacturers to achieve more bargaining power relative to retailers, and hence to obtain a higher share of total margins. The econometric model is then used to assess the impact of an environmental policy in favor of the organic segment based on a mechanism of price support. Our results suggest that while a subsidy policy towards organic products benefits both manufacturers and retailers, a tax policy toward conventional products benefits manufacturers of national brands at the expense of retailers and manufacturers that provide the private labels. The benefits of such policies on the environment is relatively small. All such policies tend to increase the impact on global warming and land use, but reduce the impact on eutrophication, acidification, and energy use.","[Bonnet, Celine; Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bouamra-Mechemache, Z (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",Zohra.Bouamra@toulouse.inra.fr,,,French National Program of Research [ANR - 11 - ALID 002 03]; Competition and Bargaining in Vertical Chain French-German project - French National Program of Research,French National Program of Research; Competition and Bargaining in Vertical Chain French-German project - French National Program of Research,"The authors thank Elodie Moutengou for her help on database work and estimations.

Individuals are commonly questioned about their perception of risk in valuation surveys based on stated-preference methods and revealed-preference methods such as averting-behavior models. These subjective and often discrete measures are commonly used to explain individuals' actions to protect themselves against these risks. Perceptions appear as endogenous variables in traditional theoretical averting-decision models but, quite surprisingly, endogeneity of perceived risk is not always controlled for in empirical studies. In this article, we argue that perceptions have to be treated as endogenous to averting decisions in order to produce accurate and reliable measures of households' valuation of water quality improvements. We present various binary averting decision models featuring an endogenous discrete variable (such as risk perception). In particular, we compare the traditional bivariate probit model with the special regressor model, which is less well-known and relies on a different set of assumptions. In the empirical illustration using household data from Australia, Canada, and France, we study how the perceived health impacts of tap water affect a household's decision to drink water from the tap. Individuals' perceptions are found to be endogenous and significant for all models, but the estimated marginal effect is sensitive to the chosen model. Our empirical application also includes some tests of the special regressor estimator's sensitivity to underlying assumptions.","[Bontemps, Christophe; Nauges, Celine] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Bontemps, Christophe; Nauges, Celine] Natl Inst Res Agr, Paris, France; [Nauges, Celine] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; University of Queensland,"Nauges, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Nauges, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Res Agr, Paris, France.;Nauges, C (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",celine.nauges@toulouse.inra.fr,,,Search and Visitors Committee of the School of Economics at the University of Queensland,Search and Visitors Committee of the School of Economics at the University of Queensland,"The authors thank Madhu Khanna and two anonymous reviewers for their very valuable comments and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach - The income mobility method (including static Gini mobility and dynamic income transition matrix) as well as the multinomial logit model) are employed in this paper. Findings - Empirical results indicate that differences in household income were relatively low during the people's commune period. In addition, both Gini mobility and income transition matrix analyses show that income mobility in the long term was faster than that in the short term, suggesting income mobility was beneficial for low-income earners in the long term, i.e., there was an pro-poorness. The major factor influencing household income was the structure of family population, not the quantity of labor input. Originality/value - This paper is the first using income mobility method to study farmers' income disparity and conducting factor decomposition on it in the people's commune period. The micro-data on production team level applied in the paper is of high value, and the paper is helpful to understand the low efficiency of the people's commune.","[Huang, Yingwei] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun; Gu, Zheng] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; China Agricultural University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sirlijun@126.com,,,,,,,40,2,2,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The aim of the paper is to quantify the effects of the individual subsidies that were used by agricultural enterprises according to their profits, losses and revenues. The size structure of agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic is taken into account for more detailed measures of the subsidy impact. The article uses key data such as financial statements of agricultural enterprises and subsidies that were received by companies over the years 2007-2011. The analysis was performed by using the fixed effect model. An evaluation of current economic situation of these enterprises including the structure of drawn subsidies was carried out before the analysis. Different impacts of subsidies on the company's management have been proved. The subsidies influence the medium and large enterprises significantly and positively. A negative impact of subsidies was observed on profits and revenues of small businesses.

The economic model shows that when size-based environmental stringency is also size biased, large farms downsize, expand, or do neither depending on how environmental stringency shifts their marginal production cost relative to their average cost. Empirical testing using data from the top-ten hog-producing states suggests that environmental regulation stringency has limited impact on small farms and leads to a reduction in the number of large farms. Results cannot reject positive size bias at the farm level due to the stringency of environmental regulation.

Accordingly, the UK should realistically remain as an EU member, although continue to lobby for reductions in the CAP budget.","[Boulanger, Pierre] GEM, Sci Po, Paris, France; [Philippidis, George] Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Ctr Food Res & Technol CITA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Philippidis, George] Wageningen Univ, LEI, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Philippidis, George] Univ Loyola Andalusia, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Loyola Andalucia,"Philippidis, G (通讯作者)，Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Ctr Food Res & Technol CITA, Zaragoza, Spain.",gphilippidis@aragon.es,"Boulanger, Pierre/AAW-6397-2020","Boulanger, Pierre/0000-0003-1793-6203",,,,,16,18,19,0,68,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

However, knowledge on how economic transition has affected the structural parameters of food demand is lacking. Based on a two-stage LES-LA/AIDS model and annual panel data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (1995-2010), we provide a comprehensive set of food demand elasticities for Russia along two dimensions. First, we estimate demand parameters for three characteristic time periods in order to trace changes during transition. Second, to account for the Russian population's diversity, we derive elasticities for five different consumer segments. These groups are established by a cluster analysis based on households' food purchases. Our findings suggest that demand for food is far from satiated in Russia. We find generally high unconditional expenditure and own-price elasticities for food. Both expenditure and own-price elasticities show slight decreases in absolute terms over time. Low expenditure elasticities for staple foods like bread or cereals and high values for luxury goods such as meat, alcohol and tobacco suggest considerable changes in the composition of food baskets with further income growth. Results indicate that food production at home loses in importance while more affluent households in particular increase their demand for food consumption away from home.","[Staudigel, Matthias] Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany; [Schroeck, Rebecca] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Staudigel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany.",Matthias.Staudigel@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,58,12,14,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

In the era of a planned economy, local self-sufficiency was dictated by policy. With China's transition to a market economy, however, different policy schemes have been utilized, with greater emphasis placed on the role of market forces, especially in conjunction with China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Nevertheless, self-sufficiency in grain production remains a deeply rooted goal, and interventionist measures geared towards its achievement are still viewed as the most direct and effective means of food security. This paper examines how the well-being of China's rural population, proxied by measures of food consumption, is affected by the promotion of grain production. Our findings suggest that targeted households bear a disproportionate burden of food security policy, as it is currently implemented.","[Zhu, Jing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hare, Denise] Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Zhong, Funing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhangyue] James Cook Univ, Sch Business, AusAsia Business Res Grp, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Nanjing Agricultural University; Reed College - Oregon; Nanjing Agricultural University; James Cook University,"Hare, D (通讯作者)，Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",dhare@reed.edu,,,Priority Academic Program Development of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Natural Science Foundation Commission [71173111]; Michael E. and Carol S.

Conservation tillage can be used to reduce production risk from weather shocks. However, subsidized crop insurance and disaster payments also reduce risk through financial assistance. The paper examines the extent to which risk-reducing tillage practices and government programs are substitutes for each other. The economic model shows that a decline in average weather conditions increases the use of conservation tillage. The economic model also shows that the impact of weather risk and risk aversion on risk-reducing practices like conservation tillage are ambiguous. The effect depends on the degree that losses are offset by government payments. The paper uses county-level tillage practice data from the Conservation Tillage Information Center for the three-state region of Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Results are estimated using instrumental variables and spatial panel data techniques. Instruments for the program participation and payment data include political variables and weather data. The empirical analysis shows that recent disaster and indemnity payments are associated with an increase in the use of no-till and a decrease in the use of other conservation till. Results also show that producers in counties with recent drought and flood events are more likely to use other conservation tillage. The results imply that there may be unintended impacts of changes to agricultural policies like disaster payments and crop insurance on the use of on-farm conservation practices.","[Schoengold, Karina] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Ding, Ya] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Schoengold, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",kschoengold2@unl.edu; dingya@uestc.edu.cn,,"Schoengold, Karina/0000-0001-9378-7129","University of Nebraska Agricultural Research Division Foundation; US Department of Agriculture-NIFA [2012-70002-19387]; University of Nebraska Undergraduate Creative Activities & Research Experiences (UCARE); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry; NIFA [578688, 2012-70002-19387] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","University of Nebraska Agricultural Research Division Foundation; US Department of Agriculture-NIFA; University of Nebraska Undergraduate Creative Activities & Research Experiences (UCARE); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Financial support from the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research Division Foundation Program, US Department of Agriculture-NIFA Policy Research Grant 2012-70002-19387, University of Nebraska Undergraduate Creative Activities & Research Experiences (UCARE), and the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry is gratefully acknowledged.

As of June 2014, there are 53 member countries of the WTO using export tariffs or taxes. Theoretically, a large country which is able to influence the world price of the given commodity could be better off by the export tax levied on it. Practically, there are many problems with implementing this tool of trade policy. Empirical case studies have shown that usually the objectives of this policy were not accomplished. The key problem connected with the export taxation of primary agricultural products is that it can even harm the poor because of the significant share of these products in their consumption. From the point of the world economy as a whole, this policy leads to distortions and efficiency losses.

Design/methodology/approach - Using data from China's 2005 inter-census population survey and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, this paper estimates the effects of children on rural parents' take-up of pension program and the effects of having access to pension on old parents' choice of resource for future old-age support. The effects of China's ORPP on sex ratio are estimated using difference-in-differences identification strategy. Findings - Peasants having sons are less likely to participate in pension program and each additional son and daughter significantly decreases their likelihood of participation. Moreover, the effect of sons is much larger than that of daughters. Peasants having access to pension are less likely to rely on their children for old-age support. The implementation of the ORPP moderately decreased sex ratio. Social implications - Implementing pension program in China's rural area will probably affect rural people's fertility behavior and thus be helpful in correcting sex ratio bias.

As financial incentives are being reduced or phased out, there is a possibility that adoption of this technology will slow down, thus creating a need for improved policy instruments targeted at adoption of residential PV systems. One of the factors affecting adoption of solar technology in the residential sector is its capitalisation in property values. Yet, the awareness of the capitalisation of PV investments in the Australian property market is limited. Our data indicate that homeowners who anticipate selling their properties in the near future are reluctant to adopt PV systems. This paper presents the first empirical estimate of the property price premiums associated with residential solar PV systems in Australia using residential property sales data from the Perth metropolitan area of Western Australia. An estimated 2.3-3.2 per cent property price premium associated with the PV systems suggests that homeowners fully recover the costs of PV investments upon the sale of their properties. Effective government policy could use this information to encourage adoption of residential PV systems by homeowners.","[Ma, Chunbo; Polyakov, Maksym; Pandit, Ram] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Ma, CB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia.",chunbo.ma@uwa.edu.au,"Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011; Polyakov, Maksym/G-1523-2010","Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; Polyakov, Maksym/0000-0002-0193-6658; Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694",Australian Research Council [DE 130100996]; UWA Research Development Award; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); UWA Research Development Award; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council),"We acknowledge the financial support from the Australian Research Council (DE 130100996), UWA Research Development Award, and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

We test different theories that might explain this, and conclude that the shift is mostly the result of revolutionary changes in cultivation practices. The switch from conventional to conservation tillage brought about by changes in herbicide technologies, genetically modified seeds, increased fuel costs, and knowledge of the benefits of soil micro-organisms, has reduced a tenant-farmer's ability to exploit a landowner's soil. This removes a major incentive to cropshare and makes cash renting more attractive. Using USDA field-level data from across the US, we find strong support for this hypothesis, and some evidence that increased corporate structure also influences cash renting. Alternatively, we cannot find evidence that changes in risk, risk-aversion or insurance coverage explain the growth in cash renting.","[Allen, Douglas W.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Borchers, Allison] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",Simon Fraser University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Allen, DW (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",allen@sfu.ca,,,,,,,23,8,10,3,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Health Canada regulates allowable health claims on food products, and in recent years has approved health claims linking the consumption of soluble fiber from barley (2012) and psyllium (2011) to reduced/lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for heart disease. A health claim linking consumption of soy protein to reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is still under consideration. Using a cost-of-illness approach, this paper estimates the potential economic benefits of allowing health claims for soluble fiber and soy protein in terms of reductions in the direct and indirect costs of CHD. Parameters for the economic analysis are drawn from a meta-analysis of scientific studies examining the effect of soluble fiber and soy protein on LDL-cholesterol levels, as well as other scientific literature. While a barley soluble fiber health claim yields nontrivial benefits in a base case scenario equal to CAD$105 million annually and ranging from $42 million to $238 million in low and high scenarios, the potential benefits of a soy protein health claim appear to be several magnitudes larger at $549 million annually in the base case and ranging from $220 million to $1.25 billion in low/high scenarios. Given the relatively slow regulatory approval process for new health claims, there may be value in using economic estimates of potential gains to help prioritize health claims approval processes.","[Malla, Stavroula] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Hobbs, Jill E.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, 51 Campus Dr 3D34-1, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Sogah, Eric K.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 190 Silkstone Rd W, Lethbridge, AB T1J 4C5, Canada",University of Lethbridge; University of Saskatchewan; University of Lethbridge,"Malla, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",s.malla@uleth.ca; jill.hobbs@usask.ca; sogahe@uleth.ca,,"Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817",,,,,78,2,2,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Three effects are considered as major drivers: a 'country effect'; a 'rural effect' (i. e. the more rural a region the larger the amount of support); a 'pure spatial effect' (i. e. the influence of bordering regions and of their degree of rurality). These effects are estimated adopting alternative spatial model specifications: Spatial Durbin Model, Spatial Error Model, Spatial AutoRegressive Model and Spatial Lag of X Model.

For this to occur, label claims have to be truthful, credible, and understandable. We examine the introduction of Raised Without Antibiotics (RWA) label claims in the broiler industry by Perdue Farms (Perdue) and Tyson Foods (Tyson) in 2007 and the events that follow. We ask whether voluntary label claims were able to improve efficiency in the market for RWA chicken products. In this case, evidence presented as part of court testimony suggests that Tyson did not deliver the RWA attribute that consumers demanded, competitors suffered, and Tyson profited from introducing what was ruled to be a false and misleading label claim to the marketplace. While the media informed consumers and stockholders of these events, we found little evidence in publicly available data, literature, or documentation from court cases that Tyson suffered significant harm in the market, or from stockholders. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service did ultimately remove Tyson's label claims from the marketplace, and the legal system provided some redress to competitors and consumers. Even so, labels with animal raising claims (such as RWA) and voluntary, process-based label claims (in general) continue to be challenged by similar issues, that is, consumer confusion, the absence of universally accepted definitions, and varying degrees of credibility.","[Bowman, Maria] USDA, Conservat & Environm Branch, Econ Res Serv, ERS USDA, Sunbury, PA 17801 USA; [Marshall, Kandice K.] ERS USDA, Crops Branch, Washington, DC USA; [Kuchler, Fred] ERS USDA, Agr Econ Diet Safety & Hlth Econ Branch, Washington, DC USA; [Lynch, Lori] ERS USDA, Conservat & Environm Branch, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Bowman, M (通讯作者)，USDA, Conservat & Environm Branch, Econ Res Serv, ERS USDA, Sunbury, PA 17801 USA.",maria.bowman@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,104,20,24,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We develop a general model to analyse the strategic motive of using standards to limit supply and shift rents between farmers and processors in the vertical chain. We find that a stringent standard can raise farmers' profit, but at the expense of processors. This is the case when the standard affects more variable costs than fixed cost of production, when the demand for the final product is inelastic, and when processors have a high degree of oligopoly power.","[Yu, Jianyu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra] Gremaq INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Bouamra-Mechemache, Z (通讯作者)，Gremaq INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",zohra.bouamra@toulouse.inra.fr,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71373210]; French National Program of Research [ANR-11-ALID 002 03],National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); French National Program of Research,J.Y. thanks the financial support of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC Project 71373210).

Based on this gap in the research, the purpose of this paper is to examine how on-the-job training affects rural migrant workers' job mobility in China. Design/methodology/approach - By using randomly sampled survey data on migrant workers in Liaoning province in 2014, the authors applied a logistic model and survival analysis to explore the effect of on-the-job training on migrant workers' job turnover and understand workers' job change behaviour after receiving on-the-job training. Findings - The results showed that job training provided by employers can significantly reduce migrant workers' turnover by increasing specific human capital. By contrast, training provided by the government or migrant workers themselves focuses on increasing general human capital and thus fails to reduce job turnover. Moreover, further discussion revealed that, in the trained group, those people with a short tenure and low wage in the first job, people without any skills before migration, male migrant workers, and people that work in medium-sized and large cities have a higher probability of changing jobs. These findings suggest that to tackle the high rate of job mobility among rural migrant workers, firms should entice this labour to train by adjusting their internal training mechanisms, and local governments should subsidize firms that provide on-the-job training for rural migrant workers to help share the costs and risks of training. Moreover, for sake of reducing job changing among those trained workers, firms even should take actions to protect their labour rights of migrant workers and to ensure that they receive equal treatment to their urban counterparts. Originality/value - This paper makes three contributions to the field of job mobility in China. First, it explores the mechanism between on-the-job training and rural migrant workers' job mobility. Second, it empirically analyses the effect of on-the-job training on migrant workers' job mobility as well as the different effects of general and specific training. Lastly, its results have important policy implications for the employment stability of rural migrant workers.","[Jiang, Jinqi; Zhang, Guangsheng; Qi, Diming; Zhou, Mi] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University,"Jiang, JQ (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",jiangjinqi812@163.com,"jiang, jinqi/Q-1800-2016; Zhou, Mi/JJC-6514-2023; ZHANG, Guangsheng/I-5774-2015","Zhou, Mi/0000-0002-8932-1315; ZHANG, Guangsheng/0000-0003-1482-9429","Youth Project of the Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education [13YJC790057, 14YJC90094]; Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University [WJQ2015026]","Youth Project of the Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education; Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided to collect the data used in this study: Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (L12BG012), Youth Project of the Philosophy and Social Science Research, Ministry of Education (13YJC790057, 14YJC90094), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71303161, 71203146, 71273179), Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University (WJQ2015026).",,27,5,7,10,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In response to these changes, China's Government introduced the New Rural Social Pension Program (NRSPP) in 2009, a voluntary and highly subsidized pension scheme. The purpose of this paper is to assess the participation of rural farmers in the NRSPP. Furthermore, the authors examine whether the NRSPP affects the labor supply of the elderly population in China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses household-level data from a sample of 2,020 households originating from a survey conducted by the authors in five provinces, 25 counties, and 101 villages in rural China. Using a probitmodel and conducting correlation analysis, the authors demonstrate the factors affecting the participation and the impact of NRSPP on labor supply of the rural elderly. Findings - The results show there are several factors that are correlated with participation, such as specific policy variant in force in the respective household's province, the size of the pension payout from government, the age of sample individuals, and the value of household durable assets. Specifically, different characteristics of NRSPP policy implementation increase participation in China's social pension program. The results suggest that the introduction of the NRSPP has not affected the labor supply of the rural elderly, in general, although it has reduced participation for the elderly who were in poor health. Originality/value - Several previous studies have covered the NRSPP. However, all previous studies were based on case studies or just focused on a small region, and for this reason the results cannot reflect the populations and heterogeneity of rural areas. Therefore, a data set with a large sample size is used in this paper to provide a new perspective to fully understand the participation of NRSPP and its impacts on rural households. This paper will make an update contribution to the literature in the area of pension programs in China.","[Zhao, Qiran] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Brosig, Stephan] IAMO, Halle, Germany; [Luo, Renfu] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yue, Ai] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","China Agricultural University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Shaanxi Normal University; Stanford University","Luo, RF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",luorf.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; zhao, qiran/GSI-5490-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023","Zhao, Qiran/0000-0003-1526-2057",,,,,28,10,14,4,71,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

To overcome these issues, we develop an approach to generate stated preference data and combine them with revealed preference data to estimate price elasticities from various types of water entitlement sales in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Our results suggest that price elasticities of demand and supply of high security water entitlements are inelastic in the relevant market price range between AUD >2,100 per mega-liter, and that supply is relatively more inelastic than demand. For lower reliability water entitlements, the price elasticity of demand is estimated to be even more inelastic than high security water entitlements. The price elasticity of supply for general security water entitlements is similar to high security water entitlements, while the supply of low reliability water entitlements is extremely inelastic for our data set. The comparison between the stated and revealed preference data provides strong evidence of support for a data fusion approach; nevertheless, some differences in water sale preferences were found for irrigators choosing not to sell all of their water. The consistency of our results signals support for the use of this methodology in other water basins around the world.","[Zuo, Alec; Wheeler, Sarah Ann] Univ Adelaide, Global Food Studies, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Zuo, Alec; Wheeler, Sarah Ann] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Adamowicz, W.

Building on research on cognitive dissonance and confirmatory bias, this study shows that consumers tend to inadequately process (food safety) information, pay limited attention to signals, and make purchase decisions that are biased toward their initial choices. Using an incentive compatible auction mechanism, this study elicited consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) under different informational settings. Results showed that consumers were willing to pay much higher prices when they chose to commit to food items (treatment) than when they were randomly assigned (control), suggesting cognitive dissonance. The gaps in WTP were further enlarged as food safety information was revealed to consumers. Confirmatory bias was supported by findings that those who made an earlier commitment were more reluctant to change their WTPs despite increased risk perceptions. In terms of market responses, demand curves were less likely to shift down in the presence of food safety risks because consumers were less responsive to public information due to their existing habits and psychological biases. Specialized targeted strategies will be necessary to target those who are heavy or recent users of the target food when there is a food safety scare.","[Cao, Ying (Jessica)] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ FARE, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Just, David R.; Turvey, Calum; Wansink, Brian] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",University of Guelph; Cornell University,"Wansink, B (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 114 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ycao01@uoguelph.ca; drj3@cornell.edu; cgt6@cornell.edu; foodandbrandlab@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012","Cao, Ying/0000-0002-5907-8959",,,,,33,12,12,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Comparable tax rates for the two special taxes to generate similar government revenue are derived. For approximate revenue neutral taxes, the efficiency and distributional effects of the royalty and resource rent tax options are assessed and compared. In terms of efficiency, the superiority of one over the other is ambiguous because of imperfect knowledge about key parameters. In terms of returns to Australia, and in particular the aggregate of transfers from nonresident shareholders and export buyers, both provide similar outcomes.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Freebairn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",j.freebairn@unimelb.edu.au,"freebairn, john/O-6199-2015","freebairn, john/0000-0002-1480-4953",,,,,18,9,11,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Such models are appropriate only when all members of the population of interest actually produce the good. In some contexts, however (e.g., smallholder farmers), many members of the population do not produce particular goods that they could produce and that their neighbors do produce. Policies influencing market participation among producers may thus also induce additional farmers to become producers. Previous double-hurdle approaches do not allow explicitly for this possibility. To address these limitations, this article presents a triple-hurdle approach with an initial stage that includes nonproducers. The model is used to identify the factors associated with Kenyan smallholder farmers choosing to participate in dairy production, and the role that these producers choose to play (or not) in the marketplace. In the midst of debates underway over the privatization of the parastatal Kenya Creameries Company, new knowledge about smallholder participation in dairy could be an important contribution. Results suggest the importance of rural electrification, training, and improved grazing practices. We find that expected net sales are significantly higher when farmers have access to informal private markets. We also describe a version of the ordered tobit model that includes nonproducers and is nested in our triple-hurdle model. A likelihood ratio test shows the latter to be a significantly better fit to our data. We discuss how insights gained from this study differ from the insights that would come from a double-hurdle ordered tobit that also includes nonproducers.","[Burke, William J.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Myers, Robert J.; Jayne, Thomas S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Stanford University; Michigan State University,"Burke, WJ (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",burkewi2@stanford.edu,"Burke, William J/AAI-9265-2020","Burke, William J/0000-0003-4961-2211",USAID/Kenya under the Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis Project,USAID/Kenya under the Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Funding for this research was provided by USAID/Kenya under the Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis Project.

In 2012, the province granted an exemption from the tax to certain agricultural sectors. Using commodity-specific trade flows and exploiting cross-provincial and intertemporal variation, we find little evidence that the carbon tax is associated with any meaningful effects on agricultural trade despite the sector being singled out as at risk by the provincial government.

This is mainly because hybrid rice provides a yield gain of 15-20 per cent over conventionally bred varieties in general. Yet, despite strenuous government efforts, farmers' adoption rates have remained low in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam compared with China. Although studies often claim that higher seed costs and inferior grain quality are the major factors limiting hybrid rice adoption, very few studies examine the importance of socio-economic factors and infrastructure in the adoption of hybrid rice. Using Bangladesh as a case, a comparative analysis has been made on the adoption of hybrid and modern varieties relative to traditional rice varieties and land allocation to these varieties. Econometric results indicate that general land characteristics, loan facilities and general infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation facilities and the availability of government-approved seed dealers, significantly influence the adoption of hybrid and modern rice varieties and land allocation to these varieties compared with traditional varieties.","[Mottaleb, Khondoker A.; Mohanty, Samarendu; Nelson, Andrew] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Los Banos, Philippines",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，CIMMYT, CSISA MI, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org,"Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019; Nelson, Andy/G-3649-2012","Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152; Nelson, Andy/0000-0002-7249-3778",,,,,35,36,39,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Propensity score matching (PSM) and regression-based approaches that account for potential bias due to selection problems from observable variables are used to achieve the objective of the study. Sensitivity of our IPM-FFS impact results to potential bias due to selection on unobservables was also assessed. We find that farmers who participate in the IPM-FFS training program have statistically lower insecticide expenditures than the non-IPM-FFS farmers. But we do not find any evidence that the IPM-FFS training program significantly affects yield and the other inputs. There is some evidence indicating that IPM-FFS farmers may have statistically higher profit levels than non-IPM-FFS producers, but these results are sensitive to and may still be invalidated by bias due to unobservable variables. Since IPM-FFS seem to only significantly reduce insecticide use, policymakers and extension educators may need to adjust the IPM-FFS curriculum to further emphasize (or include) other agronomic practices that also optimize the use of other inputs like labor, fertilizer, and herbicides. The more efficient use of all inputs would likely reduce total expenditures and eventually translate to higher incomes.","[Sanglestsawai, Santi] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Yorobe, Jose M.] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, Laguna 4031, Philippines",Kasetsart University; North Carolina State University; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"Rejesus, RM (通讯作者)，NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",rod_rejesus@ncsu.edu,,"Sanglestsawai, Santi/0000-0003-3196-1712",IPM Innovation Lab through USAID [EPP-A-00-0400016-00],IPM Innovation Lab through USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding support of the IPM Innovation Lab (formerly IPM-CRSP) that was made possible through USAID Cooperative Agreement No. EPP-A-00-0400016-00.

This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia's Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufficient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.","[Eagle, Alison J.; Eagle, David E.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Eagle, Alison J.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stobbe, Tracy E.] Trinity Western Univ, Sch Business, Langley, BC, Canada; [van Kooten, G.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on household survey data collected from three sample counties in the Loess Plateau region, the paper analyzes how spatial heterogeneity and business diversification have affected the production efficiency of households participating in the SLCP. Using four-step bootstrap, input stochastic distance frontiers of multi-inputs and multi-outputs are developed simultaneously with a technical efficiency effects model in which participating in the SLCP is treated as an exogenous variable. Findings - The household production in the three counties is constrained by land, labor, capital, and fixed inputs; thus, it is germane to using a multi-input and multi-output household production technology to evaluate the SLCP. However, the relative importance of each input and output, the productive diversification, and the technological structure are differentiated in the three counties; estimating the regression with pooled data appears to conceal the influences of local factors and blur the specific divergence, compared to running county-based, separate regressions. Research limitations/implications - The effects of the SLCP on farm household production are location dependent. It is necessary to include spatial heterogeneity within public policy evaluation. In addition to suggesting localized and differentiated schemes of subsidy, this implies that the government may provide means to facilitate different regions to make the economic transition. Originality/value - This paper intends to make two contributions. First, the analysis will capture and explain the adjustments induced by the SLCP in off-farm and other activities for entire household production, and special attention is given to the diversification of household production outputs. Second, this analysis sheds new light to the significance of spatial differentiation in mediating the effectiveness of a public policy or program.","[Zhao, Minjuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Appl Econ Ctr, Yangling, Peoples R China; [Yin, Runsheng] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yao, Liuyang; Xu, Tao] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Michigan State University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Yin, RS (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",yinr@anr.msu.edu,"Yin, Runsheng/C-5972-2014","Yao, Liuyang/0000-0003-4526-3333; Xu, Tao/0000-0003-3960-4613",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373209],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank Shunbo Yao and Pei Jin for assistance in the original research effort.

Yet academics have also voiced concerns against seeing PES as a panacea. This article discusses whether PES is an appropriate and promising approach to promote so-called climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, which we define as agricultural production practices that contribute to CO2 emission reductions and/or removals and provide benefits to farmers via increased productivity and profits and reduced vulnerability to climate change. PES appears most promising for the promotion of CSA practices in small-scale farming contexts with low incomes. Effective design, however, requires solid estimates of cost and benefit flows from CSA adoption over time, accounting for differences in socioeconomic and ecological conditions, and addressing the risk of leakage. Funding for such PES will likely have to come from public sources, and seems most promising where synergies with other objectives such as agricultural development, food security, and climate adaptation or other environmental services exist. The potential of alternative approaches for CSA support such as taxation with rebates for CSA practices, CSA-related investment support such as microcredits, and hybrid approaches such as conditional microcredit should be further investigated.","[Engel, Stefanie] Univ Osnabruck, Environm Econ, Osnabruck, Germany; [Muller, Adrian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Muller, Adrian] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Frick, Switzerland",University Osnabruck; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Engel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Environm Econ, Osnabruck, Germany.",stefanie.engel@uos.de,"Engel, Stefanie/B-6533-2009","Engel, Stefanie/0000-0002-3568-5500; Muller, Adrian/0000-0001-7232-9399",Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF through the National Research Programme Sustainable Use of Soil as a Resource [NRP 68],Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF through the National Research Programme Sustainable Use of Soil as a Resource(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback on an earlier draft.

Recently, Rose has called into question the reliability of this conclusion, as new techniques have emerged for estimating gravity equations. This article uses the sector-specific gravity model developed by Anderson and Yotov (2010a) to investigate if disaggregated trade can provide a reliable estimate of a common currency's effect. Disaggregating trade alone is insufficient to obtain a reliable estimate of a currency union, regardless of econometric technique, when the effect of a common currency on trade is uniform across all unions. Disaggregating the universe of currency unions with individual effects provides a reliable ranking of currency unions, independent of estimation method, by the effect that each union's currency has on increasing trade. These rankings differ across sectors.","[Whitten, Gregory W.] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Room 302,Dorothy YL Wong Bldg,8 Castle Peak Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Whitten, GW (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Room 302,Dorothy YL Wong Bldg,8 Castle Peak Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",gregorywhitten@ln.edu.hk,,"WHITTEN, Gregory William/0000-0002-4043-5258",,,,,41,1,1,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The objective is to better understand the effect of prices and scale of production on Marshallian shutdown price, input choice, and by-product choice. We estimate a novel specification of a cost function capable of accommodating two distinctive features of ethanol plants' technology: (1) the production process results in by-products that can be sold in different forms in response to price signals, and (2) decisions on the mix of by-products may be subject to constraints, such as thin livestock markets or imperfect price foresight. This cost function is estimated by nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression with correlated random effects. Constant returns to variable inputs, homotheticity, and proportionality of by-products to ethanol production, assumptions held in previous studies, are strongly rejected by our analysis. Increases in ethanol production require less than proportional increases in corn and other variable inputs when the increases are achieved through increased capacity utilization as opposed to capacity expansion. Moreover, the reduction in input requirements per gallon, reduces both cost and greenhouse gas emissions per gallon. Constraints in by-product marketing decisions seem to slightly increase Marshallian shutdown price.","[Sesmero, Juan P.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, KRAN 591A, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Perrin, Richard K.] Univ Nebraska East Campus, Dept Agr Econ, 208 Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Fulginiti, Lilyan E.] Univ Nebraska East Campus, Dept Agr, 208 Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Sesmero, JP (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, KRAN 591A, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsesmero@purdue.edu; rperrin@unl.edu; lfulginiti1@unl.edu,,,"Agricultural Research Service, University of Nebraska; USDA regional project [NC506]","Agricultural Research Service, University of Nebraska(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); USDA regional project","Study supported by the Agricultural Research Service, University of Nebraska, and USDA regional project NC506.",,41,4,5,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This assumption is in disagreement with many other studies that document such bias. We show that models of preference anomalies are mathematically equivalent to models of perception anomalies when estimating perceptions and/or preferences based on observable risky choice data. Empirical models admitting both involve multiplicative functions of common variables and are discernible only by assuming specifications that arbitrarily separate the two. This inability to separately identify preferences and probability perceptions is not readily solved by experimental means. Vastly different combinations of preference and perception modifications fit behavioral data identically, implying that Arrow-Pratt risk aversion estimates are arbitrary. In contrast, the risk premium and certainty equivalent are identifiable without unverifiable and untestable separating assumptions, and provide sufficient statistics for policy and welfare analysis regardless.","[Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Just, Richard E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Cornell University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Just, DR (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",drj3@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012",,,,,,44,22,24,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We retain a Linear Approximated Almost Ideal Demand System specification. A Full-Information Maximum Likelihood estimation procedure is used to deal with corner solution problems and censored data. The estimation is based on two cross-sections covering pesticide use of three major crops cultivated in France in 2001 and 2006. Our results show that farmers' response to price variation is very low, especially for 2001. Furthermore, elasticities of pesticide expenditure are significantly different across categories: the highest levels are obtained for fungicides and the lowest ones for insecticides. Finally, we find higher own-price elasticities for herbicides and fungicides than for insecticides, which are less frequently used.","[Fadhuile, Adelaide; Pirotte, Alain] Univ Paris 02, CRED, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris 05, France; [Fadhuile, Adelaide; Pirotte, Alain] CNRS, TEPP, F-75700 Paris, France; [Lemarie, Stephane] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, INRA, BP 47, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Fadhuile, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, CRED, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris 05, France.;Fadhuile, A (通讯作者)，CNRS, TEPP, F-75700 Paris, France.",Adelaide.Fadhuile-Crepy@u-paris2.fr; stephane.lemarie@grenoble.inra.fr; Alain.Pirotte@u-paris2.fr,,"Lemarie, Stephane/0000-0003-1530-3787",,,,,73,2,2,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The presence of complementarity among producer decisions can have far-reaching implications for market outcomes and for the effectiveness of policies intended to influence them. Identifying complementarity relations, however, is made difficult by the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. Drawing on recent methodological advances, in this paper we develop a test for complementarity between glyphosate tolerant soybeans and conservation tillage that overcomes certain limitations of previous studies. Specifically, we develop a structural discrete choice framework of joint soybean-tillage adoption that explicitly models both complementarity and the correlation induced by unobserved heterogeneity. The model is estimated with a large unbalanced panel of farm-level choices spanning the 1998-2011 period. We find that glyphosate tolerant soybeans and conservation tillage are complementary practices. In addition, our estimation shows that farm operation scale promotes the adoption of both conservation tillage and glyphosate tolerant seed, and that all of higher fuel prices, more droughty conditions, and soil erodibility increase use of conservation tillage. We apply our results to simulate annual adoption rates for both conservation tillage and no-tillage in a scenario without glyphosate tolerant soybeans available as a choice. We find that the adoption of conservation tillage and no-tillage have been about 10% and 20% higher, respectively, due to the advent of glyphosate tolerant soybeans.","[Perry, Edward D.; Moschini, GianCarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Elton R Smith Chair Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Econ, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Michigan State University; Iowa State University,"Moschini, G (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA.",moschini@iastate.edu,,,USDA NIFA Policy Research Center [11061138/2012-01764],USDA NIFA Policy Research Center,The authors thank editor JunJie Wu and the journal's reviewers for their helpful comments.

Historically, there have been major changes in beer consumption in the world. In recent times, per capita consumption has decreased in traditional beer drinking countries while it increased strongly in emerging economies. Recently, China has overtaken the US as the largest beer economy. A quantitative empirical analysis studies the relationships among economic growth, globalisation and beer consumption. The relationship between income and beer consumption has an inverse U-shape. Beer consumption initially increases with rising incomes; but at higher levels of income beer consumption falls. Increased globalisation has contributed to a convergence in alcohol consumption patterns across countries. In countries that were originally beer drinking countries, the share of beer in total alcohol consumption reduced, while this is not the case in countries which traditionally drank mostly wine or spirits.","[Colen, Liesbeth] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, LICOS, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Colen, Liesbeth] European Commiss, JRC, Louvain, Belgium; [Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance LICOS, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Swinnen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Econ, Waaistr 6,Bus 3511, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",jo.swinnen@kuleuven.be,"Colen, Liesbeth/ABD-1677-2021; Colen, Liesbeth/E-5790-2019; Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Colen, Liesbeth/0000-0003-1324-2570",,,,,62,81,87,3,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We show that the weak complementarity assumption and the Willig condition, the common preference assumptions used to support the revealed preference methods for non-market valuation, may be tested as parameter restrictions. A study of water quality valuation is presented to illustrate the proposed empirical strategy.

Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data. Findings - Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both average climate conditions and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets. Originality/value - The analysis results suggest farmers are using groundwater markets to help them adapt to climate change. Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP.","[Zhang, Lijuan; Zhang, Guangsheng] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinxia] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiuqiong] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Shenyang Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville","Zhang, GS (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.;Wang, JX (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jxwang.ccap@pku.edu.cn; gzhang@syau.edu.cn,"wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; Zhang, Li/GWM-7501-2022; huang, qiuqiong/A-8130-2009; Zhang, Liqun/JDN-3523-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; ZHANG, Guangsheng/I-5774-2015","Huang, Qiuqiong/0000-0002-3354-5213; ZHANG, Guangsheng/0000-0003-1482-9429",,,,,30,3,3,1,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We extend their analysis to incorporate farmers who are heterogeneous in ability to produce high-quality products. We show that the revenue-pooling benefits of cooperation may be sufficient to cause high-quality producers to join a cooperative and pool revenues, at least partially, with lower-quality producers.

Despite the important role of land in rural livelihoods and as a form of wealth in many Asian countries, surprisingly few nationally representative data exist on women's property rights in Asia. This paucity hinders the formulation and implementation of appropriate policies to reduce gender gaps in land rights. This article reviews the existing micro-level, large sample data on men's and women's control of land, identifies what can and cannot be measured by these data, and uses these measures to assess the gaps in the land rights of women and men. Utilizing nationally representative individual-and plot-level data from Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Vietnam, and Timor-Leste, we calculate five indicators: incidence of landownership, distribution of landownership, distribution of plots owned, mean plot size, and distribution of land area, all by sex of owner. The results show large gender gaps in landownership across countries. However, the limited information on joint and individual ownership are among the most critical data gaps and thus are an important area for future data collection and analysis.","[Kieran, Caitlin; Sproule, Kathryn; Quisumbing, Agnes] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Doss, Cheryl] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kim, Sung Mi] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Yale University; Stanford University,"Doss, C (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, POB 208206, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Cheryl.doss@yale.edu,,"Doss, Cheryl/0000-0001-8292-3295",,,,,63,55,57,2,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We propose to tackle endogenous input ratios appearing in the normalized IDF by considering a flexible (simultaneous) system of the IDF and the first-order conditions from the firm's cost minimization problem. Our model can accommodate both technical and (input) allocative inefficiencies among firms. We also present the algorithm for quantifying the cost of allocative inefficiency. We showcase our cost-system-based model by applying it to study the production of Norwegian dairy farms during the 1991-2008 period. Among other things, we find both an economically and statistically significant improvement in the levels of technical efficiency among dairy farms associated with the 1997 quota scheme change, which a more conventional single-equation stochastic frontier model appears to be unable to detect.","[Tsionas, Efthymios G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Malikov, Emir] St Lawrence Univ, Canton, NY USA",Athens University of Economics & Business; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Saint Lawrence University,"Tsionas, EG (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece.",tsionas@aueb.gr; kkar@binghamton.edu; emalikov@stlawu.edu,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106",,,,,29,21,21,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The empirical analysis is performed through a gravity model that accounts for vertical linkages between primary and processed goods. The estimated gravity parameters are used to implement suspension agreement scenarios. The results show that the new suspension agreement leads to considerable decreases in Mexico's exports of fresh tomatoes to the United States. These decreases are accompanied with various trade diversion and deflection effects. There are increases in Mexico's exports of processed tomato products to the United States and other countries, and in Mexico's exports of fresh tomatoes to non-U.S. destinations. These increases do not amount, however, to considerable compensations of the decreases in Mexico's fresh tomato exports to the United States. The results also suggest that the initial 1996-based suspension agreement has significantly smaller impacts on trade flows over the period that preceded the implementation of the new suspension agreement. Dans le present article, nous traitons des repercussions du nouvel accord de suspension (conclu le 4mars2013 entre le gouvernement des Etats-Unis et les producteurs de tomates du Mexique) touchant le commerce des tomates fraiches et des produits de tomates transformees. Nous avons effectue l'analyse empirique a l'aide d'un modele gravitaire qui tient compte des liens verticaux entre les produits primaires et les produits transformes. Nous avons utilise des parametres gravitaires estimatifs pour elaborer des scenarios d'accord de suspension. Selon les resultats de notre analyse, ce nouvel accord de suspension cause une baisse considerable des exportations de tomates fraiches du Mexique vers les Etats-Unis ainsi qu'un deplacement des echanges. Les exportations de produits de tomates transformees du Mexique vers les Etats-Unis et d'autres pays ainsi que les exportations de tomates fraiches du Mexique vers des destinations autres que les Etats-Unis augmentent. Toutefois, ces hausses ne compensent pas la baisse des exportations de tomates fraiches du Mexique vers les Etats-Unis. Les resultats de notre etude permettent de penser que l'accord de suspension initial conclu en 1996 a eu des repercussions beaucoup moins considerables sur le flux des echanges pendant la periode qui a precede la mise en OEuvre du nouvel accord de suspension.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Ghazalian, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr West, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",pascal.ghazalian@uleth.ca,,"Ghazalian, Pascal/0000-0002-6230-6879",,,,,45,3,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Here, we examine these effects in the beef sector where full decoupling was not obligatory.

This effect is examined in the context of Ontario's Greenbelt legislation, which prohibits urban development of rural land within a large area around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). This preserved area includes not only agricultural properties but also a substantial amount of rural residential properties due to proximity to the GTA. With the amenity value that rural residential properties derive from the surrounding rural landscape, the imposed development restrictions that permanently preserve this open space are anticipated to increase the values of these properties. This expectation is confirmed by the results of a hedonic approach, which indicate a positive effect on the values of rural residential properties within the Greenbelt's boundary. This effect is found to be greater for properties with more surrounding open space and those that are relatively closer to the GTA. These results also provide an estimate of the property value impact of converting all surrounding developable open space to permanently preserved open space. Tandis que des etudes anterieures se sont interessees plus particulierement aux repercussions des politiques d'utilisation des terres sur la valeur des proprietes agricoles et residentielles situees a proximite d'aires protegees, le present article s'interesse aux repercussions de ces politiques sur la valeur des proprietes residentielles rurales situees a l'interieur des aires protegees. Ces repercussions ont ete examinees dans le contexte de la Loi sur la ceinture de verdure de l'Ontario, qui interdit le developpement urbain des terres rurales situees dans un vaste perimetre entourant la region du Grand Toronto (RGT). En plus des proprietes agricoles, cette aire protegee compte un nombre important de proprietes residentielles rurales en raison de la proximite de la RGT. Compte tenu de la valeur d'agrement que les proprietes residentielles rurales retirent du paysage rural environnant, on prevoit que les restrictions au developpement destinees a proteger de facon permanente ces espaces verts accroitront la valeur de ces proprietes. Les resultats d'une analyse hedonique, montrant des repercussions positives sur la valeur des proprietes residentielles rurales situees a l'interieur du perimetre de la ceinture de verdure, confirment cette prevision. Ces repercussions semblent plus importantes dans le cas des proprietes qui possedent un vaste espace vert environnant et des proprietes qui sont situees a proximite de la RGT.
